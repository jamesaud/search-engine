Smuggling Hope. Or Why Drug Benefits Matter

My father was dying, and the drug company wanted $47,000 for his medication.
So I did what any daughter would do: I became a liar and a fraud.

   Two years ago my father phoned to tell me that a new prescription from
   his oncologist—what amounted to his last line of defense against the
   cancer he had been battling for years—was beyond his reach financially.
   His previous treatment had worked far better for him than for the
   average patient with his condition, but its efficacy had dwindled
   during a long sabbatical from drug treatment, during which he underwent
   a major surgery. Now faced with either an old drug regimen that no
   longer worked or a prohibitively expensive new drug, his only realistic
   option, he told me, was to forgo further medication. In other words, he
   was prepared to die. I had a hard time accepting this. With his
   engineer's mind, my father had managed to navigate his way through the
   murky realms of conflicting treatments and doctors' opinions, keeping
   himself alive far beyond his original prognosis. At the time of his
   call to me, he was fit and strong, and his cancer—which had been
   stabilized by the previous treatments—was currently progressing at an
   almost imperceptible rate. Yet I knew what he probably did not: that
   his end from this particular disease would be, in the words of an
   oncologist friend, "one of the worst deaths possible." If there was any
   way around this, any way at all to spare or delay the suffering that
   lay ahead, I was prepared to try it.

   Two years later, and a few months after my father died, my mother took
   the train cross-country to visit me in California. Somewhere in
   Nebraska—in the course of a 10-hour Amtrak delay—Congress passed the
   Medicare drug bill. During the dreary wait for railroad repairs, a
   fellow passenger asked my mother what she thought of this bill. She
   didn't like it, she said, at which point the passenger confessed to
   being an employee of AARP, and added that the AARP employees didn't
   like it any better themselves. The consensus-of-two was that this was a
   welfare plan not for the elderly or the sick, but for the phenomenally
   healthy pharmaceutical industry.
    I knew that his end from this particular disease would be, in the
   words of an oncologist friend, "one of the worst deaths possible." If
   there was any way around this, I was prepared to try it.

   Somehow, in hearing my mother tell this story, the saga of my father's
   misadventures in the American health care system came full circle.
   Triggered by his call two years earlier, I had become something I had
   never imagined—a smuggler and a fraud—in pursuit of that which my
   father had never conceived of upon retirement 12 years earlier: a
   prescription costing so much that it would justify the purchase of an
   expensive supplemental drug-insurance plan. My family of immigrants,
   once eager for a piece of the buoyant American economy, found ourselves
   wondering if we would have fared better in virtually any other
   industrialized country on earth, where the impossible choice between
   bankrupting ourselves, breaking the law, or forgoing lifesaving
   treatments did not exist.

   "I don't know why Americans resent paying taxes," my father often said
   during my childhood. "They don't seem to understand that taxes provide
   them with things they need." By the end of his life, I think he
   resented taxes himself, perceiving that too much of the wages of the
   middle class was spent on corporate entitlement programs, including
   those aiding the $235 billion-a-year global pharmaceutical industry. By
   the time of his death, the business of prescription drugs had become
   the most profitable industry in America, with a staggering campaign war
   chest of $29.4 million in 2002—enough funds to employ in excess of 600
   lobbyists, more than one for every member of Congress, and enough power
   to make elections and legislation in its own image.

   The new drug my father's oncologist was prescribing for him was well
   known to me (for legal reasons, I will omit its name and the
   manufacturer's name), for it had a fearsome reputation from decades
   earlier. How expensive could this drug be, I wondered, when all the
   research and development had been done 40 years ago, at a fraction of
   the modern costs? A hell of a lot, was the answer. I still don't know
   why. But in my father's case, it was about $47,000 a year, with the
   potential to triple, based on his clinical response, to $141,000 a
   year. At this rate, in seven years, he could conceivably have spent a
   million dollars. Although he had profited from decades of employment in
   North America, he had not profited well enough to pay for that, and he
   was realistic enough about his medical future to resist becoming "spent
   out"—the current jargon for those who have anted up all in pursuit of
   staying alive—leaving him and my mother financially ruined (at which
   point, ironically, they would have been eligible for free drugs).

   Like millions of frustrated others, I turned to the Internet, hoping to
   find some way of acquiring what my father needed. There was a whole
   cadre of us out there, I learned, seeking drugs for ill parents, or
   spouses, or children. There were those looking, and those
   giving—including the survivors of the deceased, who were willing to
   pass along the remnants of no-longer-needed prescriptions. Like
   addicts, we identified ourselves by first name only, and our missives
   were sad and apologetic. "I am sorry," wrote a fellow sufferer, who had
   originally thought he could help me with my father's drug. "I looked
   everywhere I could think of and couldn't find any _____. It must have
   been thrown away or used, I guess. My dad tossed a ton of stuff. I
   think I was too disturbed by my mom's death to rigorously look through
   it at the time. I am very sorry."
   How expensive could this drug be, I wondered, when all the research and
   development had been done 40 years ago, at a fraction of the modern
   costs? Answer: $47,000 a year, with the potential to triple to
   $141,000.

   Upon my father's retirement in 1991, he automatically became covered by
   Medicare and chose to purchase supplemental AARP hospitalization
   insurance. He decided against the supplemental prescription-drug
   insurance because, as he later told me, he could not conceive of any
   drug costing enough to justify paying $2,400 a year for it. For me, one
   of the more painful aspects of our predicament was the fact that my
   father, a son of the Depression and of World War II, prided himself on
   always being prepared for the bleakest prospects the future might
   deliver. But not even his darkest imaginings could prepare him for the
   breathtaking ascent in the price of drugs—costing Americans $213.4
   billion in 2003—which he regarded as a personal failure of his
   preparedness skills.

   Because more than a third of Medicare patients have no
   prescription-drug benefits, Congress enacted the Medicare drug bill
   last December, at an estimated cost of $400 billion over the next
   decade. In the weeks following its passage, it became a matter of
   morbid curiosity to me to assess whether or not the new law would have
   solved my father's problems. If he had survived, here is what he might
   have looked forward to: After paying a $420 annual premium, plus a $250
   annual deductible, the government would have covered 75 percent of his
   prescription costs up to $2,250; he would then have been responsible
   for all payments up to $5,100, at which time the government's
   catastrophic aid would have kicked in, paying 95 percent of his drug
   expenses. So I estimate that he would have been responsible for $6,115
   of his $47,000 cancer drug. Would he have paid that much? I can't say
   for sure. Locked into a fixed income that was in decline along with the
   stock market, he might have decided against it.

   Generally speaking, if my father had been a very low-income senior, he
   might have fared better under the new plan, unless he lived in a state
   where Medicaid had been paying for prescriptions without charging him
   deductibles or premiums. If he had been a middle-income senior with
   modest drug costs, he would probably have fared no better and might
   have ended up paying more in annual premiums than his drugs cost. If
   his expenditures had fallen into the "doughnut hole," between $2,250
   and $5,100, he would have found little relief. Ironically, his
   worst-case scenario under the new plan would have been a complete
   reversal of what had been the best-case scenario, i.e., a retiree who
   still enjoys employer-paid health coverage. Such people were once the
   lucky few; but under the new legislation, all 3.8 million of them stand
   to lose that coverage entirely. And those whose new Medicare drug
   bene-fits will be provided via privately run programs could find
   themselves denied expen- sive drugs, say, ones that cost $47,000.

   So who will fare well? Doctors and hospitals will get a boost, because
   a scheduled cut in their Medicare payments has been eliminated. The
   insurance companies will receive new subsidies designed to encourage
   them to cover seniors and the disabled. But the really big winners will
   be the drug companies, who are estimated to see a 9 percent increase in
   sales, or $13 billion in additional profits per year.


   After a lot of fruitless trolling, my Internet searches eventually led
   me to a pharmaceutical company overseas that made the same drug my
   father needed under a different brand name for roughly $1,200 a
   year—absurdly cheaper than the $47,000 a year the American company was
   demanding (and roughly one-fifth what my father would have paid under
   the new Medicare bill). What would you do? Well, I did it too—and can
   now add drug smuggling to the dubious accomplishments on my résumé.

   My family was not alone. For years, patients with AIDS or cancer have
   been buying drugs from Mexico, either because these drugs are not
   available in the United States, or because they are available more
   cheaply south of the border. More recently, Americans have begun
   wandering north. The first organized busloads of drug-buying American
   seniors crossed into Canada in the mid-1990s, and currently, between 1
   and 2 million Americans of all ages buy Canadian drugs via the
   Internet. It's easy to see why. Cholesterol-lowering Lipitor costs $127
   in the United States, $60 in Canada; the anti-arthritis drug Celebrex
   costs $106 here, $41 there.

   Having spent much of my adult life traveling and working overseas, and
   having many personal contacts in foreign countries, I had the means to
   procure a doctor in the country that manufactured the drug, get a
   prescription, fill it at a pharmacy there, and bring it home. We had
   concerns, though. I worried that U.S. Customs, or even airport
   security, might ask what I was doing with so many foil-wrapped packets
   of pills. To offset this possibility, I opened all the packets and
   emptied their contents into prescription bottles I had brought along.
   Yet this solution raised another concern: the memory of a news story a
   few years ago about an American woman trapped in a hellhole of an
   overseas jail because she had prescription drugs in mismatched bottles.
   Luckily, when smuggling my father's prescription, no one ever stopped
   or questioned me, and aside from some sweaty moments feeling like a
   drug runner (and hoping I did not look like one), the process went
   smoothly. Over time I was also able to use non-American friends as
   coyotes to smuggle refills.

   Within a couple of months, my family's other concern—that the foreign
   drug would be ineffective—proved groundless. Scans showed my father's
   tumors, which had previously been advancing, were in retreat; his
   doctors were delighted with his response and even more tickled to learn
   how he had overcome the impossible limitations of the American health
   care system.
   My father's current supply of the drug was running out, and we didn't
   know if an interruption in treatment would enable the cancer to renew
   its attack. We split his daily dose in half, trying to eke out his
   supply. When the delay continued, we halved it again.

   A few months later I discovered that we might be able to import the
   drug quasi-legally into the country. "We have sent ______ to the USA
   many times," wrote my contact at the overseas pharmaceutical company.
   "We have contacted DHL and they advised that, if the doctor clearly
   specifies the doses in the prescription, they think there will be no
   problem in USA customs."

   Filled with optimism at reclaiming the status of law-abiding citizens,
   we sent off the money and the order. But the process took longer than
   anticipated. My father's current supply of the drug was running out,
   and we didn't know if an interruption in treatment would enable the
   cancer to renew its attack. We worried. As weeks passed and the
   shipment still had not arrived, we worried some more, and then split
   his daily dose in half, trying to eke out his supply. When the delay
   continued, we halved it again. Eventually, we heard from U.S. Customs
   that the package was being held by the Food and Drug Administration,
   which was not convinced of the legality of this import or of my
   father's need for this foreign drug. We provided a slew of hastily
   improvised reasons why this formula was better than the American
   formula, pointedly avoiding the only real reason—because the FDA had
   advised us it was not a valid one—which was that the foreign version
   was monumentally cheaper, and the only one we could afford. The FDA was
   not swayed.

   "We cannot vouch for the efficacy of this foreign drug," my FDA case
   officer told me, as I struggled to liberate my father's shipment. I
   said that I wasn't asking them to vouch for it, because I already knew
   that it worked, and would be happy to send my father's scans as proof.

   The FDA likes to cite the dangers of buying drugs from abroad (even
   drugs made in the United States and sold in Canada), and it is true
   that there's an alarming rise in counterfeit drugs—those made with fake
   ingredients or diluted doses of the real ingredients. But buying from
   American pharmacies is risky too. Recently, an AIDS patient in San
   Francisco discovered that his prescription for Serostim, bought through
   a CVS pharmacy, was actually a fertility drug. Last August, the FDA
   pulled 1.8 million doses of counterfeit Lipitor from American
   pharmacies, but not, it admits, before some was used. In December, Eli
   Lilly halted sales to five U.S. drug wholesalers after a counterfeit
   version of a drug (which Lilly would not name) was purchased. Also that
   month, federal agents seized some 1 million pills of counterfeit
   Celebrex, Bextra, and Allegra from a Florida warehouse.

   So are American drugs any safer than Canadian? To date, the FDA cannot
   name a single American who has been injured or killed by prescriptions
   bought from licensed Canadian pharmacies.

   Under the new Medicare drug bill, Americans are now expressly forbidden
   from importing U.S.-made drugs available more cheaply from overseas.
   Here's how it works: I can go to Europe and buy their wine for less or
   go to Asia and buy their clothes for less; American corporations can
   buy their raw materials for less from overseas, or they can move their
   operations abroad in order to hire cheaper labor or management. But in
   a mind-boggling reversal of the American principle of supply and
   demand, I cannot purchase cheaper drugs and bring them home.

   And try as I might, I cannot imagine who is benefiting from such laws
   other than the U.S. drug companies. The regulations did not protect my
   father—who was desperately seeking his next dose—and were conceivably
   killing him. When his supply finally ran dry, we tided him over with a
   diluted dose from the leftover prescription of a dead person. When the
   FDA threatened to destroy his shipment, I contacted my senators and my
   representative, asking for help. Dianne Feinstein's and Lynn Woolsey's
   people would not or could not give any. But Barbara Boxer's folks did,
   inspiringly, and within 48 hours of my request they had sprung my
   father's package from the clutches of the FDA, just in time for the
   Fourth of July.


   In another bizarre aspect of the new Medicare drug bill, Congress has
   forsworn its ability to negotiate lower drug prices—because this would
   amount to government price controls, say some lawmakers. Never mind
   that by purchasing in such gigantic quantities the government could
   bargain for a better price—one of the working tenets of capitalism.
   Never mind that it already does negotiate for lower prices through the
   Department of Veterans Affairs. As things currently stand, the costs of
   best-selling drugs in America are 77 percent higher than in Canada and
   Europe (where prices are tightly regulated), enabling the drug
   companies to milk 66 to 75 percent of their profits from American
   consumers, who in essence subsidize cheap pills for Canadians and
   Europeans. Yet despite this unwitting generosity, I cannot legally
   visit those countries and reimport what my subsidy sold them on the
   cheap in the first place.
   I can go to Europe and buy their wine for less or go to Asia and buy
   their clothes for less; American corporations can buy their raw
   materials for less from overseas, or they can move their operations
   abroad in order to hire cheaper labor or management. But in a
   mind-boggling reversal of the American principle of supply and demand,
   I cannot purchase cheaper drugs and bring them home.

   Defenders of this aspect of the bill claim that high prices are needed
   to counteract the enormous costs of research and development of new
   drugs, the much-touted $800 million-plus per new drug, spent over 10 to
   15 years of testing. But is this where the pharmaceutical industry
   really spends its profits—that 30 to 40 percent annual return on equity
   that has made it the most profitable business on earth three of the
   last five years? Apparently not. In 2002, the nine top publicly traded
   U.S. companies that market popular drugs to seniors spent $45.4 billion
   on advertising (restricted in Canada and Europe), on marketing
   (including billions' worth of free drug samples to physicians), and on
   administration. Meanwhile, they spent only $19.1 billion on R&D, much
   of which is on testing new uses (and thus new profit centers) for
   already approved drugs.

   The marketing blitz works. Americans currently buy more than twice the
   number of prescriptions as Europeans, and sales of the 50 most heavily
   advertised drugs jumped 24.6 percent between 1999 and 2000. To offset
   the costs of all this advertising, the drug companies now practice
   rampant price inflation in the United States, escalating the retail
   costs of drugs each year by more than three times that of actual
   inflation.

   Although the federal government appears unwilling to address this
   problem, some states are responding. In February 2003, New York sued
   GlaxoSmithKline, Pharmacia Corp., and Aventis for illegally inflating
   what the state and its Medicare recipients paid for prescription drugs
   through an elaborate pricing scam. Minnesota is currently suing the
   pharmaceutical companies (which state officials call "the other drug
   cartel"), because 85 percent of new drug R&D is performed by the
   National Institutes of Health and tax-funded university labs. Both
   suits are pending.

   Meanwhile, the costs of generic drugs, those once trusty alternatives,
   are rising nearly twice as fast as brand-name drugs, due in part to the
   consolidation of the generic-drug industry. So even thrifty patients
   are joining the ranks of the one-fifth of Americans who currently
   cannot afford what their doctors prescribe and are forced to skip
   doses, or entire prescriptions, in order to make ends meet.

   The pipeline for my father's drug worked well for the remainder of
   2002. But at the end of that year, a package foundered on the shores of
   the FDA, and not even Barbara Boxer's people could wrestle it free. The
   government was cracking down on imports, and although my contact
   officer at the FDA was sympathetic, she nixed the few remaining
   loopholes almost as soon as she thought them through. In the end, she
   suggested that I try the prescription-drug-assistance program of the
   U.S. pharmaceutical company that made the drug my father needed.

   We had already tried this—back in the beginning—following the advice of
   one of my father's doctors, who suggested that we need not be "entirely
   truthful" as to his financial situation on the application. So we lied,
   but only a little, and were rejected. Now, a year later, we would try
   again, and I was prepared to be utterly ruthless this time. It did not
   feel like stealing because, in all honesty, I didn't feel bad about
   milking a company so willing to do the same to us.

   When I queried a representative at the prescription-drug-assistance
   program as to whether my father needed to be indigent to be accepted,
   she said no, not indigent. Then, miraculously, she coughed up one small
   brilliant truth, which in the ensuing silence I knew she was already
   regretting. "We don't actually check anything you say on the
   application," she told me. It was like being given a key to the City of
   Health. We submitted the new application for my father, the
   almost-indigent, and were accepted. The new drugs began arriving free
   from our former $47,000-a-year nemesis.

   In retrospect, the whole process of getting this drug for my
   father—although difficult and painful—was easier for my family than it
   would be for many others. We were willing and financially able to
   travel overseas, to ask help of (or harass) our elected officials, to
   pour our collective energy into pioneering a solution. At the beginning
   of our search, my father had already spent his retirement years on what
   I estimate to be the equivalent of a full-time job managing his own
   health care—either researching it, administrating it, or undergoing it.
   I can't imagine this was what he had envisioned for his golden years,
   but he did the work stoically, employing the same problem-solving
   talents he had used as a private contractor on classified Defense
   projects for the U.S. government. But by the time his cancer drugs
   began arriving free of charge, his health was failing. In the last
   months of his life, he could no longer negotiate a phone call to
   wrangle with drug companies or government agencies. He could not have
   managed finding alternate sources of the drug. If he had been like
   millions of others without the strength to help themselves, or without
   resourceful helpers, he would have died earlier. As many must do.

   A couple of months after his free drugs arrived, my father entered the
   hospital for the last time. His drugs came with him and were
   administered until nearly the end. Amazingly, his prescription was
   still working, was still holding the cancer in check. The drug's
   initial promise had proved well worth all the subsequent troubles and
   anxieties, buying him another year of life at least, so that he did not
   die from his cancer, the worst possible death, as I had feared.
   Instead, his heart quit, possibly due to problems with other treatments
   attendant to his condition. Or maybe he was worried about the way his
   full-time job managing his health care had become ours. At any rate, he
   was tired. He let us go.

   Will the medicare drug bill help? Maybe. But I have absolutely no doubt
   that the smuggling will go on. The bus trips to Tijuana and Toronto
   will continue to deliver the desperate who have no alternative but to
   pay $14 for the Tamoxifen that would cost them $60 at home. The flights
   around the world to cheap pharmacies and drug companies will not
   disappear simply because the government will, beginning in 2006, pay 75
   percent of drug costs for seniors spending less than $2,250 a year.
   One-quarter of Americans under the age of 65 have no prescription-drug
   benefits whatsoever, and they will remain highly motivated to search
   elsewhere.
   I continue to get requests from the others out there with first names
   only who are looking for the same drug my father once used. I am more
   than happy to tell them what I know, how to work the system, how to
   break the law.

   Only when the prices of drugs fall into some compliance with the rest
   of the world will the black market subside. I wonder if the
   pharmaceutical giants ever calculate what would happen to their profits
   if they lowered their prices and wooed back all the lost consumers like
   my father who are fleeing to the far ends of the earth. Or if, by
   making drugs affordable, they might not attract all those who simply
   throw away their prescription slips because they cannot afford the
   drugs—or those who stagger their doses for the sake of economy.

   In response to the high prices, a few states and municipalities are
   beginning to flex their bargain-hunting muscles too. Springfield,
   Massachusetts, is reimporting drugs from Canada for its city employees.
   Burlington, Vermont, plans to follow. Boston announced it will do so
   for 7,000 employees and retirees, saving an estimated $1 million a
   year. New Hampshire plans to reimport for its prison population and
   Medicaid patients. Initially, the U.S. government seemed to take this
   trend in stride. But last December, when Illinois announced its plan to
   save $91 million by reimportation, Governor Blagojevich was warned by
   the feds that such a move would be illegal. "Our law is very specific,"
   said a government spokesperson. "It's not 'will not.' It's 'cannot.'"
   And drug companies are also being aggressive: GlaxoSmithKline warned
   Canadian pharmacies to stop selling to Americans or their supplies
   would be shut down.

   In the wake of this anarchy, a few in Congress are re-examining a bill
   sponsored by Rep. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota that would allow
   reimportation from FDA-approved facilities in 25 industrialized
   countries and employ technology to prevent counterfeiting. But if the
   pharmaceutical industry gets its way, such legislation will die—turning
   an increasing number of sick and desperate Americans into outlaws, or
   forcing them into early graves.

   Meanwhile, my contact information floats in cyberspace, and I continue
   to get requests from the others out there with first names only who are
   looking for the same drug my father once used. I am more than happy to
   tell them what I know, how to work the system, how to break the law.
   "Thanks so much!" one contact responded. "(And thank goodness for email
   and the wonderful network of caring people such as you.) This is
   terrific information! Until the FDA comes to its senses, it seems that
   those overseas are truly our friends."

   Others write to me of their struggles when the loved ones they fought
   so hard to save die. "My mom was very religious, so I read the Bible.
   But sometimes nothing seems to help. My mom was a kind of optimistic,
   cheerful type person. So it is going to be hard to find something to
   compensate for that, as well as her caring and love for me. I mean, you
   don't find that anywhere else in the world."

   No, you don't. And that's why the pipeline won't close until the cheap
   drugs come home again.

Top Labour donor calls for MPs to quit party

   Lucy Fisher and Francis Elliott
   Published at 12:05AM, September 17 2015

   One of Labour’s biggest donors has vowed to fund MPs who want to defect
   from the party as he branded Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership the “beginning
   of the end”. Assem Allam, the multimillionaire owner of Hull City
   football club, said that he would financially support moderate figures
   prepared to launch a centrist party or defect to the Liberal Democrats.
   The Egyptian-born tycoon, who has donated £720,000 to Labour since
   2010, had already dismissed the party as a “dead horse” and said that
   he would no longer contribute money. John Mills, Labour’s biggest
   individual donor, has also vowed to stop funding the central party but
   Mr Allam is the first major donor to urge moderate MPs to defect. His
   intervention came on another difficult day for the new hard-left party
   leader in which: · Mr Corbyn did a U-turn after refusing to sing the
   national anthem at a Battle of Britain service. Labour aides confirmed
   that he would sing it at all official events. “I love my country,” he
   told Channel 4 News. · He warned his shadow cabinet to recognise his
   mandate amid growing divisions over welfare, economic policy, Britain’s
   nuclear deterrent and Europe. · The first detailed poll since his
   election showed that only 17 per cent of voters believe he is likely to
   become prime minister and less than half of Labour voters trust him on
   the economy. · Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned
   that Mr Corbyn’s plans for “people

Judges at war over privacy in divorce cases

   Liam Gallagher arrives with his legal team, including Fiona Shackleton,
   at the Central Family Court

   Their daily work is deciding multimillion-pound disputes between
   divorcing couples. Now, two senior family court judges in England and
   Wales are themselves at loggerheads. Mr Justice Holman and Mr Justice
   Mostyn, who both sit in the High Court family division hearing complex
   and often bitter divorce battles, are at odds over how much the public
   should be told about those involved in such fights. There is a pressing
   need, according to Mr Justice Holman, for more openness, but his
   colleague Mr Justice Mostyn argues that such disputes are
   “quintessentially private business”. The spat came to light as Mr
   Justice Mostyn, whose own divorce in 2011 received unwelcome publicity,
   was hearing a dispute over the division of assets between the rock
   singer Liam Gallagher and his former wife Nicole Appleton. Openness in
   the family courts — historically accused of sec

Welby in talks to stop a church split

   The Archbishop of Canterbury has invited the 37 heads of the worldwide
   church to crisis talks in a desperate attempt to avoid a permanent
   schism. The Most Rev Justin Welby will propose that Anglican
   communities with differing views loosen their links. Many have refused
   to speak directly to each other for more than a decade, but he will try
   to persuade them not to break away altogether. Faced with the biggest
   crisis in the church since Darwin developed his theory of evolution,
   the archbishop intends to offer each of the churches “wiggle room” to
   hold different positions on issues such as gay marriage, sources say.
   They could sever links with churches holding different views as long as
   they keep a basic connection with the “mother church in Canterbury”.
   The archbishop believes that he could then maintain relations with the
   liberal churches of North Ameri

Could heart drugs treat HIV?

   Cholesterol-lowering statins may provide an alternative to
   antiretrovirals.

   A study of six AIDS patients has revealed that statins can reduce
   levels of HIV and boost immune cell numbers. If the results can be
   repeated in large-scale trials, it's hoped that statins could provide
   an alternative to standard HIV treatments.

   Statins are taken by millions of people to lower cholesterol levels and
   help protect against heart disease. And studies have shown that
   cultured cells with low levels of cholesterol in their membranes are
   less likely to succumb to HIV infection.

   So, Carlos Martínez from the Spanish Council for Scientific Research
   and colleagues decided to study the effects of cholesterol-lowering
   statin drugs on HIV patients. Their results are reported in the Journal
   of Experimental Medicine^1.

   A one-month course of statin treatment caused the virus levels of human
   patients to drop by up to 20-fold. Levels began to rise when patients
   stopped taking the drug.

   When mice, injected with HIV-infected human cells, were given the
   drugs, their virus levels fell, in some cases to undetectable levels.

   Together, these results suggest that statins may prove useful against
   HIV in human patients, says Martínez.

Killer virus

   HIV suppresses the immune system by infecting and killing the cells of
   which it consists. Martínez believes that statins prevent the virus
   from entering healthy cells in the first place.

   It is hoped that the drugs could offer an alternative to the standard
   AIDS treatment, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This
   therapy is becoming less effective as drug-resistant HIV strains
   continue to emerge.

   Resistant strains have limited the options for many HIV-infected
   patients, explains HIV researcher Eric Freed of the HIV Drug Resistance
   Program at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland. "This
   makes the development of alternative treatments especially urgent."

   Statins could also prove safer than antiretrovirals. HAART can trigger
   serious side-effects, such as liver damage, but statins are relatively
   free of such problems.

   Martínez hopes that statins could also be used preventatively. His
   study shows that white blood cells taken from patients on statins are
   less likely to succumb to HIV infection.

   Larger clinical trials should be forthcoming, says Martínez. But he
   cautions that such studies are difficult to set up. It is hard to find
   HIV-positive patients who are not already taking anti-HIV medication,
   he points out. One solution may be to concentrate on patients who have
   already become resistant to the standard treatments.

     * The polio time bomb

   Millions of Australians were given a polio vaccine infected with
   remnants of a cancer-causing virus. Scientists knew the dangers but
   released the vaccine anyway, writes Gary Hughes.

   The eight scientists gathered in the meeting room at the Commonwealth
   Serum Laboratories in Melbourne included the key researchers who had
   helped turn the tide in the fight against polio in Australia.

   But the mood was far from celebratory as the meeting started on May 1,
   1962. The team responsible for developing and producing the local
   version of the Salk polio vaccine in 1956, which had been given to
   millions of Australians during the following years, was faced with a
   crisis.

   Four days earlier CSL biochemist John Withell had completed laboratory
   tests that confirmed what had been feared: the latest batch of polio
   vaccine was contaminated with a newly discovered virus that came from
   monkey kidneys used to produce it.

   The virus had been designated SV40 - the 40th simian virus that had
   been identified - but this virus, first discovered by British
   researchers the previous year, was different. Tests in the United
   States had shown it could cause aggressive cancers in small animals and
   was not killed in the normal process used to manufacture polio vaccine.

   In the words of Withell, who went on to become head of the government's
   Therapeutic Goods Administration laboratories in Canberra, SV40 "was
   recognised straight away as a fairly nasty virus".

   Those at the meeting were confronted with the dilemma of what to do.
   The discovery of SV40 contamination could not have come at a worse time
   for the government-run CSL. The laboratories, which carried out
   virtually all vaccine research and production in Australia, had just
   undergone one of the most turbulent periods in its history, with
   mounting political pressure over delays in producing the polio vaccine,
   the removal of its director, management upheavals and rising costs.

   While the introduction of Salk vaccine in Australia in 1956 had blunted
   the threat of polio, outbreaks had continued: in Victoria, Tasmania and
   South Australia in 1960-61 and in Queensland and NSW in 1961-62.

   The spectre of poliomyelitis, which could lead to death or permanent
   paralysis, was still enough to cause widespread public panic, in turn
   pressuring politicians and health authorities.

   In 1961 state health authorities and health ministers were pressing
   Canberra to provide increased amounts of the vaccine amid a growing
   shortage caused by production problems at the laboratories. Two entire
   batches of vaccine, representing about 1.4 million individual doses,
   had been destroyed in November 1961 because they had failed safety
   tests. The release of other batches had been delayed because
   independent tests showed the vaccine still contained live polio virus,
   forcing it to be reprocessed.

   The pressure was showing among senior staff, with some worried about
   standards being compromised.

   In September 1961, batch 58 was issued despite a written warning from
   the laboratories' senior medical consultant that "it does not meet
   CSL's accepted standards in potency and is a long way short of the
   increased potency approved by the National Health and Medical Research
   Council".

   In August 1961, senior researcher John Graydon wrote a memo saying
   important decisions on the release of vaccine that failed safety tests
   were being influenced by the supply situation. Effectiveness and
   safety, he said "should be the determining criteria".

   The shortages, production problems and the continuing demand - by 1961
   fewer than half the population had been vaccinated - had led
   authorities to secretly buy polio vaccine from overseas manufacturers.

   CSL was no stranger to the lurking simian viruses, which contaminated
   vaccines through the kidneys of monkeys imported from Asia by the
   hundreds. The monkey's kidneys were removed and pulped to make cell
   cultures in which the polio virus was grown before being killed and
   turned into vaccine.

   The laboratories' production records in the National Archives show the
   presence of a simian virus disrupted safety tests of finished vaccine
   in 1957. In 1958 a batch of finished vaccine was destroyed after a live
   "non-polio virus" was detected. That same year a virus "consistent with
   its being a simian virus" was found in another batch. Simian viruses
   along with other factors such as stress were also causing the
   laboratories' imported monkeys to "die like flies" at Melbourne Zoo
   where they were kept, according to Withell.

   Scientists at the serum laboratories were first warned about SV40
   contamination of Salk polio vaccine and its potential threat in April
   1961 by the US Department of Health, after the monkey virus had been
   found to have survived the process used to kill live polio viruses used
   during American vaccine production.

   The US authorities said they had found SV40 in half of the samples it
   had tested from its own vaccines and urged other manufacturers around
   the world that "every effort should be made to institute a program of
   testing each lot of vaccine to ensure that vaccine reaching the market
   is free of simian agents". The Americans also adopted the policy of not
   releasing any new batches of vaccine until its had been shown to be
   free of SV40.

   CSL received a first-hand account of the problem in November 1961 when
   one of its most senior researchers, Allan Duxbury, visited America's
   Biological Standards Laboratory. In a three-page report sent back to
   Melbourne, Duxbury said the "most interesting" part of his visit was
   the study of SV40 and the fact it had been shown to cause malignant
   tumours in hamsters "unlike any previously produced by other viruses".

   But according to CSL records, the first testing of local vaccines had
   not started until February 1962, which eventually led to confirmation
   in April that batch 64 was contaminated.

   Now a decision had to be made by the laboratories' new director, Ron
   Greville, on how to cope with this new threat and further potential
   embarrassment. According to the notes of the meeting held at CSL on May
   1, 1962: "Dr Greville opened the discussion by stating that although
   SV40 virus was present in batch 64, the batch would be issued; a
   decision which was founded on the belief that probably much vaccine in
   the past was probably similarly contaminated."

   Greville went on the say "every effort" should be made to produce
   vaccine free of SV40 "as soon as practicable".

   One of those working on polio vaccine production at the laboratories at
   the time was Dr Alan Hampson, now the deputy director of the World
   Health Organisation centre for influenza research, based at CSL. "I
   would not be at liberty to discuss what might have been found in
   vaccines issued by CSL," he said this week.

   The man who found SV40 in CSL's vaccines, John Withell, reviewed his
   original research workbooks for this story after they were found in the
   National Archives. Withell, 72, was surprised at how few samples there
   were of previously released batches of polio vaccine available for
   testing for SV40. Records show that the samples retained for safety
   testing were frequently combined to produce new batches of vaccine to
   overcome shortages.

   "I know I certainly went back to look at old batches of polio vaccine
   which had been kept in storage, but I think there were only a very
   small number," he recalls.

   His original workbooks show he tested three earlier batches, No.49 that
   was released in October 1959, No.58 released in September 1961 and
   No.63 released February 1962. The tests results show SV40 was found in
   batches 49 and 63. He also found the virus in vaccine batch 65, which
   was released in January 1963, and batch 66.

   Each batch of vaccine represented about 700,000 individual doses of
   Salk vaccine. Withell says it was likely that other batches of vaccine
   produced before 1962, which were not available for testing, were also
   contaminated.

   It was not until batch 66 that, on instructions from federal health
   authorities, the laboratories treated the vaccine to kill the living
   SV40 virus it contained. The process, however, also destroyed the
   effectiveness of the vaccine and it had to be destroyed.

   Withell also tested the "seed" polio viruses used to make each batch of
   vaccine. The vaccines contained three kinds of polio viruses, which
   were killed using formaldehyde to provide immunity. The type two polio
   seed virus was "stuffed full" of SV40, Withell said. Although the other
   two types of polio virus were negative, the effectiveness of the
   testing method cast doubt on those results.

   Withell has also told for the first time of how he experimented for CSL
   in an attempt to establish whether SV40 could cause cancer in humans.

   He and another researcher infected cells taken from human embryos with
   the monkey virus and recorded how the cells were "transformed", or
   became cancerous.

   But the results of the research, done in late 1962 while the
   contaminated doses of vaccine batch 64 were being prepared for release,
   were never made public. Withell said he handed the results to a
   committee overseeing research within the serum laboratories and heard
   nothing more.

   Not everyone at the laboratories was in favour of releasing polio
   vaccine contaminated with SV40. Withell and several other younger
   scientists were not only concerned at the cancer threat the living
   monkey virus posed, but also with the risks from vaccine where SV40 had
   been killed.

   The young scientists feared that DNA from the SV40 virus alone could
   trigger cancers. Some 35 years later their fears began to appear well
   founded when SV40 DNA turned up in human cancers. Withell says there
   was heated debate about the releasing of contaminated vaccine within a
   CSL virus advisory committee set up to study the issue.

   "There was an argument about whether or not we should have a position
   on releasing vaccine in which we knew there was dead SV40," Withell
   says. "I was strongly of the opinion that it shouldn't be released,
   because even if the SV40 had been killed, it still had the SV40 DNA.
   There were concerns that DNA might be sufficient to have a carcinogenic
   effect in the recipient of the vaccine.

   "We actually had a vote on that and I proposed we shouldn't. That was
   carried, but I was never quite clear what happened to the batches
   involved. As far as I can tell, that virus committee never met again. I
   was always amused about that. I left [CSL] shortly after that."

           [black.gif]

Conservancy faces elimination by state

   By Terry Rodgers
   UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER

   August 21, 2004

   Supporters of the San Diego River Conservancy, which has been targeted
   for elimination by Gov. Schwarzenegger's government-efficiency
   commission, turned up at a public hearing yesterday to plead their
   case.

   "We believe it's OK to streamline the bureaucracy, but not at the
   expense of democracy," San Diego City Councilwoman Donna Frye said
   yesterday at the University of California San Diego.

   Frye was the only member of a group of eight environmentalists allowed
   to testify at the public hearing held by the California Performance
   Review Commission. The others who showed up were told they would have
   to attend another of the commission's statewide hearings.

   Frye, vice chairwoman of the conservancy's board, said the tiny state
   agency – the only employee is its executive director – is user-friendly
   and encourages public participation.

   "The taxpayers are getting a bargain when you factor in private
   donations and hundreds of volunteer hours that go into this coalition
   that works closely with the conservancy," Frye said in an interview.

   Although the staffs of the state's eight conservancies are supported by
   state general funds, the agencies use voter-approved bond funds to
   acquire lands for habitat protection and public access.

   San Diego's conservancy was created in September 2002 by the
   Legislature to foster the creation of a 52-mile-long system of trails
   and parks along the length of the San Diego River.

   The commission, in its Aug. 3 report to the governor, recommended
   eliminating state funding for five of the state's eight conservancies,
   including San Diego's, because they "do not represent land assets of
   statewide interest that benefit all Californians." The Coastal
   Conservancy, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Lake Tahoe
   Conservancy would be untouched.

   The report suggests that the de-funded conservancies could regroup as
   joint-powers authorities, local government consortiums created for a
   single purpose.

   Reducing the conservancies would save the state an an estimated $2.1
   million annually, the report says.

   In an interview, San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy, who serves as chairman of
   the river conservancy, said the commission's assessment of the
   conservancy is incorrect.

   "The San Diego River is a resource of statewide significance," he said.
   "It's the location of California's first mission, its first water
   project and a home to two dozen endangered species."

   Most experts agree that a state-chartered conservancy is a more
   efficient decision-making body than a joint-powers authority, Murphy
   said.

   "We are just on the threshold of beginning to make a difference," he
   said. "I intend to join with Vice Chair Donna Frye and all the friends
   of the San Diego River to fight this ill-conceived proposal."

   The current conservancy is run by an 11-member board of directors who
   do not draw salaries. Five volunteer members are eligible to be paid
   $100 a meeting.

   By contracts, a joint-powers authority would have to include a
   multitude of local agencies with jurisdiction over the river's
   watershed, including the county, five cities, water districts, three
   state parks and a national forest.

   Michael Beck, chairman of the San Diego River Park Foundation, one of
   53 nongovernmental groups supporting the river revitalization effort,
   said a conservancy has more direct access to state bond funding than a
   joint-powers authority.

   "The differences are monumental," Beck said.

   Upon its creation, the San Diego River Conservancy was entitled to $12
   million in state bond funding for land acquisition and planning. About
   $7.8 million remains unspent.

   Jane's midlife roller coaster
   By Marilyn Elias, USA TODAY
   Compared with many adults hit by bipolar disorder, Jane Pauley got off
   lightly with a rare midlife diagnosis and rapid symptom relief after
   three weeks in a top-notch hospital, say experts reacting to Pauley's
   disclosure of the illness in her autobiography.

   [pauley-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] Jane Pauley, diagnosed withbipolar
   disorder, begins her talk show Aug. 30. [clear.gif]
   By Todd Plitt, USA TODAY

   The respected TV news personality was diagnosed at age 50 in March
   2001, according to the book, Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue, which
   hits bookstores on Tuesday. An account of her ordeal with bipolar
   (manic depression) was detailed in a book excerpt in People magazine,
   which came out Friday. The diagnosis came less than a year after
   steroid treatment for hives had set off a cascade of mood changes.

   The disease usually surfaces in the late teens or 20s, but about 10%
   have a first episode in the 50s, says psychiatrist Lori Altshuler,
   director of the Mood Disorders Clinic at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric
   Institute.

   Pauley, 53, says the steroids cured her hives, but "revved" her up.
   After she stopped taking the drugs, hives recurred. When a second
   course of steroids left her depressed, doctors put her on an
   antidepressant. But that triggered mania that led to her
   hospitalization. Pauley's doctor said she had an unsuspected
   vulnerability to bipolar disorder, and antidepressants can "unmask" the
   disease in people at high risk.

   It all makes sense, says Frederick Goodwin, a George Washington
   University psychiatrist and co-author of the main textbook on bipolar
   disorder.

   Steroids are the right treatment for a bad case of hives, but they also
   can wreak havoc with moods, especially in those at risk for
   manic-depression. It's also well known that antidepressants can spur
   dangerous mood swings in patients with undiagnosed bipolar disease.
   "She had a twofer," Goodwin says.

   Manic-depression is partly, but not entirely genetic. If one identical
   twin has it, his twin stands a 60% to 90% chance of getting the
   illness, say psychiatrist Paul Keck, a specialist in bipolar disorder
   at University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Those diagnosed in
   middle age, such as Pauley, are less likely to have a family history of
   the disease and more likely to get set off by medicines or a stroke,
   Altshuler adds. More than 2 million Americans have the disorder.

   Pauley's descriptions of her mood shifts and hospital time are
   surprisingly tranquil. Despite the grave concern of husband Garry
   Trudeau and her doctor, she didn't feel very ill. "A lot of my patients
   minimize the severity, and when you're manic, you don't remember how
   out of control you were," Altshuler says. "People aren't hospitalized
   for three weeks unless there's a severe problem."

   Pauley says lithium has stabilized her moods. But she'll need
   medication for the rest of her life, doctors emphasize. About 15% to
   19% of manic-depressives kill themselves, "usually because they're not
   in treatment," Keck says. "That's akin to the death rate from many
   forms of cancer."

   Study: Chocolate improves vessel health
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) — There's more good news for chocolate lovers.
   Scientists have found that eating dark chocolate appears to improve the
   function of important cells lining the wall of blood vessels for at
   least three hours.

   By Carolyn Kaster, AP

   The study, involving 17 healthy young volunteers who agreed to eat a
   bar of dark chocolate and then get an ultrasound, found that eating
   dark chocolate seemed to make the blood vessels more flexible, which
   helps prevent the hardening of the arteries that leads to heart
   attacks.

   But experts cautioned that the weight gain from eating a lot of
   chocolate probably would cancel out the apparent benefit.

   Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, which act as natural antioxidants
   — chemicals that combat the damage oxygen does to the body. However,
   that does not mean that chocolate binges will ward off a heart attack,
   experts warn.

   Cacao, the plant that chocolate comes from, has for centuries been used
   for everything from medicine to currency. Although enjoyed worldwide,
   until recently it was considered a treat that provided fat and calories
   but no substantial nutritional value.

   Studies recently have indicated that it releases the happy chemical
   seratonin in the brain.

   However, during the last few years, studies have suggested — much to
   the delight of chocoholics — that it is rich in flavonoids.

   The latest study, conducted by cardiologists at Athens Medical School
   in Greece, set out to test whether chocolate affected the functioning
   of the so-called endothelial cells in the walls of the blood vessels,
   which are believed to be affected by oxygen damage and are considered a
   mirror of the overall health of the cardiovascular system.

   The scientists, who presented their work Sunday at Europe's most
   important cardiology conference, gave 3.5 ounces of either dark,
   bittersweet, chocolate or fake chocolate to 17 healthy volunteers.

   On another day, the volunteers were switched. They had no chocolate
   outside of the study, and investigators did not know what each
   volunteer ate during the study.

   An ultrasound was taken of each volunteer's upper arm to see the
   functioning of the endothelial cells in the main artery. The cells
   accomplish their goal of controlling the stiffness of the blood vessel
   by secreting several active substances that regulate the flexibility of
   the vessel and influence clot formation.

   "During the chocolate session, endothelial function was improved,
   whereas during the placebo day there were no such changes," the study
   concluded. "The favorable effects of dark chocolate lasted for three
   hours at least."

   By improving the blood vessel flexibility in apparently healthy people,
   dark chocolate emerges as perhaps a power food, the scientists said.

   "At this time, we do not know whether regular intake of dark chocolate
   or other cocoa beverages could result in a reduction of total
   cardiovascular" problems or death, the study said.

   Experts warned against gorging on chocolate as a way to ward off heart
   trouble, reminding that excess calories lead to weight gain, which is a
   powerful trigger of heart problems. Any benefit to blood vessel
   flexibility would probably be wiped out by the danger of the weight
   gain, they advised.

   Also, while antioxidants in theory help keep the heart healthy and
   looked promising in early research, recent rigorous studies
   investigating whether antioxidant pills such as vitamins A, C and E
   ward off heart attacks have shown them to be useless.

   Dr. Michael Gibson, associate chief of cardiology at Harvard
   University-linked Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, said the chocolate
   study was "interesting."

   "There are a few basic science reasons why this might be good, but keep
   in mind that antioxidants also improved forearm blood flow but that
   didn't necessarily pan out as an effective treatment," said Gibson, who
   was not associated with the study.

   Upon examination, 'Medical Investigation' is a good show
   By Robert Bianco, USA TODAY
   You wouldn't mind the networks doing so many cop shows if they weren't
   all doing the same cop show.
   [clear.gif]

   NBC

   Granted, the problem-solvers in NBC's Medical Investigation (a new
   series getting a special post-Apprentice premiere Thursday, then moving
   to its regular slot Friday at 10 ET/PT) are doctors, not forensic
   detectives. And true, the problems they're tackling are medical, not
   criminal. But don't let the change in the frame obscure the big
   picture: This is "CSI: MI," from the interaction between the male lead
   and his subordinate female co-star to the visual tricks used to
   re-create the "crime."

   So take points off from Medical Investigation for such blatant copying.
   Then, TV being a relative business, add points back for copying well,
   taking the CSI template and using it effectively to turn medicine into
   a guess-what-happens-next mystery. (Related video: Neil McDonough and
   Kelli Williams walk and talk)

   Finally, give MI extra credit for its best idea of all: bringing
   Boomtown star Neal McDonough back to series TV. With the aid of a
   strong supporting cast, McDonough gives this copy an original edge,
   tension and clear-eyed drive it might otherwise lack.

   McDonough is Dr. Stephen Connor, the obsessively dedicated head of an
   NIH mobile medical team. We know he's obsessive because he's willing to
   disappoint his son by flying off in the middle of the kid's baseball
   game, though you have to wonder what kid wouldn't think it was kind of
   cool to see his game called on account of a military chopper landing in
   the outfield.

   Stephen is off to New York to find out why people are turning blue on
   the streets.

   "Your guess is as good as mine," the local M.D. says. "No," Stephen
   answers, "my guess is better" — the kind of masculine challenge line
   McDonough was born to pull off.

   Once there, he's joined by his team: Kelli Williams, liberated from The
   Practice and quite enjoyable as his second-in-command; Anna Belknap as
   the overly eager press liaison; and Troy Winbush as a medical
   inspector.

   Happily, MI has also found a place on the team for Christopher Gorham,
   the bright young star of UPN's near-miss Jake 2.0. This is TV copying
   the success of the old studio system: exposing an actor through guest
   shots and small roles, testing him with the lead in a small-studio "B"
   movie, and then giving him a major role in a major project. Keep
   watching Gorham. He could someday carry his own NBC show.

   All right, I could do without the genre's seemingly requisite visual
   trick. (As Stephen imagines what might have happened, his thoughts come
   to life as ghosts around him, causing a perplexed bystander to ask,
   "Are you talking to me, your phone or your imaginary friends?") And I
   hope every case won't reflect in some way on the doctors' personal
   lives — the kind of mirror-image storytelling ER has already done to
   death.

   Copy one show at a time, please. We have enough trouble keeping up as
   it is.

   Health costs rising faster than incomes, study says
   By William M. Welch, USA TODAY
   WASHINGTON — Health insurance premiums paid by U.S. workers have risen
   nearly three times faster than average earnings in the past four years,
   eroding the income of average Americans, a study based on federal data
   shows.
   [clear.gif]
   [medical-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] More Americans are spending a major
   portion of their annual incomes on health care. [clear.gif]
   By Brian Branch-Price, AP

   Premium costs for private health insurance coverage grew 35.9% from
   2000 to 2004. Average individual earnings grew 12.4%, the study found.
   Those findings are similar to those of other non-partisan groups, such
   as the Kaiser Family Foundation, and government agencies, including the
   Commerce Department.

   As health premiums consume a growing share of earnings, more Americans
   are spending a major portion of their annual incomes on health care.
   During the same four-year period, the number of Americans whose health
   care costs exceed one-fourth of their earnings rose to 14.3 million
   from 11.6 million, the study being released today concludes.

   The findings are from an analysis conducted by the Lewin Group, a
   private health economics consulting firm, for Families USA, a
   consumer-oriented health advocacy group that has supported Democratic
   presidential candidate John Kerry's health care proposals.

   Lewin used its computer economic models of the U.S. health care system
   to analyze data from the Census Bureau, the Labor Department and
   federal health care agencies.

   The study was conducted in an attempt to pose and answer a version of
   President Reagan's memorable 1980 campaign question: Are you better off
   now than four years ago? The findings are certain to be used by
   Democrats to argue that average Americans have fallen behind
   economically under President Bush's administration and that any
   benefits Bush's tax cuts delivered to working families have been lost.

   "These grim findings explain why health care costs and coverage have
   become a top-priority concern for America's families over the past four
   years," the Families USA report says.

   Key points made by the study:

   • In 26 states, workers' premium costs rose by more than 40%. The
   average premium amount paid by workers for family coverage rose from
   $1,433 to $1,947.

   • The share of health premiums paid by employers also rose, but at a
   slightly smaller rate, 31.8%. The share of employer-paid premiums for
   family coverage went from $5,595 to $7,373.

   The findings come as no surprise to millions of Americans and their
   employers; they document a trend of rising costs and shrinking
   benefits. In an attempt to control premiums for themselves and their
   workers, some companies have increased co-payments and scaled back
   benefits.

   In an attempt to cut costs, some companies plan to levy surcharges next
   year on workers who sign up for family benefits when their spouse was
   eligible for health coverage through a separate job.

   Those increased premiums and co-payments have contributed to a rising
   number of Americans confronting what economists call catastrophic
   health care costs.

   Of the 14.3 million Americans younger than 65 whose health care costs
   totaled more than one-quarter of their earnings in 2004, the study
   found, a majority of those had health insurance coverage. The number of
   insured Americans facing health care costs in excess of 25% of their
   earnings rose from 8.4 million to 10.7 million during the period, it
   said.

   The report said overall increases in health care costs, including
   payments to hospitals and doctors and the cost of prescription drugs,
   are the main forces driving the rise in private insurance premiums. But
   it said the rising number of Americans without health insurance is a
   contributing factor, because costs of treating the uninsured that are
   not covered by government programs are passed along to others.

   Court: Limbaugh records properly seized
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla (AP) — A state appeals court ruled Wednesday that
   Rush Limbaugh's medical records were properly seized by investigators
   seeking information on alleged illegal drug use.

   Investigators raided the offices of Limbaugh's doctors seeking
   information on whether the conservative commentator illegally tried to
   buy prescription painkillers. Limbaugh, 53, has not been charged with a
   crime and the investigation had been at a standstill pending a decision
   on the medical records.

   "We hold that the constitutional right of privacy in medical records is
   not implicated by the State's seizure and review of medical records
   under a valid search warrant without prior notice or hearing," the 4th
   District Court of Appeal ruled. Chief Judge Gary M. Farmer wrote the
   opinion.

   A spokesman for Limbaugh did not have any immediate comment.

   Prosecutors went after Limbaugh's medical records after learning that
   he received about 2,000 painkillers, prescribed by four doctors in six
   months, at a pharmacy near his Palm Beach mansion.

   Limbaugh admitted his addiction to pain medication in October, saying
   it stemmed from severe back pain. He took a five-week leave from his
   afternoon radio show to enter a rehabilitation program.

   Two prescriptions for health insurance crisis
   By William M. Welch, USA TODAY
   President Bush and Sen. John Kerry are promoting very different plans
   for improving the nation's troubled health care system, either of which
   could dramatically change how millions of Americans get health
   insurance — or whether they have coverage at all.

   Both presidential candidates tout proposals that have crowd appeal.
   Bush promises to give Americans more control over their health care and
   end big malpractice awards. Kerry promises new health insurance
   coverage for millions who lack it, as well as lower prescription-drug
   prices through Canadian pharmacies.

   Each also uses Americans' concerns about health care — its availability
   and cost — as a weapon to attack the other. Kerry says the president's
   health policies ensure more profits for big drug companies and health
   insurance companies, and little benefit for working Americans. Bush
   says Kerry's plan would bring a "government takeover" of health care;
   he likens it to the Clinton administration's failed attempt at
   universal health coverage a decade ago.

   Their pointed rhetoric reflects even deeper disagreement about the
   future course of health care in the USA. Beyond the charges and
   countercharges, the two candidates would take the nation's health care
   system in strikingly different directions.

   Though his opponent likes to depict him as a liberal, Kerry actually is
   offering the more conservative of the two proposals — in concept, if
   not in dollars. He wants to build on private, employer-provided health
   insurance as well as the public Medicare and Medicaid systems for
   seniors, the poor and disabled, and working Americans who can't afford
   insurance on their own.

   Bush would steer the nation's health care system in a different
   direction. He wants more Americans to shop for their insurance coverage
   or medical services, reasoning that if they are more attuned to the
   costs, market forces will limit health care inflation.

   The difference is fundamental, says Drew Altman, president and CEO of
   the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit think tank focused
   on improving health care in the USA.

   "We're not just witnessing the traditional differences between
   Republicans and Democrats," Altman says. "The president really is
   proposing at least the beginnings of a very different approach that
   focuses on the individual and moves away from employer-based and
   government programs."

   Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the first
   Bush administration and is an adviser to President Bush's re-election
   campaign, agrees the dispute represents a philosophical disagreement.

   "There really is a fundamental difference," she says. "Do we think
   Medicaid and government programs are the response for people who are
   not poor?"

   Learning from the Clinton debacle

   Bush blasts Kerry's plan as akin to President Clinton's failed national
   health insurance plan of 1994. "He's got a system that's creeping
   toward Hillary-care," Bush said recently in Ohio.

   But many health policy analysts and economists say that's hardly the
   case. Clinton's plan mandated that employers offer insurance to
   workers; Kerry doesn't require any coverage but offers subsidies to
   encourage employers to offer it. "They seemed to learn the lessons of
   the Clinton plan and not overregulate," says Jeff Lemieux, an economist
   with America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry group.

   The two candidates differ in the scope and ambition of their proposals.
   Kerry's is far more expensive. But even conservative analysts say it
   would provide coverage to far more people than Bush's proposal.

   Bush's plan includes tax breaks to encourage Americans to purchase
   coverage or set aside savings to pay their own medical bills. He
   estimates it would cost $145 billion over the next decade while
   extending coverage to 11 million people. A study of the two plans by
   the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, estimates
   that Bush's plan would extend insurance coverage to fewer than 7
   million people.

   Kerry estimates his plan would cost $650 billion over 10 years while
   providing coverage to 27 million Americans. The same conservative study
   agreed with that number but estimated that it would cost more than
   twice the amount Kerry advertises.

   Driving concerns about health care: rising costs and growing numbers of
   Americans without insurance.

   Costs have been rising at double-digit rates, fueled by new
   technologies and treatments, new prescription drugs, and ever-growing
   demands for care by Americans. The number of people without insurance
   has been growing inexorably as well and totaled 45 million when
   measured in 2003.

   Some estimate the number of Americans who have gone without insurance
   at some point in the last two years tops 80 million, or one in every
   three Americans under 65.

   Those 65 and older get coverage through Medicare, the federal health
   system. But they are confronting growing costs in co-payments,
   uncovered items and premiums that are due to rise 17% next year, the
   largest increase ever.

   Both Bush and Kerry would need congressional approval of their plans
   before they could become law — no easy task. Kerry says his proposals
   would be paid for by rolling back tax cuts enacted under Bush's first
   term for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year.

   Bush also proposes limits on medical-malpractice lawsuits. "I'll tell
   you another way to help small businesses afford health care: It's to do
   something about these junk lawsuits that are running up the cost of
   medicine," he says. Kerry says limits may be needed for some
   specialists who face problems getting liability insurance. But he
   argues that limiting liability will do little to hold down medical
   inflation. "Yes, it's a problem. Do we need to fix it, particularly for
   Ob-Gyns and for brain surgeons and others? Yes. But it's less than 1%
   of the total cost of health care," Kerry says.

                   Comparing the candidates on health care

   George W. Bush John Kerry
   Covering the uninsured Wants to encourage individuals to purchase
   health coverage or pay for own health costs through tax credits and
   tax-favored health savings accounts. Plan is based on assumption that
   they will be more cost-conscious if encouraged to shop for their own
   insurance or medical treatment. Wants to expand coverage through
   employer-provided insurance and government programs for those without
   private insurance. Proposes expanding government programs to cover most
   children and working-poor adults. All Americans would be eligible to
   buy coverage from a range of plans available to members of Congress.
   Medicare reform Signed into law a broad Medicare bill in December 2003
   after winning his proposal in Congress. It creates in 2006 the first
   benefit for prescription drugs for seniors. It also provides big
   financial incentives to HMOs to offer health coverage to seniors
   through Medicare, as well as increased payments to doctors for Medicare
   services. Did not vote on final Senate passage of the Medicare law but
   opposed it on preceding votes. Argued that the benefit was too limited
   and complicated, and that the plan was an attempt to drive seniors out
   of traditional Medicare and into HMOs and other forms of managed care
   by providing large subsidies to private insurers. Said it needed
   provisions to control costs and provide greater protections for
   low-income Americans.
   Drugs from Canada Opposes making it legal for Americans to import
   cheaper prescription drugs from Canada unless U.S. health officials
   determine the drugs are safe.

   Has voted to allow reimportation of drugs from Canada as a way to
   reduce prescription-drug costs.
   Patients' rights As governor of Texas, opposed legislation imposing
   regulations on HMOs and other managed-care plans and opening them to
   malpractice lawsuits by patients injured or denied care. Later allowed
   such a bill to become law without his signature. As president, directed
   his administration to argue against such state laws before the U.S.
   Supreme Court. Fought against legislation that would have opened HMOs
   to lawsuits by patients in state courts. Voted for patients' rights
   legislation that would allow individuals to sue HMOs and collect
   punitive damages for denial of care or poor care. Says he would seek
   passage of a Patients Bill of Rights as president.
   In the candidates' words "We will offer a tax credit to encourage small
   businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and
   provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These
   accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness,
   the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the
   freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you
   change jobs."

   - From his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention,
   Sept. 2, 2004
   "When I'm president, America will stop being the only advanced nation
   which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the
   wealthy, the connected, and the elected. It is a right for all
   Americans."

   Bush criticizes Kerry on health care, medical liability as moving

   DOWNINGTOWN, Pa. – President Bush criticized Sen. John Kerry's plans
   for health care and medical liability reform on Thursday, saying the
   result would be even higher costs and more federal involvement.

   "The Kerry plan would move America down the road toward federal control
   of health care," Bush told hundreds of supporters in an area outside
   Philadelphia that he won by 18,000 votes four years ago. Some recent
   polls show Kerry with a slight advantage in Pennsylvania.

   Kerry's prescription for health care is "bigger government with higher
   costs," Bush said, a claim that the Democrat's campaign says is false.

   The number of uninsured Americans increased by 5 million over the past
   four years and the government announced last month that Medicare
   premiums will increase in January by a record amount in dollar terms of
   $11.60 per month.

   Bush said medical decisions should be made by doctors and patients.
   However, the Medicare law he signed will, by the administration's own
   estimate, move roughly 9 million more people into Medicare HMOs and
   other managed care plans.

   On the issue of lawsuits against doctors, the president said Kerry has
   voted 10 times in his Senate career against reforms in the area of
   medical liability.

   "The effects of the litigation culture are real in Pennsylvania ...
   medical malpractice premiums are soaring," Bush said.

   The Bush campaign says limiting medical malpractice awards could save
   $60 billion to $108 billion annually in health care costs. The Kerry
   campaign rejects Bush's numbers and favors limits on medical
   malpractice premium increases, sanctions for frivolous lawsuits, and
   nonbinding mediation in all states.

   Kerry says more than half the states already cap non-economic damages
   in medical malpractice cases.

   Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, told reporters at a news
   conference coinciding with Bush's visit that the president is raising
   the malpractice issue to distract attention from increasing numbers of
   people losing health care coverage and the rising costs of coverage.

   "This is a typical response by the president's campaign, taking a
   problem that exists but is on its way to being solved by other people
   and blowing it up in an effort to scare the voters," Rendell said.

   Closely mirroring national trends, the segment of people in
   Pennsylvania without health insurance rose in the first part of this
   decade. In the three years ending in 2003, about 10.7 percent of
   Pennsylvanians were uninsured, up from a decade low of 8.3 percent in
   the three years ending in 2000.

   Bush lost Pennsylvania to Democrat Al Gore in 2000 by 205,000 votes.

   Study: Taste sensitivity may be linked to lower weight
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Could a sensitive palate be the key to a svelte
   figure?
   [clear.gif]
   [taste-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] The Rutgers study found that less
   sensitive tasters tended to like fattier, sweeter, hotter and more
   bitter foods. [clear.gif]
   Brian Branch-Price, AP

   Maybe, say researchers at Rutgers University and elsewhere who have
   found people especially sensitive to bitter compounds in broccoli and
   other foods tend to be thinner than others.

   A new Rutgers study, on nearly 50 women in their 40s, found "super
   tasters," people most sensitive to bitter tastes, were 20% thinner than
   "nontasters," those not sensitive to bitter tastes.

   "People who are nontasters tend to like foods that are fattier,
   sweeter, hotter and more bitter," said Beverly Tepper, a professor of
   food science at Rutgers.

   "They tend to eat more fatty foods," she said. "What we believe is that
   if nontasters pursue this kind of dietary pattern over time that this
   would lead to higher body weight."

   Super tasters instead appear to eat less food overall — be it high-fat
   foods or healthy, bitter vegetables, according to preliminary research.

   Tepper's study, which awaits publication, found super tasters had an
   average body-mass index of 23.5. Medium tasters had an average of 26.6,
   and nontasters an average of nearly 30.

   Body-mass index measures weight relative to height. A BMI of 25 and
   above is considered overweight; 30 and higher is obese.

   Tepper's study is small, but it's her fourth with similar findings,
   including one involving New Jersey preschoolers. That research found
   the nontaster kids preferred full-fat to low-fat milk and ate more
   added fats such as butter and salad dressing than the other children.

   Tepper said the strongest association she's found has been in
   middle-aged women. She said about 50% of Americans are medium tasters
   and 25% each are super tasters or nontasters.

   Those classifications are actually based on sensitivity to a chemical,
   known as PROP for short, that is very similar to compounds that make
   foods like broccoli and brussels sprouts taste bitter. Some scientists
   dispute the association between sensitivity to PROP and body size, but
   researchers at Yale University and University of Connecticut have
   produced results similar to Tepper's.

   Laurie Lucchina, a former researcher and instructor at both schools who
   now does research for Gillette Co.'s oral care division, repeatedly
   tested taste and smell sensitivity of elderly women. "We found people
   who could taste PROP as more bitter were significantly thinner," she
   said.

   She said super tasters generally perceive sweet, sour and salty tastes
   — not just bitter ones — more intensely than others.

   Valerie Duffy, who teaches nutrition and dietetics at Connecticut, has
   produced similar findings and also shown that super tasters, compared
   with others, generally have more papillae, the tiny bumps on the tongue
   that hold taste buds. She said some research shows an association
   between eating habits and gene variations related to ability to taste
   bitter compounds.

   Duffy said another scientist reported nearly four decades ago that
   people extremely sensitive to the bitter tastes of PROP tended to be
   lean, while nontasters were built like football players.

   Little further research was done until the 1990s. Now numerous studies
   are investigating the connection.

   Still, some researchers haven't found the link between PROP and body
   size, including Richard Mattes, professor of foods and nutrition at
   Purdue University.

   "I am a great skeptic of the role of PROP in food intake and body
   mass," he said, partly because people sensitive to the chemical may not
   be turned off by bitter compounds in foods such as chocolate and
   coffee, where milk or other sweet flavors mask the taste.

   Tepper, Lucchina and Duffy say they believe Mattes' findings differ
   from theirs because he uses different methods to classify subjects'
   taste perception.

   USA in a fragile state of health, report says

   If the USA were a patient, according to the public health doctors who
   today unveil results equivalent to a nationwide annual physical exam,

   [07-newborn-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] A state-by-state analysis shows
   slow progress in infant mortality and obesity. [clear.gif]
   By Bob Brown, Richmond Times-Dispatch/AP

   After 15 years of significant improvements, progress has stalled. And
   two key areas in particular — obesity and infant mortality — are
   playing havoc with the country's vital signs.

   A state-by-state analysis of indicators, from how many adults smoke to
   what percentage of tax dollars go toward health, reveals that the
   healthy strides are slowing dramatically. (Related: State health
   rankings and successes)

   In the 1990s, the annual report called America's Health: State Health
   Rankings documented improvements of 1.5% a year. Driven partly by
   smoking-reduction programs, the nation became 17% healthier since 1990,
   and every state improved. But since 2000, the improvements leveled off,
   rising only 0.2% each year.

   "What is most concerning to us is the slowdown of the improvement we
   had in the early 1990s," says Georges Benjamin of the American Public
   Health Association, a study sponsor.

   The growth in the prevalence of obesity — which is up 97% since 1990 —
   threatens the nation's future health, he says. Nearly 23% of the
   population has a body mass index (a number that incorporates height and
   weight) of 30 or higher, which is 30 or more pounds over a healthy
   weight. This raises the risks of chronic diseases that afflict the
   overweight.

   "We know what is on the horizon," Benjamin says.

   But while the effect of excess weight is largely still to come, the
   infant mortality rate is a trauma being felt now. More than 75 infants
   die each day across the USA, according to data from the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention. The doctors behind the new study say
   the deaths are a sad reminder that the nation is not as healthy as it
   can be.

   "Have we gone as far as we can go? Have we reached the limits of what
   human beings can achieve?" asks Reed Tuckson of United Health
   Foundation, a non-profit health advocacy group. "When we compare our
   infant mortality rate against other nations, it lets us know that we
   have much more distance to travel."

   On average, seven of every 1,000 American babies die before age 1. The
   USA ranks 29th in the world in infant mortality.

   The rate is directly related to mothers having access to both prenatal
   and pediatric care. But it also tells officials that other maternal
   risk factors lurk, including age, obesity, smoking, infection and
   stress.

   The state health rankings are calculated using 18 measures ranging from
   high school graduation rates and violent crime statistics to cancer and
   motor vehicle accident deaths.

   The healthiest states and their percentage above the national norm:
   Minnesota, 25%; New Hampshire, 23.9%; Vermont, 22.8%; Hawaii, 17.7%;
   and Utah, 17.6%.

   The least healthy and their percentage below the national norm:
   Arkansas, -12.1%; South Carolina, -12.9%; Tennessee, -13.1%;
   Mississippi, -20.2%; and Louisiana, -21.3%.

   "Really poor states, like Louisiana and Mississippi, have fewer
   resources with which to work," Tuckson says.

   The report says that along with rising rates of obesity and higher
   infant mortality rates, these three community problems are slowing
   health progress across the nation:

   • Higher percentage of people without health insurance.

   • Declining high school graduation rates.

   • Increased child poverty.

   "Today, everybody has an interest in talking about health," Benjamin
   says. "But in some quarters there is more talk than action."

   Sleep loss may equal weight gain
   By Nanci Hellmich, USA TODAY
   Too little sleep can make you fat.

   [inside-sleepweight2.jpg] [clear.gif] Snooze and learn: Researcher Eve
   Van Cauter shows a sleep-study room at the University of Chicago.
   [clear.gif]
   By John Zich, USA TODAY

   That's the conclusion of some groundbreaking research, including two
   new studies released Monday.

   Scientists have found that sleep deprivation increases levels of a
   hunger hormone and decreases levels of a hormone that makes you feel
   full. The effects may lead to overeating and weight gain.

   It could explain why so many Americans who are chronically
   sleep-deprived also are overweight. And it could be part of the reason
   sleepy college students, new parents and shift workers pack on pounds.

   Researchers say getting enough shut-eye might be a critical component
   of weight control. And nutritionists one day might routinely advise
   dieters to "sleep it off" as well as to cut calories and increase
   exercise.

   "We know the obesity epidemic is due to overeating — too big portions,
   too much rich food and too little activity — but why do we crave too
   much of these rich foods?" says Eve Van Cauter, a University of Chicago
   sleep researcher who is the lead investigator on one of the new
   studies. Maybe, she says, it's because "we are sleep-deprived and
   unable to curb our appetites."

   Sleep does indeed appear to be an important piece of the weight-control
   puzzle, says Stanford University sleep researcher Emmanuel Mignot, who
   also is releasing new research.

   If that's true, it might be part of the solution to the nation's
   obesity problem. Sixty-five percent of Americans are overweight or
   obese, which increases their risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
   cancer and other diseases.

   This percentage takes on a special significance when balanced against
   the fact that an estimated 63% of American adults do not get the
   recommended eight hours of sleep a night, according to the National
   Sleep Foundation. In fact, the average adult gets 6.9 hours of sleep on
   weeknights and 7.5 hours on weekends, for a daily average of seven
   hours.

   Van Cauter has spent 25 years doing research on the hormones that are
   affected by sleep. She says sleep deprivation activates a small part of
   the hypothalamus, the region of the brain that also is involved in
   appetite regulation. She is especially intrigued by, and has done
   several studies on, two critical hormones involved in regulating food
   intake: ghrelin and leptin.
   [clear.gif]  How much is enough? [clear.gif] [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]
   Sleep needs vary, but in general most adults need seven to nine hours a
   night, experts say. There are some people who can do with less, and
   others who need more.
   Yet, many people don't know exactly how much sleep they need.
   Sleep researcher Eve Van Cauter, professor of medicine at the
   University of Chicago, recommends trying to get a handle on your sleep
   need by doing this:
   The next time you're on vacation, sleep as much as you can the first
   couple of days. That way you can pay off your sleep debt, she says.
   Then, when your sleep has stabilized, record how much you sleep, plus
   or minus 15 minutes.
   That is your sleep need or capacity.

   They influence eating in different ways. Ghrelin is an
   appetite-stimulating hormone released mostly by the stomach. When
   ghrelin levels are up, people feel hungry, Van Cauter says. On the
   other hand, leptin, considered a satiety or fullness hormone, is
   released by the fat cells and tells the brain about the current energy
   balance of the body.

   When leptin levels are high, that sends a message to the brain that the
   body has enough food, and the person feels full, she says. Low levels
   indicate starvation and increase appetite.

   The hormones "have been called the yin and yang of hunger," Van Cauter
   says. "One is the accelerator for eating (ghrelin), and the other is
   the brake (leptin)."

   Hungry for sleep — and food

   Van Cauter, who directs the Research Laboratory on Sleep, Chronobiology
   and Neuroendocrinology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine,
   examined the effect of sleep deprivation on these two hormones for her
   latest study, published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine. She had
   12 healthy, normal-weight men, average age 22, come into a hospital
   laboratory to sleep, and eat dinner and breakfast.

   On one occasion, they were limited to four hours in bed for each of two
   consecutive nights. At another time, they were allowed up to 10 hours
   in bed for two nights. Their blood was drawn at regular intervals, and
   they were asked about their hunger. Findings:

   • Leptin levels were 18% lower and ghrelin levels were 28% higher after
   they slept four hours.

   • The sleep-deprived men who had the biggest hormonal changes also said
   they felt the most hungry and craved carbohydrate-rich foods, including
   cakes, candy, ice cream, pasta and bread. Those who had the smallest
   changes reported being the least hungry.

   Matt Tierney, 23, who is studying biology at DePaul University in
   Chicago, participated in the study. He says that after getting only
   four hours of sleep for two straight nights, he was so hungry he could
   have "eaten my pillow." He had no problems with hunger after the longer
   nights of sleep.

   Link found to body mass index

   Other research released Monday had similar findings. Scientists at the
   University of Wisconsin and Stanford University tracked 1,024 people
   ages 30 to 60. Participants from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study took
   sleep tests and blood tests every four years and reported their sleep
   habits.

   Findings:

   • People who routinely slept five hours a night had a 14.9% higher
   level of ghrelin and a 15.5% lower level of leptin than those who slept
   eight hours.

   • Those who regularly slept less than 7.7 hours had a slightly higher
   body mass index (BMI).

   "It's amazing how much people's sleep is reflected in the hormones in
   their blood," says Mignot, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute
   investigator at Stanford. His work is reported in today's online issue
   of the Public Library of Science Medicine.

   Several epidemiological studies show the same connection, including one
   out last month from Columbia University in New York that used
   government data on 6,115 people to compare sleep patterns and obesity.

   Researchers found that people who sleep two to four hours a night are
   73% more likely to be obese than those who get seven to nine hours.
   Those who get five or more hours of sleep a night are 50% more likely
   to be obese than normal sleepers. Those who sleep six hours are 23%
   more likely to be obese.

   And, the researchers reported, those who get 10 or more hours are 11%
   less likely to be obese.

   In a way, the latest findings seem counterintuitive "because most
   people think that sleeping too much contributes to making people fat,
   but we found the opposite is true," Mignot says.

   He believes that sleep-deprived people eat more because they're
   hungrier, they're awake longer and may be tempted by foods everywhere
   they go. They often consume far more calories than they burn in the
   extra hours they're awake.

   People are usually pretty sedentary in that extra waking time ——
   watching TV, reading, responding to e-mail, Van Cauter says. They may
   burn an extra 50 calories or so in several hours, but the changes in
   hormones prompt them to eat far more than 50 calories.

   "We believe the changes in appetite regulation are way in excess of the
   calories needed for the extra hours of wakefulness. We are testing this
   rigorously in the laboratory now," she says.

   Sleep may ease holiday stress

   Obesity experts are intrigued by these findings. "We've known that
   people use food as a pick-me-up when they are tired, but now it appears
   they are hungrier than we realized, and there is a hormonal basis for
   their eating," says Thomas Wadden, director of the Weight and Eating
   Disorders Program at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

   "The one thing that is clear is that during the holidays people should
   sleep as much as they can and not get too stressed out. That could
   prevent some of the holiday weight gain."

   Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington
   University School of Medicine in St. Louis, says it looks as if "we
   should tell overweight patients to get more sleep. This is advice
   that's easier to follow than eat less and exercise more. "

   "It means watching a little less TV at night and getting to bed
   earlier," Klein says. "Who on earth would argue about getting more
   sleep?"

   Getting enough sleep and controlling stress are subtle things that
   could have an impact on weight, agrees Louis Aronne, president of the
   North American Association for the Study of Obesity and director of the
   Comprehensive Weight Control Program at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

   Other studies are underway. Van Cauter is looking at how sleep loss
   affects people on low-calorie diets; how shift workers' sleep habits
   affect their weight; and how sleep affects the hunger levels of the
   morbidly obese. She's also investigating sleep deprivation in women and
   older people.

   Mignot says researchers now must to do an intervention study in which
   sleep-deprived people increase their sleep time to see if it helps them
   lose weight.

   "More and more we're realizing that healthy eating, healthy sleeping
   and regular exercise are three important things that everyone should
   do," he says.

   Van Cauter believes that some people might be extra-sensitive to sleep
   deprivation, which "makes it very hard" for them to control their
   appetites.

   "Our body is not wired for sleep deprivation," she says. "The human
   animal is the only one that does this."

   [t.gif] Advocates for abandoned babies win lottery millions
           [black.gif]

   ASSOCIATED PRESS

   5:17 a.m. December 7, 2004

                                                         [041207lotto.jpg]

   Steven, left, and Debi Cifelli look at each other after winning the the
        California SuperLotto Plus jackpot, worth $27 million in Calimesa.

   CALIMESA – The latest winners of the California SuperLotto Plus jackpot
   say they haven't thought about what they'll buy for themselves, but
   they do know what they'll do for newborn babies.

   Debi Faris-Cifelli and her husband Steve, who provide funerals for dead
   abandoned babies and helped inspire a California law to save unwanted
   newborns, won the jackpot worth $27 million on Wednesday night. They
   plan to take their winnings in a lump sum and will get a little less
   than $9 million after taxes in a check that should be issued within
   several weeks, lottery officials said.

   The couple said they would use their winnings to continue their
   advocacy work, possibly by starting a college scholarship fund with
   awards given in the names of the 70 abandoned babies Faris-Cifelli has
   buried at the Garden of Angels cemetery she started in Calimesa.

   "We can do some good with the money," Steve Cifelli, a high school
   guidance counselor, told KABC-TV on Monday. "Because we believe in
   helping people, and now we're going to be able to do some things
   that'll last lifetimes, generations."

   Debi Faris-Cifelli lobbied strongly for a state law passed in 2001 that
   allows mothers to leave their unwanted newborns at hospitals and other
   designated sites without fear of criminal prosecution.

   She plans to put some money into increasing education and publicity of
   the "safe haven" law.

   Faris-Cifelli, a former stay-at-home mom who now runs Garden of Angels
   as a nonprofit full-time, said she hasn't yet thought about what the
   couple would buy for themselves.

   "The first thing we started thinking about was, what can we do to keep
   this money helping others," she said.

   The couple spent $20 to buy their winning ticket in their home of
   Yucaipa. It was only the third time they had played the lottery
   together since getting married several years ago.

Living Well: Natural childbirth advocate speaks out

   When Penny Simkin was pregnant with children during the 1960s, her
   physician suggested she would make an excellent candidate for natural
   childbirth.

   That was four decades ago, but that doctor apparently was way ahead of
   his time.

   Make that way, way ahead.

   A late November government report that C-section births rose for the
   seventh straight year doesn't much endorse natural or unmedicated
   childbirth. More than 27 percent of all babies born in the U.S. last
   year were delivered by Caesarean, said the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention.

   These statistics both sadden and motivate Simkin. A natural childbirth
   didn't work out with her first child due to complications. But Simkin's
   next two kids were delivered without medications. She was thrilled by
   the natural experiences.

   By the time she was expecting her fourth child, Simkin had changed
   doctors and went along with his conventional suggestion to medicate her
   during the birth. It was a sort of let's-use-the-latest-technology
   persuasive argument. Simkin regrets the decision to this day.

   Nonetheless, Simkin put her convictions to good work.

   In 1968, looking for part-time work, she began teaching childbirth
   classes especially focused on natural deliveries. Her four birth
   experiences make good classroom material.

   "I have the full range of experiences," she said.

   Simkin said her goal is to "make sure women are informed." She wants
   expectant mothers to consider all of their delivery options, including
   how to make decisions about such matters as a C-section or epidurals at
   critical junctions of delivery.

   What strikes Simkin is there was more openness about midwifery and
   natural childbirth -- especially avoiding drugs and unnecessary
   C-sections -- during, say, the 1980s than now.

   Geoffrey M. Anderson, a professor of health policy at University of
   Toronto, wrote recently in the British Medical Journal that how women
   view labor and delivery appears to have changed from "demedicalization
   common in the early 1980s to the increased demand for the use of
   medical technology found in today's world." Anderson was commenting on
   a study showing elective Caesarean sections are increasing worldwide.

   The World Health Organization suggests a reasonable Caesarean figure in
   any given year is 15 percent. The CDC study didn't separate out
   medically necessary Caesareans from elective Caesareans.

   "Seattle is still a good place to have a baby (compared to many
   cities), but doctors and hospitals are less favorable to natural
   childbirth here and everywhere," Simkin said.

   One reason is the threat of malpractice suits from a natural childbirth
   that goes wrong. Some hospitals even have policies that women who
   deliver a first baby by Caesearan must have C-sections for any
   subsequent babies because vaginal deliveries following C-section births
   have increased risk factors.

   Anderson said the relationship between doctors and patients has
   changed.

   "The historical role of the doctor acting as the informed agent for the
   patient may be changing, thanks to the increasing reliance on a model
   where the patient is seen as the consumer and the doctor as supplier of
   services," he wrote. "Suppliers may find it difficult to ignore
   consumers' demands. Patients' preferences have an important role in
   informed decisions, but these preferences can be expressed fairly only
   in the context of the best evidence on risks and benefits, and doctors
   should not be expected to provide services that are of no clinical
   benefit or potentially harmful."

   Simkin, a trained physical therapist, estimates she has prepared more
   than 8,000 local women, couples and siblings for natural childbirth --
   or as natural as possible keeping both mother and baby safe. She has
   assisted hundreds of women and couples as a doula.

   She can't keep count of how many mothers and couples have thanked her
   over the years for teaching them the particulars of natural childbirth.

   Along with her class schedule (visit www.pennysimkin.com), Simkin has
   developed a video that covers what she calls the "3 R's" of natural
   childbirth.

   "Some women cope well with the pain and stress of labor, others are
   overwhelmed," said Simkin. "The women who do well have the '3 R's'
   characteristics."

   The first "R" is the ability to relax during and between contractions
   in early labor. Simkin said as labor progresses many women do better by
   not relaxing during contractions, feeling better if they move or
   vocalize, maybe even tensing up parts of their bodies. But Simkin said
   it is "vital" that women relax or be calm between contractions during
   childbirth.

   The second "R" is finding a rhythm as it relates to coping style.

   The final "R" refers to finding and using rituals that occur during
   contractions. Simkin said her students have discovered personal rituals
   such as rocking in a chair with patterned breathing, having a partner
   brush hair rhythmically during contractions or asking a partner to rub
   the expectant mother's lower leg lightly up and down in time with
   breathing. One mother who rowed crew in high school imagined each
   contraction as a smooth glide through the water, imagining each breath
   as a stroke of the oar.

   Simkin doesn't shun birth technology but wants it placed in proper
   perspective.

   "The idea is to provide information and natural options for mothers
   during birth," she said. "I want to help them make decisions for
   themselves."

Bishop Acts to Keep the Flu From the Flock

   BRATTLEBORO, Vt., Nov. 25 - When it came time for the communion
   offering during Thanksgiving Mass at St. Michael's Roman Catholic
   Church here, the Rev. Stanley Deresienski blessed the sacramental bread
   and wine on the altar, preparing it for distribution among the 40 or so
   congregants.

   But the wine never touched the parishioners' lips, for in the war
   against the flu here, not even the sacred is spared.

   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington is the only one in the country
   that has formally asked priests to refrain from using the communion
   chalice and parishioners to avoid the usual handshake, hug or kiss when
   they make the sign of peace during Mass until the end of flu season,
   the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops says. Other dioceses
   are taking precautionary measures, like encouraging hand-washing,
   requesting that sick people refrain from taking communion and
   encouraging those uncomfortable with shaking hands not to do so, a
   spokesman for the conference said.

   "Let's give one another a flu-free sign of peace," Father Deresienski
   said from the altar on Thursday morning. With the exception of a few
   spouses pecking each other on the cheek, parishioners waved and smiled
   at one another.

   Bishop Kenneth Angell requested the guidelines in late October, after
   Vermont officials said that the state was short 50,000 doses of flu
   vaccine. Officials of the diocese said a few parishioners called its
   headquarters, concerned that contact during Mass would make them
   susceptible to the flu. After discussing it with diocesan officials,
   Bishop Angell, 74, issued the edict. The ban began Oct. 31 and will end
   on Easter Sunday, March 27, 2005. There are 130 churches and about
   148,000 parishioners in the diocese.

   Diocesan officials say parishioners are generally pleased with the
   request, although some are disappointed that they are not able to
   complete communion or fully convey their peace offerings.

   "The bishop didn't want to make people feel out of place if they did
   not want to offer their hand. And we're concerned that if a good flu
   epidemic is going, it would be very hard to deal with," said Gloria
   Gibson, director of communications for the diocese. "I think a lot of
   people are afraid of the cup and holding hands for prayer or shaking
   for the sign of peace because people are in there sneezing."

   The ban mirrors one that government and church officials in Ontario
   enacted in the spring of 2003 at the height of the SARS outbreak in
   Canada, after 29 people in a Catholic prayer group contracted the
   disease.

   Dr. Arnold S. Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of
   Michigan, said there was no evidence that the ban would actually stop
   transmission of the flu. Sitting in a pew with a sick person for an
   hour is probably riskier than the kind of contact covered by the edict,
   Dr. Monto said.

   "In terms of the chalice, there is little evidence or no evidence that
   this is transmitted such as hepatitis A in terms of oral transmission,"
   he said. "In terms of the kiss of peace, then you're getting close to
   somebody who may be sneezing or coughing or dripping, and that's where
   the virus is. It's hard to say don't follow, but there's very little
   evidence that it's going to have a large effect."

   Ms. Gibson said that what the diocese has issued is only a
   recommendation, and some priests and parishioners are grappling with
   whether to alter church habits for what might amount to minimal
   prevention.

   The Rev. Skip Baltz, pastor of St. Mary's Parish in Williston, is
   allowing parishioners to sip from the chalice. He has not heard
   anything from the diocese. "These people, they're grown-ups, and
   they're also people of great faith. This is an option for them, as it
   was before the flu. People who partake in the chalice do so or don't do
   so as they see the nature of the Eucharist," Father Baltz said. About
   15 percent of parishioners have been drinking from the chalice since
   the edict was issued, he added, roughly the same percentage as before.

   Father Deresienski said he planned to explore the possibility of having
   two services, one with a chalice and one without.

   Some parishioners, including Ann Marie Ford of St. Mary's, say that
   they believe they are more likely to get the flu somewhere else, if at
   all, and that a dose of faith is the most potent vaccine.

   "It's part of my life," Ms. Ford said of the Eucharist. "If I'm going
   to get the flu, I'm going to get it, and I don't think it necessarily
   comes from the chalice."

   But others are embracing the ban. No one wants to drink from a cup
   after someone who is visibly sick or shake hands with such a person,
   said Nancy Campbell, 76, of Brattleboro, who gave up her flu shot this
   year so a sick person could have it.

   "I think it's a good idea," Ms. Campbell said. "People cough in their
   hands and shake hands with you and that's not O.K., especially during
   flu season."

   Louise May, the youth minister at St. Thomas Parish in Underhill
   Center, said the recommendations made the sign of peace an awkward
   dance. At first people instinctively extended their hands, she said,
   only to quickly recoil and look down in embarrassment. But she said
   people wanted to be protected. "There's science and the germ theory,
   and there's also our faith that asks us to believe and extend ourselves
   to others," Ms. May said. "I believe what the bishop did is the safest.
   God doesn't discount the germ theory. It seems like a reasonable thing
   to do."

Governor halts Newton execution

Perry halts execution

   Gov. Rick Perry halted the execution of Frances Newton today, one day
   after the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that the punishment
   be delayed for 120 days.

   Perry's action came about two hours before Newton, 39, was scheduled to
   die by lethal injection for the murders of her husband and two
   children.

   "After a lengthy review of the trial transcript, appellate court
   rulings and clemency proceedings, I see no evidence of innocence,"
   Perry said in a statement.

   "However, I am granting the additional time to allow the courts the
   opportunity to order a retesting of gunpowder residue on the skirt the
   defendant wore at the time of the murders and of the gun used in the
   murders. Although this evidence was evaluated by the jury and appellate
   courts, new technology is available for testing gunpowder residue.

   "Justice delayed in this case is not justice denied," Perry said. "The
   courts are the ultimate arbiters of evidence, and this case is now back
   in the hands of the courts."

   The parole board recommended the stay to allow Newton's attorneys to
   retest evidence and gather more information about her claims that she
   received poor legal counsel at her trial. Newton would have been the
   third woman to be executed in Texas since 1863.

   Houston Mayor Bill White also had asked the governor to delay the
   execution.

   Reprieve recommendations have been rare in recent years. The board
   considered 51 petitions between 2001 and 2003, but did not call for any
   reprieves.

   In May, Perry permitted the execution of mentally ill murderer Kelsey
   Patterson, rejecting a clemency recommendation from the parole board.

   Newton was convicted of capital murder in 1988 for the slayings the
   year before of her husband, Adrian Newton, 23, and the couple's
   children, Alton, 7, and Farrah Elaine, 21 months, in the family's
   northwest Harris County apartment.

   Prosecutors said Newton killed her family to claim $100,000 in life
   insurance money.

   Newton claims innocence. She speculates that a drug dealer she knew
   only as Charlie killed her family because her husband owed him money.

   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest appellate
   court for criminal cases, dismissed her appeal Monday by a vote of 5-4.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected her claim
   Tuesday, 3-0.

   Newton was prepared to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court if
   Perry did not accept the board's recommendation for a stay.

   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 5-1 to recommend that
   Perry delay her execution 120 days after she filed a petition for
   clemency last week. The petition raised questions about ballistics
   tests by the Houston Police Department crime lab, which has faced
   criticism in recent years for providing unreliable evidence in some
   investigations.

   Her attorneys also claim that there are other problems with the
   investigation and argue that they were not properly investigated
   because her trial attorney, Ron Mock, was ineffective.

   In a 5-1 vote Tuesday, the board agreed that she should be given time
   so her attorneys could investigate her possible innocence, retest
   evidence and better determine if she had poor legal representation.

   In April 1987, Newton and her cousin returned home from shopping to
   find her husband and their two children dead. They called police
   immediately. Her cousin said Newton was surprised and distraught.

   When sheriff's deputies arrived, they found Adrian on the couch, shot
   in the head. They found the couple's children in their beds, each shot
   in the chest. Police initially had no suspects, but Newton was arrested
   two weeks after the killings.

   Yet, hours after the slayings, tests on Newton's hands showed that she
   had not recently fired a gun, according to the petition filed by
   defense attorneys David Dow and John LaGrappe. Blood stains were found
   in several places in the Newtons' apartment, but none was found on
   Frances Newton's clothing.

   Court records show that tests found traces of possible gunpowder on the
   dress Newton wore, but her attorneys say that may have been garden
   manure, which, like gunpowder, has nitrates and can trigger a false
   positive test result. Initial tests on Newton's hands on the night of
   the crime found no evidence that she had fired a gun, court records
   show.

   A .25-caliber handgun, the murder weapon, was found in an abandoned
   house nearby and Newton's cousin testified she had seen Newton put it
   there sometime after the killings.

   Newton explained that she had found the unfamiliar gun at home and
   removed it as a safety precaution. Her husband sometimes carried a
   weapon and she did not want him to get into trouble, she said.

   Other aspects of the crime, including chronology placing Newton with
   relatives about the time of the murders, suggest she may have been
   wrongly convicted, her attorneys said.

   Texas has put only two other women to death in modern times. Karla Faye
   Tucker was executed in 1998 for killing a Houston couple with a pickax,
   and Betty Lou Beets was put to death in 2000 for murdering her husband
   outside Dallas.

   Before them, the last woman put to death in Texas was Chipita
   Rodriguez. She was hanged in 1863 for the ax murder of a horse trader.

   Newton's was the final execution scheduled for this year. If it had
   been carried out, she would have been the 24th inmate executed in 2004.

   Drug 'could boost malaria fight'

   Mosquito
   Malaria is spread by mosquitoes

   Scientists have developed a new drug which they say could transform the
   fight against malaria.

   The drug is a synthetic version of Artemisinin, a herb extract that has
   been used for centuries in China.

   Artemisinin-based drugs are already available but the manufacturing
   process makes them expensive.

   Writing in Nature, scientists said they had succeeded in developing a
   drug in the laboratory that can mimic its effects at a fraction of the
   cost.

   Malaria kills about one million people around the world each year, most
   of them children. The disease - a parasitic infection - is spread by
   mosquitoes.

   The World Health Organization has set a target to reduce malaria deaths
   by half by 2010.

   However, increasing resistance to the cheap drugs used to treat the
   disease is threatening that plan.

   Expensive weapon

   Artemisinin-based drugs are regarded as the most effective weapon
   against malaria. However, their high cost puts them out of reach of
   millions of people in the developing world who need them most.

   "Making it is difficult and expensive," said Brian Greenwood, professor
   of tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
   Medicine.

   The fight is not over. Resistance to these drugs will evolve

   Professor Robert Sinden,
   Imperial College London

   "This is because it takes 18 months to grow and then the drug needs to
   be extracted."

   A factory-made version of the drug that can treat the disease at a
   fraction of the price could transform the fight against malaria.

   Scientists have recently finished animal and laboratory tests on their
   drug, which they have called OZ. They are now planning clinical trials
   on humans to see how effective it is.

   But the Medicines for Malaria Venture, which has helped to develop the
   drug, is already hailing it.

   "The drug could be the biggest breakthrough in malarial treatment of
   our generation and could become the most potent weapon against
   drug-resistant malaria," it said.

   However, other scientists have expressed caution. Malaria has shown a
   remarkable ability to develop and become resistant to drugs that used
   to beat it. The same could happen with OZ.

   "There is always great optimism when a new 'wonder drug' comes along,
   yet malaria parasites are extremely adept at evolving drug resistance,"
   said Andrew Read, professor of biology at Edinburgh University.

   "Let's hope the optimism is well placed this time, though history is
   not on our side."

   That view was echoed by Robert Sinden, professor of parasite cell
   biology at Imperial College London.

   "The fight is not over. Resistance to these drugs will evolve and the
   search for new drugs, vaccines and other measures to halt transmission
   of this expanding disease must be pursued with vigour."

   Fears over nurse poaching rules

   nurse
   The RCN says nurses are coming to the UK from countries 'who can least
   afford to lose them'

   Measures aimed at preventing nurses being poached from developing
   countries may not be tough enough, nurses' leaders have warned.

   The government is expected to set out a voluntary code to crack down on
   the practice later in the week.

   There is an existing ban - but it only covers NHS recruitment of
   permanent staff from these countries.

   The Royal College of Nursing welcomes moves to close loopholes but says
   the new rules should be mandatory.

   We would like to see something that had some teeth to it

   Beverley Malone, Royal College of Nursing

   Nursing staff from Africa are coming to work in the UK because pay is
   so much higher here than at home.

   More than 1,300 nurses arrived in Britain last year from South Africa,
   with another 500 coming from Nigeria.

   Many are hired by private hospitals. They can then be recruited by
   agencies looking for staff ready to transfer to the NHS.

   'Not just encouragement'

   The new measures are expected to ask private hospitals to sign up to
   the NHS code, covering 150 poor countries.

   In return they will be offered access to the government's international
   recruitment programme.

   The Royal College of Nursing says it welcomes any extension of the
   code, but says it fears it will not be strong enough.

   Beverley Malone, RCN General Secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today
   programme: "We would like to see something that had some teeth to it.

   "We would like to see the government implement something that does not
   just encourage, but says something must be done."

   Ms Malone said she would like the government to use inspectorates such
   as the Healthcare Commission to ensure the code was implemented.

   "It's been a back-door for the NHS to end up having nurses from those
   countries who can least afford to have nurses come, some of them
   African countries which are plagued by Aids."

   Britain has by-lateral agreements to hire nurses from Spain, the
   Philippines and China.

   Clean houses 'may trigger asthma'

   Image of a girl with asthma
   Indoor 'cleaning' fumes increased asthma risk

   Parents striving to keep a spotless house may unwittingly be triggering
   asthma in their children, a study says.

   Toddlers exposed to fumes from solvents and cleaning products at home
   are most at risk, Australian researchers found.

   Polishes, room fresheners and new carpets were some of the triggers
   identified by a Curtin University of Technology team, Thorax reported.

   Children exposed to the highest levels of volatile organic compounds
   were four times more likely to have asthma.

   Indoor fumes

   The authors measured levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the
   homes of 88 toddlers with asthma and 104 without.

   Levels measured were lower than recommended maximums.

   Domestic exposure to levels below currently accepted recommendations
   may increase the risk of childhood asthma.

   The study authors

   VOCs are irritants and indoor sources include solvents, floor
   adhesives, paint, furnishings and cleaning products.

   Levels were measured twice - once in the winter and again in the
   summer.

   The children's parents were asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire
   on their child's health.

   The researchers also tested the children for allergies.

   When the researchers looked at the individual types of VOCs, most
   appeared to be risk factors for asthma.

   Cancer link

   In particular, benzene - which is used to make rubbers, dyes and
   detergents and is also a component of gasoline, which has been linked
   to cancers - almost tripled the risk of asthma for every 10 unit
   increase of this compound.

   Another important risk factor for asthma was allergy.

   Three-quarters of the children with asthma had an allergy, compared
   with only half of the children without asthma.

   Lead researcher Dr Krassi Rumchev said given that some VOCs have also
   been shown to cause cancer, it would be important to determine
   acceptable indoor levels and what factors increase levels.

   "Domestic exposure to VOCs at levels below currently accepted
   recommendations may increase the risk of childhood asthma," they said.

   Measuring total VOCs might underestimate the risks associated with
   individual compounds, they added.

   Dr Matthew Hallsworth, from Asthma UK, said: "There has already been a
   lot of debate about whether outdoor air pollution may increase the risk
   of developing asthma.

   "This study reminds us that we should also consider indoor air quality
   and how it may affect the health of our lungs."

   Alternative for dental sedation

   The new technique uses two gases

   Dentists have developed an alternative to general anaesthesia for
   children who need to be sedated for complex dental work.

   The new method combines a sedative known as midazolam with a measured
   amount of two gases which cause relaxation and drowsiness.

   Tests carried out by a team at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne
   were completely successful in 93% of cases.

   Details of the procedure are published in the journal Anaesthesia.

   The technique gives real hope to children who are too scared to have
   teeth extracted or filled using standard sedation techniques

   Dr Nick Girdler

   It will potentially be particularly useful for use on children, who
   more often require complex dental work, and who may be scared of going
   to hospital for a general anaesthetic.

   The Newcastle team tried out the new method on more than 600 children
   with extreme dental problems who would usually attend hospital for a
   general anaesthetic (GA) for dental treatment.

   All were treated at a specialist dental practice, the Queensway Anxiety
   Management Clinic in Billingham, Teesside.

   The children, whose condition or anxiety was too severe to be treated
   using conventional techniques such as local anaesthetic alone, felt no
   pain under sedation.

   And although they remained conscious throughout they did not remember
   their treatment after it was completed.

   Not only did they avoid the risks of a general anaesthetic, they were
   sedated in a dentist's chair.

   The researchers say their results suggest the procedure could be used
   as a way of reducing hospital waiting lists and freeing beds.

   They are calling for a reform of dental services to allow alternatives
   to hospital-based GA for dental procedures to be offered in specialist
   practices.

   The UK Government banned dental surgeries from performing them in
   January 2002, following several patient deaths, and it transferred
   responsibility for dental GAs to hospitals.

   Three methods

   Taylor Mendoza
   Taylor Mendoza underwent the new procedure

   The Newcastle team tested three new sedative procedures on groups of
   children who had been referred to Queensway Anxiety Management Clinic.

   In the group given a combination of nitrous oxide and sevoflurane and
   intravenous midazolam by a consultant anaesthetist, 249 out of 267
   children completed their treatment successfully.

   Dr Paul Averley, principal dentist at Queensway Anxiety Management
   Clinic, developed the techniques.

   He said: "Dentists are often suspicious about procedures that involve
   sedating children with intravenous agents like midazolam.

   "However, we showed that it worked very effectively when combined with
   inhalation agents and we saw no adverse reactions.

   "The children were treated by a highly trained team, which included a
   consultant anaesthetist, and they also had have the benefit of shorter
   waiting times and treatment in familiar surroundings."

   Less scary

   Dr Nick Girdler, head of the Sedation Department at Newcastle Dental
   Hospital & School, said: "These results are very exciting.

   "The technique gives real hope to children who are too scared to have
   teeth extracted or filled using standard sedation techniques."

   Five-year-old Taylor Mendoza was petrified of going to the dentist and
   was referred to Queensway Anxiety Management Clinic by her dentist
   because she was too frightened for him to treat her properly.

   Her father Dave said: "She was quite nervous when she first arrived at
   Queensway but as soon as she was given the sedation she calmed down and
   relaxed.

   "She came out very proud of herself and smiling as if nothing had
   happened. We're very happy with the outcome."

   A spokesperson for the British Dental Association said: "This is an
   interesting study that widens the evidence base for this treatment.

   "The BDA welcomes anything that adds to the deeper understanding of
   sedation procedures."

   Prof Raman Bedi, Chief Dental Officer for England, said: "About 7% of
   our child population have very high levels of anxiety about having
   dental treatment.

   "These children need additional help if they require dental treatment,
   so I welcome new evidence-based approaches that tackle this problem.

   "The initial findings of the research team at the Newcastle Dental
   School appear encouraging."

   Public 'want smoking age raised'

   Woman smoking in a pub
   Two thirds backed a smoking ban in pubs

   Four out of five people want the legal smoking age to be raised from 16
   to 18 to deter young people from taking up the habit, a BBC poll
   suggests.

   ICM conducted the nationwide phone poll of 1,010 adults in England,
   Wales and Scotland between 20 and 22 August.

   The majority of people believed raising the age at which teenagers
   could buy cigarettes would deter them from taking up the habit.

   A slight majority thought the age limit should be raised to 21.

   White Paper

   The BBC's Healthy Britain poll questioned people about a range of
   public health issues. Further data will be revealed later this week.

   HEALTH POLL: SMOKING

   Key findings from the BBC's poll on attitudes to public health

   In graphics

   The survey found the public also backed tough measures to reduce the
   numbers of children who smoke.

   Of those questioned, 93% supported increasing and enforcing the
   penalties for selling tobacco to children, and two thirds said parents
   who consistently allow their under-age children to smoke should
   ultimately face prosecution.

   Just over half also thought smoking should be made more expensive, and
   three-quarters said there should be more spent on anti-smoking
   publicity campaigns.

   The government is currently considering whether smoking should be
   restricted in the workplace, including pubs and clubs.

   Its decision will be revealed in a Public Health White Paper, due to be
   published this autumn.

   Raising the age isn't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the
   shop

   Why do young people keep smoking?

   In the BBC survey, two thirds of those questioned were in favour of
   such a ban.

   But while 69% thought government should be trying to change people's
   behaviour on smoking - including half of the smokers questioned - 64%
   think that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them.

   Melanie Johnson, the public health minister, told the BBC progress had
   already been made in cutting smoking among young teenagers.

   However, she said public feedback to the government's consultation on
   public health had not indicated that raising the legal smoking age was
   a particular priority.

   Dr Vivienne Nathanson, of the British Medical Association, said: "The
   best way to prevent young people from smoking is to ban smoking in
   enclosed public places, increase taxation on cigarettes and enforce
   exisiting age limit legislation.

   "What we need to concentrate on is where one person's "enjoyment" harms
   others and this means the government showing leadership and following
   the examples of Ireland and Norway."

   'Still desirable'

   A spokesman for the group Action on Smoking and Health said: "We are
   strongly against young people smoking or buying cigarettes for others.

   The suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21 shows how hysterical
   the smoking debate has become

   Simon Clark, Forest

   But he said simply raising the legal age for buying cigarettes may not
   have much effect.

   "Teenagers are notoriously sharp at getting round such restrictions and
   they would be hard to enforce.

   "More important may be to stop smoking being seen as a desirable and
   adult thing to do - stop adults smoking and teenagers are much less
   likely to start. That's one reason why we see ending smoking at work as
   a top priority."

   Daniel Jones, 16, started smoking when he was 12. He now smokes 20
   cigarettes a day. He did not think raising the age restriction would
   make any difference.

   "Raising the age isn't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the
   shop," he said.

   Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights group Forest, said, while it
   supported "reasonable measures that made it more difficult for people
   under 18 to buy tobacco.

   He added: "However, the suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21
   shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become.

   "The law needs to be consistent. At present you can have sex at 16,
   drive a car at 17, and drink alcohol in a pub at 18. Some people would
   even like to lower the voting age from 18 to 16.

   "There needs to be a clear point at which children are legally declared
   to be adults and are therefore considered mature enough to make their
   own decisions about their health and lifestyle."

   Public in two minds over health
   Analysis
   By Mark Easton
   BBC News Home Editor
   The great British public is currently being consulted about what should
   be done to improve public health.

   But if government ministers were hoping the results would deliver
   solutions they will be frustrated.

   One moment we want the government to ban anything which is bad for us,
   the next we say we do not think government should interfere in such
   matters.

   Smoking Many don't want a total smoking ban

   For example, how does one reconcile these two findings in a poll
   commissioned by the BBC?

   Almost 70% of those questioned think the government should try to wean
   people off the fags.

   Yet 64% believe that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them.

   HEALTH POLL: SMOKING

   Key findings from the BBC's poll on attitudes to public health

   In graphics

   It is the same story for alcohol - large majorities think government
   should encourage us to drink healthily but simultaneously believe how
   much people drink is up to them and government should butt out.

   So what is going on?

   The BBC's Healthy Britain survey is one of the most detailed snapshots
   of public opinion in this area ever taken.

   Anxiety and distrust

   Britain is like a well-intentioned but fallible smoker.

   It reveals a nation which is clearly anxious about public health and
   wants someone to make the problem go away.

   But we are also a country that distrusts politicians and values
   individual freedoms.

   We are torn. "Stop me, stop me!" we say in one breath.

   But when the image of that cream cake floats into our mind we balk at
   the idea of the "health police" coming between us and our waistline.

   The phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has tried to give up
   smoking.

   Brimming with good intentions, we tell our friends that should they see
   us about to light up they have permission to snatch up the dreaded fags
   and crush them before our eyes.

   But, of course, our friends wouldn't remain friends very long if they
   actually did such a thing.

   Faced with our failure, we expect sympathy and support.

   Britain is like that well-intentioned but fallible smoker.

   Mixed messages

   Our survey shows that most people, (55%) would like to see the age
   youngsters can buy tobacco raised from 16 to 21.

   Some 80% think it should be raised to 18. We want government to get
   tougher with those who sell tobacco to under-age children.

   Obesity
   Obesity is a major problem

   Two-thirds of us would ban smoking in any public place, including pubs
   and clubs.

   These figures suggest Britain has turned against the weed.

   With Scotland set to follow Ireland's example and forbid people from
   lighting up in bars and restaurants, the momentum is firmly with the
   anti-smoking lobby.

   Yet a closer look at the figures suggests the issue is not quite that
   black and white.

   When asked to choose from a range of options for work-places, the
   largest group (44%) preferred the idea of designated smoking areas to a
   ban.

   One in five people thinks it should be up to individual employers to
   decide in consultation with staff.

   Less than a third - 32% said they wanted total prohibition.

   Radicalism

   Nevertheless, the survey shows that many of us do want a radical
   solution.

   A majority (53%) want even higher tax on cigarettes.

   A significant minority would like to see parents prosecuted if they let
   their under-age kids smoke, and a surprising proportion, even among
   smokers, believes the government should move towards making tobacco an
   illegal drug.

   The same contradictions are evident in attitudes to how government
   should tackle obesity, alcohol abuse and sexually transmitted
   infections.

   Do something, but don't tell me how to live my life.

   We see these issues as matters of "public health" (the politicians'
   problem) rather than "personal responsibility" (my problem).

   Government role

   In the USA there is a lively debate as to where responsibility of state
   and individual falls in relation to diet.

   This new opinion poll suggests deep anxiety about public health.

   Should government do more, or should the burden fall on those who are
   overweight?

   Increasingly, private health insurers in America are prevented from
   charging obese clients higher premiums.

   Generation XXL is a powerful lobby group. But as Radley Balko of the
   right-wing Cato Institute recently put it: "If the government is paying
   for my anti-cholesterol medication, what incentive is there for me to
   put down the cheeseburger?"

   He argues that healthy lifestyles should be rewarded and poor ones
   penalised, an idea we tested in our poll.

   Should people who refuse to take responsibility for their health have
   to contribute toward the cost of their care or even be denied NHS
   treatment?

   Once again, sizeable minorities agreed with those ideas, suggesting
   that the debate about where responsibility lies is far from closed.

   Smokers, of course, can argue that they already pay far more in tax
   than it costs to treat them and currently it is politically
   inconceivable to undermine the principle of free-access to the NHS.

   Ministers have spent the past few weeks trying to formulate a "New
   Labour" philosophy on public health and have concluded that it is not
   for politicians to tell people how to live their lives.

   Banning is not the New Labour way. But this new opinion poll suggests
   deep anxiety about public health as the government prepares to publish
   its White Paper on the subject this Autumn.

   Britain wants something done.

   ICM conducted a nationwide phone poll of 1,010 adults between 20 and 22
   August.

   Hypnosis 'reduces cancer pain'
   By Paul Rincon
   BBC News Online science staff, at the BA festival

   Brain
   Hypnosis can affect the left frontal cortex of the brain in some

   Childhood cancer patients suffer less pain when placed under hypnosis,
   scientists have claimed.

   Children who had been hypnotised in trials reported they had less pain
   from medical procedures as well as cancer-related pain.

   Dr Christina Liossi, from University of Wales, Swansea, suggested there
   was even tentative evidence that hypnosis prolonged the lives of cancer
   patients.

   The research is being presented at the BA Festival of Science in
   Exeter.

   In one study, 80 children were placed in four groups: two experimental
   groups who were treated with an anaesthetic and hypnosis.

   Two control groups were just given the anaesthetic.

   "All [40] children who used hypnosis with a local anaesthetic felt much
   less pain than children who were just given the local anaesthetic,"
   said Dr Liossi.

   The children, aged six to 16, were placed under hypnosis by experts and
   then taught to hypnotise themselves before they underwent procedures.

   Children not treated with hypnosis were talked to and counselled
   instead.

   "We asked children to rate their pain from 0 to 5 on a graded scale.
   Before we perform hypnosis we ask them to rate their pain on this
   scale," Dr Liossi explained.

   "Then we introduce hypnosis and then we ask them to rate pain again and
   they report much less."

   Brain changes

   Other evidence presented at the festival also supports the idea that
   hypnosis is a genuine physical state and that people are not simply
   deceiving themselves into thinking they are hypnotised.

   There are some studies and there are some encouraging results from
   these that hypnosis can probably improve the survival of cancer
   patients. But at the moment there isn't enough evidence

   Dr Christina Liossi

   Individuals who are highly susceptible to being placed under hypnosis
   show that there are changes in the left frontal cortex of the brain and
   a structure called the cingulated gyrus when viewed through a
   functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner.

   "The frontal lobe is concerned with our planning, our future actions,
   our analysis of the here and now, our critical evaluation and the
   things we do so we don't make silly mistakes," said Dr John Gruzelier
   of Imperial College, London.

   "If you think about what the hypnotist does, he asks you to go with the
   flow and not critically analyse what you're doing."

   Dr Liossi suggested there was even evidence that hypnosis might prolong
   life in adult cancer patients.

   "There are some studies and there are some encouraging results from
   these," she said.

   Adult cancer patients placed under hypnosis show fewer cancer-related
   symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and pain, said Dr Liossi.

   "There are some studies and there are some encouraging results from
   these that hypnosis can probably improve the survival of cancer
   patients.

   "But at the moment there isn't enough evidence."

   Britons told to cut salt intake

   Pizza
   Salt content of pizzas varied widely

   A major government food campaign is aiming to persuade Britons to limit
   their salt intake.

   The Food Standards Agency hopes the 26m people who it says are
   consuming more salt than is healthy for them will heed its health
   warnings.

   High salt consumption can contribute to high blood pressure, which can
   lead to heart disease and stroke, it says.

   However, salt manufacturers say the government's £4m campaign is
   unfairly targeting one of life's essentials.

   The FSA said every day at least 26m people eat more than the
   recommended daily limit of 6g of salt.

   Everybody has got used to eating too much salt

   Sir John Krebs
   Food Standards Agency

   Men are eating almost double that, with a daily average of 11g of salt
   while women consume an average of 8.1g a day.

   Approximately 75% of salt consumed is from processed foods, 10-15% is
   added by consumers and 10-15% is naturally present in food, the FSA
   said.

   FSA chairman Sir John Krebs told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We
   have a very simple health message. Too much salt is bad for your heart.

   "There are 26m people in this country eating too much salt and they are
   increasing their risk of heart disease and stroke."

   Prescription costs

   The food agency said high blood pressure is a cause or contributing
   factor in 170,000 deaths a year in England.

   However, studies show that reducing salt in the diet can lower blood
   pressure within four weeks - helping not only the individual but also
   the NHS, which spends about £840m on prescriptions for reducing high
   blood pressure.

   DAILY SALT INTAKE

   Recommended: 6g
   Men (average): 11g
   Women (average): 8.1g

   Source: FSA

   Sir John described high blood pressure as a silent killer, as those
   living with it are three times more likely to develop heart disease and
   stroke.

   But Peter Sherratt, general secretary of the Salt Manufacturers'
   Association, described the campaign as "spin" because, he said, salt
   had no impact on blood pressure for people who had not been diagnosed
   with hypertension.

   "All the major research over the last 10 or 15 years shows that it
   doesn't. You're sitting there with something like a cupful of salt
   inside you and it makes you work. Without it, you would be in deep
   trouble.

   "It enables your brain to communicate with your hands and feet, your
   muscles to operate, your heart to pump and it helps you digest your
   food. Too much salt is not bad for your heart."

   Mr Sherratt said there was a possibility that cutting salt out of the
   diet could actually put some vulnerable people at risk.

   Japanese people consume four times as much salt as people in the UK,
   but has the highest average longevity in the world, he claimed.

   Supermarkets' role

   The FSA said that manufacturers also had a role to play by reducing
   salt in processed foods and better labelling of salt on food products,
   which would help people change their diet.

   The Independent says some leading supermarket chains have refused a
   government request to update ways to cut back on salt content in their
   foods.

   The public health minister Melanie Johnson wrote to leading food
   manufacturers in June, asking them to beef up their plans for reducing
   salt in their products.

   But her letter provoked a furious reaction from food industry
   representatives, who argued that they had already agreed plans for a
   substantial cut in salt levels.

   Alison Austin, speaking on behalf of Sainsbury's, said on BBC Radio 4's
   The World At One programme that they had been working on a three-year
   programme on salt reduction and were 10 months into that.

   "We dispute the fact that our plan is vague and is not doing enough
   because it was agreed with the Food Standards Agency."

   Sir John said some supermarkets such as Sainsbury's had already
   implemented reduction plans agreed with the FSA. But improvements
   varied between retailers.

   Jab linked to multiple sclerosis

   Image of a syringe
   'High risk' people should be immunised

   People who are vaccinated against hepatitis B are at increased risk of
   multiple sclerosis, a study shows.

   US public health experts found the link when they looked at data on
   more than 1,500 UK patients.

   The Harvard team does not know whether the vaccine causes MS in those
   prone to the disease or speeds up MS in those destined to have it.

   The benefits of protecting against hepatitis might outweigh any risk,
   wrote the authors in Neurology.

   Immunisation against hepatitis B was associated with a three-fold
   increase in the incidence of MS

   Lead researcher Dr Miguel Hernàn

   In the UK, people who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of
   their lifestyle, occupation or other factors such as close contact with
   a case or carrier are advised to be immunised against this virus.

   It is passed from person to person through blood contact. The virus may
   also be present in saliva, vaginal secretions, and other body fluids.

   This means people at high risk include intravenous drug misusers,
   individuals who change sexual partners frequently, health care workers,
   prisoners and prison staff and those travelling to areas of high
   prevalence such as the Far East.

   Conflicting evidence

   About one in four infected of those with hepatitis B will develop a
   serious liver disease such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or liver
   cancer develops after a number of years.

   In recent years, concerns have been raised that the vaccine may trigger
   serious autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis

   These fears were fueled in the 1990s when about 200 people in France
   developed MS shortly after receiving the hepatitis B vaccine.

   In February 2001, the results of a long-term study of hepatitis B
   vaccine and MS in nurses were published in the New England Journal of
   Medicine.

   This study, by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health, found no
   link between the two.

   The association may be much less than the three fold increase suggested
   here

   A spokeswoman from the British Liver Trust

   However, some of the same researchers now believe there is a link.

   In the latest study Dr Miguel Hernàn and colleagues looked at people
   registered with a GP in the UK who had been diagnosed with MS between
   1993 and 2000.

   When they looked at hepatitis B immunisation patterns among these 163
   MS patients and 1,604 'control' patients without MS from the same GP
   database, they found a link between the vaccine and MS.

   Dr Hernàn said: "We estimated that immunisation against hepatitis B was
   associated with a three-fold increase in the incidence of MS within
   three years following vaccination."

   He said more research would be needed to find out why this might be.

   Caution

   "It is also important to stress that 93% of the MS cases in our study
   had not been vaccinated," he said.

   Thus, for some, the small risk of MS posed by immunisation would be far
   outweighed by the protection against potentially fatal liver problems,
   he said.

   In an accompanying editorial, Dr Robert Naismith and Dr Anne Cross from
   Washington University said: "This article should be viewed as another
   piece of the puzzle of MS causation."

   It is obvious that the serious risks of hepatitis B vastly outweigh any
   very small possible risk from vaccination

   A spokesman for the Multiple Sclerosis Society

   They said the findings were not strong enough to suggest that current
   immunisation policy should be changed in any way.

   A spokeswoman from the British Liver Trust said the findings were
   interesting but the suggested link should be viewed with some caution.

   "Given that many vaccinations for hepatitis B are given in a workplace
   setting, it is possible that a proportion of vaccinations do not figure
   in the control group's records.

   "We don't know whether that has been taken account of in the research.

   "If it hasn't then the association may be much less than the three fold
   increase suggested here," she said.

   A spokesman for the Multiple Sclerosis Society said: "We need to study
   these findings in the context of other recent research which has shown
   no link between the vaccination and MS.

   "Even on this evidence, however, it is obvious that the serious risks
   of hepatitis B vastly outweigh any very small possible risk from
   vaccination."

   The MS Trust agreed, saying: "On the basis of this study, one wouldn't
   want policy as regards to vaccine, to be changed, particularly with
   such a lethal disease."

   Doubt cast on Red Bull 'effect'

   Red Bull
   Many people drink Red Bull with alcohol

   Energy drink Red Bull does not give drinkers the ability to party all
   night, research suggests.

   A study of 136 clubbers revealed one in four thought mixing it with
   alcohol boosted their energy.

   But Brazilian scientists, reporting in Alcoholism: Clinical and
   Experimental Research, said their tests had shown this was not the
   case.

   A Red Bull spokeswoman said the drink was not meant to give increased
   energy levels when consumed with alcohol.

   The team at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, asked 136 clubbers in
   the country about their Red Bull drinking habits.

   They found that three quarters did combine the energy drink - marketed
   as the drink that "gives you wings" - with alcohol, because they
   believed it increased the stimulative effect, or lowered the depressive
   effect of alcohol.

   Just over a third reported increased happiness, 30% euphoria, 26% said
   they became more extrovert and 24% reported increased vigour.

   The researcher then put 14 healthy volunteers through a cycling
   endurance test an hour after drinking water, alcohol, Red Bull or Red
   Bull mixed with alcohol, over a four-week period.

   Heart rate

   The test lasted until a set heart rate was reached or the volunteer
   asked to stop.

   An hour after the test, researchers checked the volunteers' heart
   rates, blood pressure and respiratory rates.

   The results showed that when Red Bull was consumed with alcohol it did
   not improve performance or reduce the effects of alcohol.

   Energy

   Report author Maria Formigoni said: "In Brazil, as in other countries,
   the use of energy drinks such as Red Bull is relatively common in bars
   and night clubs.

   "Many young people use them mixed with vodka, whisky and other spirits.

   "I think the main message of our study is that this kind of beverage,
   at least in the tested doses, does not increase people's performance in
   physical activities or reduce alterations induced by acute alcohol
   ingestion."

   A spokeswoman for Red Bull said: "Red Bull is a non-alcoholic drink,
   however some consumers do like to mix it with different types of
   alcohol.

   "While we do not promote Red Bull as a mixer with alcohol as this might
   impair its positive effects, there is also no reason why it should not,
   like any other drink, be mixed with alcohol as long as people do not
   underestimate that alcohol consumption might impair their mental and
   physical activities.

   "Red Bull is not designed to counteract this."

   Discuss death with dying children

   Image of a child
   A quarter of parents regretted not talking about death

   Parents regret not discussing death with their children who are
   terminally ill, a survey shows.

   Many who could not bring themselves to raise the issue later wished
   they had, Swedish researchers from the Karolinska Institute found.

   Yet none of 147 parents who talked to their child about death regretted
   it.

   The findings, based on a questionnaire of 449 parents of children with
   terminal cancer, appear in the New England Journal of Medicine.

   I have seen children with cancer respond to the idea of their dying
   with startling maturity

   Dr Lawrence Wolf, from the Tufts-New England Medical Centre in Boston,
   US

   They might help parents faced with the same difficult decision, the
   researchers believe.

   Dr Ulrika Kreicbergs and colleagues asked 449 parents who had lost a
   child to cancer if they had discussed death directly with the child.

   They then asked these parents whether or not they regretted the
   decision.

   None of the parents who discussed death with the child had regrets,
   whereas 27 percent of the parents who did not talk with their child
   about death regretted not having done so.

   Regret

   Of those 27 percent, the majority regretted it because they realised
   that their child seemed to be aware of his or her imminent death.

   Mothers were also more likely than fathers to regret not having talked
   about death with their child, as were parents of older children
   compared with parents of younger children.

   Parents who regretted their decision were twice as likely to experience
   depression afterwards.

   I always try to get families to talk about it. Often children are much
   more aware about what is going on than parents think

   Dr Kevin Windebank, consultant paediatric oncologist at the Royal
   Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle

   The researchers said: "It is possible that the parents who did not
   respond to the sense that the child was aware of his or her imminent
   death by talking to the child about it experienced an inner conflict, a
   conflict that continued after the child's death, when it no longer
   could be resolved."

   Parents who did discuss dying with their child were more likely to be
   older themselves, be religious, retired or on sick leave and to have
   sensed that their child was aware of his or her terminal condition.

   Dr Lawrence Wolf, from the Tufts-New England Medical Centre in Boston,
   US, said the findings should reassure parents and doctors that it is
   right to be open about illness with children.

   "I have seen children with cancer respond to the idea of their dying
   with startling maturity.

   "A nine-year-old boy left a legacy by giving his prized possessions to
   his friends, planned his funeral, and decided what he would wear to his
   burial."

   Dr Kevin Windebank, consultant paediatric oncologist at the Royal
   Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, said: "This is a really interesting
   thing to do and a good thing to do. It's a difficult area and to find
   out more is important."

   He said, in his experience, families who had open discussions with the
   dying child, at an appropriate level, had as positive experiences as
   one could hope for, particularly when there were other siblings
   involved.

   "Siblings can have happy feelings about their brother or sister earlier
   when the family is open about it," he said.

   "I always try to get families to talk about it. Often children are much
   more aware about what is going on than parents think."

   Alan Phillips, manager of the Alder Centre in Liverpool, which provides
   care and education for anybody affected by the death of a child, said:
   "Openness and honesty is the best policy.

   "If a child asks the question then they are ready for an answer if it
   is appropriate.

   "If parents feel out of their depth they should seek help and advice.
   You are not alone," he said.

   Malawi fears over tobacco treaty

   Tobacco leaves
   Tobacco prices have fallen by 50% over the last 10 years

   Malawi, one of the biggest producers of tobacco, is coming under
   pressure to sign a new treaty limiting its production.

   The World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
   has been signed by 168 countries.

   Tobacco, or "green gold", accounts for 70% of Malawi's export earnings,
   the BBC's Health Matters reports.

   Some government ministers are concerned signing up to the convention
   could mean millions are condemned to poverty.

   Malawi is the largest producer of burley - a type of tobacco
   particularly favoured by manufacturers as a filler in cigarettes.

   The crop accounts for up to one third of the country's Gross Domestic
   Product. In Malawi the mantra is tobacco saves, not kills.

   But this situation could change. The World Health Organization
   estimates five million people die from tobacco related illness each
   year.

   'Technical reasons'

   The convention seeks to reduce both supply and demand of tobacco and
   its possible effect is dividing a country that ranks among the 10
   poorest nations in the world.

   While 168 countries have signed the convention and another 31 have
   ratified it, it must be ratified by nine more to become meaningful in
   terms of International law.

   Malawi is one of those countries which has yet to sign.

   Dr Wesley Sengala of the Ministry of Health ascribes the failure to
   sign to "technical reasons".

   But in a country where smoking rates are relatively low and the burden
   of tobacco related illness pales into insignificance alongside the
   HIV/Aids epidemic, public health arguments hold little sway.

   However, the convention does take into account tobacco dependent
   countries.

   It offers monetary and technical assistance for countries to wean
   themselves off tobacco.

   Dr Sengala is using these economic and agricultural imperatives to win
   over the sceptics in government.

   "What we are explaining is that we could take advantage of this
   framework to diversify our economy," he said.

   However, not everyone remains convinced. Chakufwa Chiana, the Minister
   of Agriculture, is palpably aware of the fragility of Malawi's
   monoculture, but his resistance is based on the effects tobacco
   controls may have.

   He wants to invite the WHO to Malawi to see "the scale of poverty that
   will engulf the seven million people that will be affected by the
   impact of this convention".

   Yet Malawi may face a more immediate crisis. Over the last 10 years
   tobacco prices have fallen by up to 50%.

   The WHO believes this is a result of the tobacco industry transferring
   their increasing litigation costs on to the tobacco producers.

   Rather than encouraging diversification, the price drops have
   encouraged farmers to seek out more profitable forms of tobacco - like
   flue cured.

   But Dr Sengala believes change is coming. Following talks with the
   recently elected President Bingu wa Mutharika, he thinks that Malawi
   could sign the convention in the next three months.

   Signing could be the easiest step. Changing the mindset of Malawian's
   maybe the greatest challenge of all.

   UN 'must ignore cloning ban call'

   Cloned human embryos
   Stem cells could provide treatment for diseases such as Alzheimer's

   The United Nations should ignore a call by George Bush to ban all forms
   of human cloning, say UK scientists.

   The US president told the UN last month member countries should support
   a Costa Rican proposal to ban both reproductive and therapeutic
   cloning.

   But the Royal Society urged countries to back a second proposal from
   Belgium at the UN vote on 20 and 21 October.

   The proposal would allow countries to make their own decision on
   therapeutic cloning but bans reproductive cloning.

   Therapeutic cloning has been legal in Britain since 2002.

   The US government's approach at the UN appears more designed to
   influence domestic legislation

   Lord May, of the Royal Society

   It involves cloning embryos and harvesting stem cells from them.

   The embryos are destroyed before they are 14 days old and never allowed
   to develop beyond a cluster of cells the size of a pinhead.

   Reproductive cloning - the cloning of human embryos with the intention
   of creating a baby - is still strictly banned in the UK.

   Lord May of Oxford, president of the Royal Society, the UK's national
   academy of science, said: "The US should be allowed to decide whether
   therapeutic cloning should be outlawed within its borders.

   "But other countries, including the UK, have now passed legislation to
   allow carefully regulated therapeutic cloning while introducing a ban
   on reproductive cloning."

   He warned if the UN could not reach a workable resolution the risk was
   that maverick scientists would attempt reproductive cloning in
   countries that have not passed laws against it.

   Ban

   Lord May said: "The alternative Belgian proposal, which is backed by
   the UK government, seeks to ban human reproductive cloning worldwide
   but to allow individual countries to make their own decision on
   therapeutic cloning.

   "If this proposal was successful, the United States and others would
   still be free to ban all human cloning but countries that see the
   promise offered by therapeutic cloning can still carry out research."

   Lord May added: "The US government's approach at the UN appears more
   designed to influence domestic legislation, where attempts to introduce
   a total ban have so far failed, at the expense of a workable
   international ban on reproductive cloning.

   "Indeed, the US has not yet outlawed reproductive cloning itself."

   Health Secretary John Reid said the UK government would not support any
   move to ban therapeutic cloning as "we believe it offers huge potential
   to develop new cures for life threatening diseases such as Parkinson's
   and Alzheimer's' which blight the lives of millions".

   But he added: "The UK is totally opposed to reproductive cloning and we
   are working at the United Nations to achieve an effective world wide
   ban on reproductive cloning."

   Last year, the UN voted by a slim margin to postpone the decision,
   despite powerful lobbying by the US.

   Earlier this year, scientists from the University of Newcastle were
   granted a licence to clone human embryos in the UK for medical
   research.

   Stem cells from early embryos could potentially be used to provide new
   treatments for incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and
   Parkinson's.

   Caesareans 'raise allergy risk'

   Delivery
   There are health concerns about Caesareans

   Babies born by Caesarean section may have a greater risk of suffering
   food allergies and diarrhoea during their first 12 months, research
   suggests.

   A team at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians University studied 865 babies all
   fed on breast milk until four months.

   They found C-section babies were more likely to have diarrhoea in their
   first year, and were twice as likely to be allergic to cows' milk and
   other food.

   The research is published in Archives of Disease in Childhood.

   It is not surprising that this method of delivery might lead to a
   slight difference in the way the immune system develops

   Dr Basky Thilaganathan

   All the babies in the study were born into families with a history of
   allergies.

   They were monitored at one, four, eight and 12 months of age.

   Blood samples were also taken after 12 months to check for signs of an
   allergic response to foods, including eggs, cows' milk proteins, and
   soy protein.

   And during the first six months, their mothers completed weekly diaries
   on their children's health and feeding.

   In all, 147 of the 865 babies had been born by C-section, a rate of
   17%.

   The researchers say previous work has suggested that gut bacteria play
   a key role in the development of the immune system.

   They believe that C-section alters or delays the "normal" bacterial
   colonisation of the baby's gut.

   It may be that vaginally delivered babies pick up bacteria from the
   mother's vagina, intestine and anal area, whereas babies born by
   C-section merely acquire bacteria from the hospital environment.

   Possible flaws

   Dr Basky Thilaganathan, consultant in foetal medicine at St George's,
   told BBC News Online: "Caesarean section is not a physiological way of
   being born, and so it is not surprising that this method of delivery
   might lead to a slight difference in the way the immune system
   develops."

   However, Dr Thilaganathan said there were a number of flaws in the
   study which raised questions about the veracity of its findings.

   A quarter of the babies born by C-section were born two to three weeks
   before full term, he said, and therefore subsequent problems might
   simply be due to the relatively immature state of the immune system at
   birth.

   In addition, a higher number of the C-section babies were first
   children than those born by vaginal delivery.

   It was well known, said Dr Thilaganathan, that first-time parents were
   more likely to report even minor symptoms than those who had previously
   had other children.

   Dr Thilaganathan also said that many of C-sections were done during
   labour, casting doubt on the theory that these babies were not exposed
   to their mother's bacteria.

   Finally, he said the study had not set out to show a link between
   C-section and allergy, and that this might simply have been thrown up
   by chance as a result of an intensive statistical analysis of the data.

RFID Tags May Not Reduce Drug Counterfeiting

   RFID Tags May Not Reduce Drug Counterfeiting

   Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, said it would begin shipments of
   the tagged medication this week. Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, said it
   would begin shipping RFID-tagged bottles by the end of next year.
   GlaxoSmithKline has also said it would begin using the tags.
   By Susan B. Shor • CRM Buyer • ECT News Network
   Nov 15, 2004 4:06 PM PT

   The move to add tiny radio antennas on shipments of pharmaceuticals
   will not be enough to prevent counterfeiting and tampering, analysts
   said.

   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several drug makers
   announced they would be putting RFID-tagged labels on medicine bottles
   beginning with the impotency drug Viagra, which is heavily
   counterfeited, and the narcotic pain reliever OxyContin.

Creating a Trail

   The tags would help create an electronic trail so shipments could be
   checked to make sure each progressed properly along the supply chain.

   The problem is that the technology has limitations, Jeff Woods,
   principal analyst with Gartner, told CRM Buyer.

   "RFID doesn't work as advertised," he said. "A lot of people believe
   you can put tags on cases on the pallet and they'll all be within the
   right line of vision, and all the tags will be read, but it's not true.
   Normal tag configurations have only 70 percent read rates."

   He said that with advances in packaging and if the cases are stacked in
   the exact right configuration, read rates would go up, but "that would
   be very difficult and time consuming."

Other Measures Needed

   This is one step toward combating the problem of counterfeiting.
   However, Woods said other steps must be taken in concert with it. He
   mentioned new packaging, holograms and safety seals as other features
   that will help reduce the growing problem.

   Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, said it would begin shipments of
   the tagged medication this week. Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, said it
   would begin shipping RFID-tagged bottles by the end of next year.
   GlaxoSmithKline has also said it would begin using the tags.

   For the RFID industry, this is a small win. But Woods said the
   technology has been "just around the corner" for a long time and never
   quite makes it. He added that he believes that the way for RFID to make
   inroads is by looking away from replacing barcodes and toward
   industries, such as hospitals and retail shops, where barcodes have not
   been successful in tracking inventory because of the difficulty in
   enforcing their use. [end-enn.gif]

   What makes women's cancers deadly

   It can be hard to predict outcomes

   Scientists believe they have found a way to spot which breast and
   ovarian cancers are likely to be aggressive.

   A team from the University of Texas, in the US, found cancer cells that
   overexpressed a particular protein were more likely to be fatal.

   Low levels of the protein in ovarian cancer was linked with an 80%
   chance of surviving for five years compared to a 50% chance with high
   levels.

   The findings, based on a study of 100 women, appear in Nature Medicine.

   Aggressive tumours

   They matched tumour samples to outcomes in women diagnosed with either
   breast or ovarian cancer.

   They found that a low level of a protein called Rab25 in the tumour
   sample was associated with a better clinical outcome in both types of
   cancer.

   In breast cancer, the chance of surviving five years after treatment
   was 60% if Rab25 levels were low, but was only 40% if Rab25 levels were
   high.

   We are pursuing Rab25 both as a test for outcomes and as a possible
   treatment

   Lead researcher Dr Gordon Mills

   The scientists are hopeful that adding this protein to other known
   markers of cancer progression could enable doctors to make accurate
   predictions of outcomes for women with breast and ovarian cancers.

   Not only that, but the protein might offer a way of treating these
   cancers.

   Lead author Dr Gordon Mills said: "We are pursuing Rab25 both as a test
   for outcomes and as a possible treatment."

   He said experimental drugs based on blocking the function of the
   protein were being tested.

   But he said: "We have a long way to go to understanding exactly what it
   is that Rab25 is doing, and how we might be able to use it in
   treatment."

   Cancer Research UK funded biochemist Dr Jim Norman, from the University
   of Leicester, said: "This study is extremely exciting.

   "This indicates that Rab25 could be used in the clinic as a marker of
   tumour aggressiveness and patient outcome.

   "It also earmarks the Rab25 and Rab11 proteins and the membrane
   recycling pathways they control as targets for anti-cancer drug
   design."

   Karen Scanlon from Breast Cancer Care said: "We feel that more research
   is needed to fully understand the workings of the Rab25 protein before
   it can be used as a predictive test of survival for women with breast
   or ovarian cancer."

   Breakthrough Breast Cancer echoed this caution.

   Top US judge treated for cancer

   US Supreme Court Chief Justice William H Rehnquist Rehnquist presided
   over ex-President Clinton's impeachment

   US Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist is in hospital after
   throat surgery for thyroid cancer.

   The 80-year-old judge underwent a tracheotomy on Saturday at the
   Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, the Supreme Court said in a
   statement.

   He was one of five members of the court who voted to end the 2000
   election recount, leading to George Bush's win.

   The conservative judge also presided over the impeachment hearings
   against former President Bill Clinton.

   He is expected back on the bench when the country's highest court
   returns to work on 1 November, the court statement said.

   News of his illness will put the issue of Supreme Court appointments
   back on the presidential election agenda, James Coomarasamy reports
   from Washington.

   He says the appointments are made by the president and are highly
   political.

   The nine-member court is able to take final decisions on issues ranging
   from the result of a presidential election to a woman's right to have
   an abortion, he notes.

   Several of the serving justices are over 70, so whoever wins the poll
   on 2 November could appoint up to four new Supreme Court judges during
   his time in office, our correspondent adds.

   Veteran judge

   The court statement said Judge Rehnquist had recently been diagnosed
   with cancer and that he was admitted to the hospital on Friday.

   The judge has had a series of health problems, the Associated Press
   reports.

   He has had surgery to repair a torn knee tendon and has struggled with
   chronic back pain over the years, AP says.

   Judge Rehnquist was named to the Supreme Court by President Richard
   Nixon in 1972 and was elevated to chief justice in 1986 by President
   Ronald Reagan.

   Commentators have speculated that he may retire soon, although he made
   no mention of stepping down when he turned 80 earlier this month.

   Vices 'combine' to harm the heart

   Image of cigarette being stubbed out
   The authors advise smokers quit

   Think twice before lighting up during your coffee break because it
   could do more damage to your heart than either vice alone, according to
   researchers.

   A Greek team Athens Medical School found smoking and caffeine acted
   together to have a harmful effect on arteries and blood flow.

   Scientists have suspected the two might work synergistically rather
   than having just an additive effect on the heart.

   The findings appear in the Journal of the American College of
   Cardiology.

   Risky combination

   There is already a large body of evidence about the heart risks
   associated with smoking.

   Some studies have found caffeine can have a detrimental effect on the
   heart.

   Increasingly, researchers have been looking at whether a combination of
   the two might be even more damaging to the heart.

   The current research had two parts - an acute study of the immediate
   effects of smoking and caffeine in 24 people, and a study that looked
   at the long-term consequences in 160 people.

   In each study, the researchers evaluated the stiffness of the aorta,
   the body's main artery leading from the heart, and the way blood flowed
   in the arteries.

   Image of coffee beans

   It is advisable not to smoke while consuming coffee or other
   caffeine-containing beverages

   Lead author Dr Charalambos Vlachopoulos

   These factors give an indication of cardiovascular disease risk.

   Smoking and caffeine separately had a negative effect on aortic
   stiffness and blood flow.

   In the acute study, the final impact of the two stimuli was larger than
   the sum of the separate impacts of the two stimuli alone.

   The researchers said other studies had shown smoking and caffeine
   combined together had an unfavourable effect on blood pressure and
   increased the risk of heart attacks.

   Kick the habit

   But they added: "The underlying mechanism at the basic level
   responsible for the interactive effect of the two is unclear at this
   stage.

   "Given the frequent combination of smoking and caffeine intake, these
   effects on arterial function may have important implications," they
   said.

   Quitting smoking has got to be the number one priority

   Amanda Salford from ASH

   Lead author Dr Charalambos Vlachopoulos said: "For individuals who have
   not yet quit smoking, it is advisable not to smoke while consuming
   coffee or other caffeine-containing beverages, as very frequently is
   the case.

   "A healthy heart may be able to compensate, at least in the short run,
   for such unfavourable conditions, but for patients with impaired
   cardiac function these effects may be deleterious."

   June Davidson of the British Heart Foundation said: "Large volumes of
   research have confirmed the deeply detrimental effect that smoking has
   on cardiovascular health.

   A common sense approach should be everything in moderation, nothing in
   excess

   Simon Clark from FOREST

   "Previous studies have also suggested that there may be a link between
   drinking lots of coffee and atherosclerosis - 'furring' of the coronary
   arteries.

   "Therefore, it is possible that the combined effect combining smoking
   and caffeine may lead to exacerbated heart health problems."

   She said stopping smoking was the single most important thing someone
   can do to avoid developing heart disease.

   Amanda Salford from Action on Smoking and Health agreed.

   "If people consume large amounts of coffee and smoke then they might
   want to consider what sort of impact that might have on the heart.

   "Quitting smoking has got to be the number one priority."

   A spokeswoman from the British Coffee Association said: "The level of
   caffeine used was equivalent to two to three cups of coffee which the
   general UK population would be unlikely to consumer in one sitting.

   "The researchers themselves are also unclear as to the mechanisms
   involved and indeed state 'our study refers to young, apparently
   healthy adults and results might not be directly extendable to other
   population groups'.

   "Taken in context with the overwhelming scientific evidence it does not
   change the overall position that coffee drinking in moderation,
   four-five cups per day, is perfectly safe for the general population
   and may confer health benefits.

   "This position is supported by the British Heart Foundation."

   Simon Clark, director of the smokers' lobby group FOREST, said:
   "Cigarettes and coffee are a classic combination, like gin and tonic or
   cheese and pickle.

   "A smoker without caffeine is like Posh without Becks. A common sense
   approach should be everything in moderation, nothing in excess."

   Lung cancer threat 'overlooked'

   Lung x-ray
   Early stage lung cancer is more easily treated

   Many people are unaware that lung cancer is such a deadly disease,
   research suggests.

   A survey by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation found 50% of people
   are unaware the disease kills more people in the UK than any other
   cancer.

   The survey also found three-quarters of respondents think breast cancer
   is the leading cause of UK cancer deaths.

   The foundation is calling on the government to back its attempts to
   raise awareness of the disease.

   Lung cancer symptoms

   Chest infections, which won't go away
   Blurred vision
   Feeling more tired than usual
   Coughing up blood
   Skin rash
   Feeling very out of breath
   Losing weight, but not sure why
   Swelling of the face and neck
   Persistent cough

   It says the survey findings demonstrate that lung cancer, although a
   devastating disease, remains the poor relation of other cancers.

   And it says that better public awareness would help to save lives by
   ensuring people seek medical care at an early stage. The disease can be
   difficult to treat once it has reached an advanced stage.

   The survey found the majority of people massively under-estimated lung
   cancer survival rates.

   Some 69% of people surveyed did not appreciate that only 20% of lung
   cancer patients would be alive one year after diagnosis

   Dr Jesme Baird, a medical oncologist and the Foundation's director of
   patient care, said: "We now call on the Department of Health to take a
   lead role in raising the general public's awareness of the gravity of
   this disease.

   "With earlier diagnosis, lung cancer can be successfully treated. But
   unless more people realise the importance of seeing their GP as soon as
   they experience any symptoms, we will never make the in-roads into
   curing lung cancer patients that we truly could.

   "We must give people the knowledge and information they need to seek
   treatment at the earliest possible stage and this simply cannot be
   achieved without major government backing."

   There are 40,000 new lung cancer patients in the UK each year. The
   average time from diagnosis to death is just six months.

   Government response

   A Department of Health spokesperson said it was committed to working
   with charities to raise awareness of lung cancer.

   "We have made significant progress towards the objectives set out in
   the NHS Cancer Plan to reorganise, standardise and rejuvenate cancer
   services so that we compare with the best in Europe.

   "Already over 99% of patients with suspected lung cancer are now seen
   by a specialist within two weeks of being urgently referred by their GP
   and since the 1970s Britain's men have had the world's sharpest fall in
   premature deaths from lung cancer."

   The spokesperson added that smoking was the most common cause of cancer
   and accounts for one-third of all deaths.

   She said 512,000 people had successfully quit smoking using NHS stop
   smoking services since April 2000.

   "The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is also supporting
   clinicians by issuing guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of lung
   cancer - expected to be published early next year."

   Mozambique faces HIV cash dilemma
   By Orla Ryan
   BBC News business reporter in Mozambique

   Ana Maria
   Ana Maria without ARVs...

   It is hard to imagine now, but at the peak of her illness Ana Maria
   Muhai was a skeletal 29 kilos.

   Her husband left her and her neighbours shunned her when they realised
   she was HIV positive, leaving her struggling to support her six
   children.

   Now she is full of fighting talk and enthusiasm, fuelled by the
   knowledge that if she had not found treatment, she would be dead.

   Italian non-governmental organisation Sant Egidio in Maputo treats Ms
   Muhai with generic antiretroviral drugs (ARVs).

   Sant Egidio was a pioneer of this treatment in Mozambique, where it
   launched a pilot project in 2001.

   Ana Maria
   ...Ana Maria in the garden of the Sant Egidio clinic in Maputo

   The trickle of money - and interest - in treatment with ARVs has become
   a flood.

   The Mozambican government is now one of the recipients of US President
   George W Bush's $15bn Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar).

   Pepfar represents a healthy injection of cash into the fight against
   HIV/Aids. Just as importantly, it is the result of US recognition that
   action is urgently needed.

   Spending rules

   But Pepfar cash, however welcome, has attracted controversy.

   It comes with restrictions that prevent the purchase of generics -
   cheaper, copies of brand name drugs.

   Beneficiaries of Pepfar cash are only allowed to buy drugs approved by
   the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This effectively rules out
   the vastly cheaper generic treatments that Ms Muhai benefited from.

   Avertino Barreto, a director in Mozambique's Ministry of Health and one
   of the coordinators of the HIV/Aids effort, welcomes the cash, but says
   the restrictions are unfair.

   With less than $2 per head to spend on drugs, the Ministry's policy has
   always been to buy generics approved by the World Health Organisation
   (WHO).

   The health ministry plans to treat 8,000 people with ARVs by the end of
   this year, using money from its own coffers and from other donors who
   do not have a problem with the generics. By the end of 2008, it hopes
   to treat 128,000 people.

   Safe, cheap drugs?

   Mozambique and other recipient countries have their hands tied by
   Pepfar's conditions.

   Within two years, Pepfar money will account for about 20% of the
   country's HIV/Aids budget, Mr Barreto says.

   Unless the generics have been approved by the US regulator, Mozambique
   will still not be able to use the Pepfar cash to buy ARVs.

   THE PRESIDENT'S MONEY

   President Bush launched the Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) was
   launched in his 2003 State of the Union Address
   The 5-year $15bn initiative will provide ARVs for 2 million
   HIV-infected people
   The money will also be used to prevent 7 million new infections, care
   for 10 million people and build health system capacity in Africa and
   the Caribbean

   Emotions run high when you talk of treatments for Aids, which is
   estimated to kill about 6,000 people each day in Africa.

   Leading pharmaceutical companies argue that they need to charge higher
   prices to justify the billions of dollars they spend on research and
   development, costs which generic drug makers like India's Cipla and
   Ranbaxy do not have to bear.

   There is also a view that generic drugs are unsafe.

   Pepfar, which falls under the auspices of Randall Tobias, a former Eli
   Lilly chief executive, questions the safety of some generic treatments
   and the WHO has withdrawn its approval for some generic treatments.

   Generic drug-maker Cipla, which views the Pepfar ruling as unfair, is
   currently applying for FDA approval.

   Better use of the cash

   Mr Barreto is among the first to say that money spent on drugs is just
   one part of the Pepfar story.

   HOW MUCH DO THE DRUGS COST?

   $140 to $150 for year's supply of generics as negotiated by the Clinton
   Foundation
   $350 to $450 for year's supply of generics as negotiated by other NGOs
   $750 for year's supply of brand name treatment at preferential price
   for developing countries
   $800 to $1000 for month's supply of brand name treatment in first-world
   country

   Source: The International HIV/Aids Alliance

   "We are using most of the money available for training," he says.

   "Training doctors, training nurses, people for planning, people for
   management. ARVs is not a question only of drugs, you need to guarantee
   the system is functioning well," Mr Barreto says.

   US diplomatic sources in Maputo agree.

   "Drugs are an easy way to spend a lot of money," one official said.
   "The difficult part is to put the programme in place, training and
   using the healthcare system."

   He points to the fact that there are only 650 doctors in Mozambique,
   many hospitals lack regular water and electricity supplies and there
   are only three labs where your CD4 count (a blood test which indicates
   whether you need to start taking ARVs) can be tested.

   Mozambique is at a far earlier stage of the HIV epidemic than
   neighbouring countries. Just 14% of its population has the disease,
   compared with 40% in neighbouring Botswana.

   This could justify spending more of the Pepfar money on prevention and
   improved healthcare than on buying ARVs, brand names or generics.

   There is, however, no escaping the importance of treatment.

   "Treatment is a component of prevention," a Maputo-based NGO worker
   says.

   "When you propose testing and you don't have availability of treatment,
   you are giving someone a death sentence."

   Cutting down calories 'is easy'

   Image of a man eating
   Smaller portions don't have to leave you hungry

   It is possible to cut calorie intake without feeling as though you are
   missing out, say experts.

   In a four-week experiment, women who ate 800 fewer calories per day
   felt just as full and satisfied.

   This shows switching to lower fat alternatives or sizing down portions
   need not be difficult, according to the Penn University scientists.

   They described the diet to the North American Association for the Study
   of Obesity.

   Healthy appetite

   The researchers recruited 24 young women aged 19 to 35 to take part in
   their study.

   On two consecutive days of each of the four weeks the women followed a
   diet set by the scientists.

   On these days the same breakfast, lunch and dinner menu was served but
   the foods were varied in energy density (calories) and portion size.

   For example, a meal of pizza and salad was made less calorific by
   incorporating more vegetables and using reduced fat ingredients.

   Image of two meals
   The meal on the left contains fewer calories

   Reducing the calorie content of foods by 30% led to a 23% decrease in
   daily calorie intake.

   Reducing the portion size by 25% led to a 12% decrease in calorie
   intake.

   Despite the large variation in intake, the women rated their hunger or
   fullness the same.

   Lead researcher Dr Barbara Rolls said: "The subjects found the smaller,
   lower energy density meals just as palatable, filling and satisfying as
   the big, high calorie menu items - and they didn't compensate for
   lowered intake on the first day by eating more on the second day of the
   study.

   Tiny portions

   "This shows that even small reductions in the energy density or portion
   size of foods are likely to decrease energy intake.

   If you make enough of these changes you can make a very significant
   drop in calories without even noticing

   Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum

   "The results suggests that home cooks and restaurants could take an
   easy step toward obesity prevention by adding more fruits and
   vegetables and trimming the fat to decrease energy density without
   having to serve tiny portions," she said.

   Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said cutting
   calorie intake by 800 in this way should be easy to sustain and was
   enough to shed unwanted weight.

   "There are certainly changes in our diet that we can make that are
   utterly sustainable and that you would never dream about going back on.

   "Nobody in the world would find it particularly difficult to switch
   from full cream milk to semi skimmed milk in their tea and on their
   cereal.

   "If you like cheese sandwiches you can cut down to half the amount of
   cheese if you grate it rather than using big slabs of cheese. It's just
   the same, if not better.

   "They are certainly simple changes that are completely sustainable and
   if you make enough of these changes you can make a very significant
   drop in calories without even noticing, with no effect on quality of
   life whatsoever."

   Smoking killing millions globally

   Smoking
   Smoking causes illness world-wide

   Smoking killed almost five million people around the world in 2000,
   researchers have calculated.

   Harvard University and the University of Queensland say over half the
   deaths were in smokers aged 30 to 69.

   The research, in the journal Tobacco Control, found premature death
   rates were evenly split between the developed and developing world.

   But men were over three times as likely as women to die an early death
   as a direct result of smoking.

   The researchers used detailed statistical analyses as well as
   population and mortality data to arrive at their figures.

   Smoking deaths

   Cardiovascular disease
   Lung cancer
   Chronic obstructive airways disease

   Three out of four smoking deaths in developed countries and more than
   eight out of 10 in developing countries were in men.

   The leading cause of smoking related death was cardiovascular disease,
   which killed over 1 million people in the developed world and 670,000
   in the developing one.

   Lung cancer, the next biggest smoking killer in the developed world,
   sent over 500,000 people to an early grave.

   Chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), a collective term for
   inflammatory lung disease, such as bronchitis, killed more people in
   the developing world, accounting for 650,000 deaths.

   In Eastern Europe and North America, smoking caused almost one in four
   deaths among people aged between 30 and 69.

   And in developing countries overall, 62% of deaths directly
   attributable to smoking were in people aged between 30 and 69, compared
   with around half in industrialised countries.

   The overall increase in smoking around the world in the last quarter of
   the 20th century accounts for one in 10 of all deaths among adults and
   almost one in five of those among men.

   Future looks bad

   Writing in the journal, the researchers warn that the death toll from
   smoking is likely to continue to rise.

   "The health consequences of smoking will continue to grow unless
   effective interventions and policies that curb and reduce smoking among
   [men] and prevent increases among [women] in these countries are
   implemented."

   Amanda Sandford, of the anti-smoking charity Ash, said the research
   graphically illustrated the "devastating impact" of smoking on
   communities around the globe.

   She said: "The extent of lung cancer, heart disease and chronic
   respiratory disease in millions of people is a direct consequence of
   the ruthless marketing of a deadly drug by the multi-national tobacco
   companies.

   "We must not forget that behind these bald statistics are real people:
   mothers, fathers, friends and other loved-ones who have suffered
   needlessly and who may have lost up to 30 years of life because of
   their addiction.

   "If we are to stem this dreadful tide of mortality in the future,
   governments must implement the global tobacco control treaty without
   delay."

   The tobacco control treaty was negotiated last year by the World Health
   Assembly.

   It requires countries to ban or impose tough restrictions on tobacco
   advertising, sponsorship and promotion within five years.

   It also lays down guidelines on health warnings to be carried on
   cigarette packets, recommends tax increases on tobacco products and
   calls for a crackdown on cigarette smuggling, amongst other measures.

   Personal responsibility

   Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights group Forest, said: "No-one
   disputes the health risks of long-term heavy smoking but before
   politicians and researchers use these figures to demonise all smokers,
   it is important to consider other factors such as the effect of diet,
   including malnutrition, and lack of proper exercise.

   "In Britain smoking rates have dropped from 45% in 1974 to 26% today.

   "The estimated number of smoking-related deaths is falling and smoking
   is already banned in many public places, with more restrictions on the
   way.

   "If we believe that adults should accept a large degree of
   responsibility for their own health, further government intervention to
   curb and reduce smoking would be wholly inappropriate."

   Protein stops heart attack damage

   Lab work
   Protein stops cell death

   A protein produced by the heart during its development could be used to
   repair heart attack damage, research suggests.

   University of Texas scientists worked on mice, but hope their findings
   will eventually lead to new treatment for heart disease.

   The protein, Thymosin beta-4, is already used in clinical trials to
   promote wound healing on the skin.

   The Nature research found it prevented cell death and limited scar
   tissue formation after a heart attack.

   Since the protein is already licensed for clinical use it is likely
   that trials for its use in patients after a heart attack could start
   quickly.

   Professor Jeremy Pearson

   Thymosin beta-4, is produced by embryos during the heart's development.
   It plays a key role in keeping heart cells alive, and ensuring they
   migrate to the right place.

   The Texas team simulated a heart attack in 58 adult mice by tying off
   the coronary artery.

   Half of the animals were given injections of Thymosin beta-4, and the
   rest a control injection of saline.

   The researchers found that Thymosin beta-4 caused fewer cells in the
   affected part of the heart to die, resulting in improved function even
   several weeks after the heart attack.

   They believe the protein triggers changes in cell metabolism to create
   stronger heart muscle cells that can resist the low oxygen conditions
   after a heart attack.

   Lead researcher Professor Deepak Srivastava said it was hoped to launch
   clinical trials using the protein to treat the heart in the near
   future.

   The next step will be to determine the most effective dose, the best
   time to administer it, and how long it after a heart attack it can be
   given and still remain effective.

   Stem cell therapy

   Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director of the British
   Heart Foundation, said current trials were investigating whether stem
   cell therapy - direct injection of cells from the patient's own bone
   marrow into cardiac tissue - can help the heart to heal after a heart
   attack.

   "However, the procedure is not yet proven to be very effective, and the
   way these cells might aid repair is poorly understood," he said.

   "Recently it has been discovered that the heart itself contains stem
   cells, which, if they could be encouraged to form adult heart cells
   following a heart attack, would provide an alternative and potentially
   better way to help healing.

   "The research in this paper provides a substantial step towards this
   goal, by identifying a natural protein that has exactly this effect
   when used in mice.

   "Since the protein is already licensed for clinical use (to promote
   wound healing) it is likely that trials for its use in patients after a
   heart attack could start quickly."

   Gel may destroy cervical cancer

   Image of a smear
   Proteins trigger cells to become cancerous

   A gel to destroy cervical cancer cells and minimise the threat of
   disease is under development.

   The gel, applied directly to the cervix, is designed to block the
   growth of proteins which play a key role in the development of cancer.

   Tests by York University showed that the treatment could induce
   cancerous cells to commit suicide.

   The scientists hope their work will eventually see an end to the need
   for surgery for early-stage disease.

   This is an interesting approach to early stage cervical cancer.

   Dr Richard Sullivan

   They hope clinical trials will be carried out in the UK soon. However,
   they stress that their work is still at a relatively early stage.

   Cervical cancer kills almost 250,000 women worldwide each year.

   It is caused by a common sexually transmitted virus, the human
   papilloma virus (HPV).

   The virus inserts its own DNA into cells on the cervix's surface,
   triggering production of proteins that prevent the cells from dying,
   and turn them cancerous instead.

   The new gel is designed to boost the body's immune system so it is able
   to fight back against HPV, and prevent the build up of the rogue
   proteins.

   Protective layer

   The key ingredients are tiny pieces of genetic material called RNA,
   which enter the cells and disrupt the production of the proteins.

   RNA is easily destroyed by the body, but the gel protects it by
   encasing it in a protective layer of fatty particles called liposomes.

   However, at this stage it is still unclear whether the gel can
   penetrate deep enough into the cervix to kill off early-stage cancers.

   But the researchers hope the gel would work even if the RNA did not get
   into every cancerous cell, by tipping the balance in favour of the
   immune system.

   In theory, the gel would prevent cells from turning cancerous in women
   who already have persistent infections, and could also be used to kill
   tumours.

   It is hoped UK regulators will allow testing on women with precancerous
   cells or early-stage cancers, before the routine surgical removal of
   abnormal cells.

   Similar gels could also one day be developed to treat other cancers on
   accessible surfaces.

   Dr Richard Sullivan, of the charity Cancer Research UK, said: "This is
   an interesting approach to early stage cervical cancer, but before it
   could be used for the routine management of this disease it would need
   to be carefully studied in clinical trials in the UK.

   "In particular, it would need to be compared to current studies of
   removing early stage disease and be shown to be as effective.

   "With the progress being made with developing HPV vaccines, we hope
   that surgical intervention for this disease may soon become a thing of
   the past."

   Cord blood offers leukaemia hope

   Chemotherapy treatment - generic
   Leukaemia patients often find it difficult to find a bone marrow match

   Blood from newborn babies' umbilical cords can be used to treat adults
   with leukaemia, a US-based study says.

   Cord-blood transplants have tended to be used only on children as it
   was not thought to contain enough stem cells to rebuild the blood
   system in adults.

   But the study showed the survival rate for cord-blood transplants was
   the same as for slight mismatched bone marrow - the second best
   alternative treatment.

   The study examined 500 patients, the New England Journal of Medicine
   said.

   Researchers analysed the treatment of leukaemia patients aged 16 to 60
   years old.

   The best survival rate, 33%, was for patients who had transplants from
   matched, unrelated donors.

   It is certainly very interesting and offers hope to patients

   Dr David Grant

   Both cord blood and the mismatched bone marrow transplants from
   unrelated donors had a 22% survival rate, reported the study by the
   International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, University Hospitals of
   Cleveland and New York Blood Center National Cord Blood Program.

   More than 6,000 people are diagnosed with leukaemia in the UK alone
   each year.

   Lead researcher Dr Mary Laughlin said the findings offered hope to
   those patients who cannot find a bone marrow transplant match.

   "Umbilical cords that are normally discarded after birth could provide
   real hope for these patients," she said.

   'Offers hope'

   She said only one in five leukaemia patients can have bone marrow
   transplants from siblings, meaning most are forced to try to find a
   match from bone marrow donor lists.

   "Only a small percentage of patients are lucky enough to find a
   transplant match at a registry, which is why cord-blood transplant is
   so important."

   Dr David Grant, scientific director of the Leukaemia Research Fund,
   welcomed the study.

   "It is certainly very interesting and offers hope to patients," he
   said.

   "In the past doctors have shied away from cord-blood transplant on
   adults as it was not thought to contain enough stem cells."

   However, he warned one problem with cord blood was that it could only
   be collected under stringent conditions.

   There is only one cord blood bank in England.

   Heart risk 'of working when ill'

   Person sneezing
   Heart disease risk was even increased by working with a common cold

   Staff who struggle into work when they are ill risk potentially
   shortening their lives, researchers believe.

   Some workers who do not take time off when ill had twice the rate of
   heart disease, the 10-year study of 10,000 civil servants showed.

   The University College London team found that even working with a
   common cold can be harmful.

   The study said it was the stress from working when ill which caused the
   risk of heart disease.

   Professor Sir Michael Marmot, the head of the study, said workers did
   not realise the damage they were doing.

   Germs

   "So many people force themselves into work when they are not well and
   have little knowledge of the consequences.

   "Far from contributing to their companies or spreading a few germs
   around the office, they could be hastening their own deaths."

   Researchers compared attendance rates with the health records of civil
   servants and found 30% to 40% of those who did not take time off when
   ill had double the incidences of coronary disease.

   If this is correct it confirms what we have been saying - you should
   not go to work when you are ill

   Paul Sellers, of the Trades Union Congress

   The findings will be broadcast on Wednesday in BBC2's The Money
   Programme.

   Dr Charmaine Griffiths, of the British Heart Foundation, welcomed the
   report, saying the findings were supported by previous research, which
   had already shown stress at work could increase the risk of heart
   disease.

   "Different people experience stress in different ways, but people are
   more likely to feel stressed when they feel they have little control
   over their work but have a lot of demands placed on them."

   Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress, said the
   findings were "pretty serious".

   "If this is correct it confirms what we have been saying - you should
   not go to work when you are ill.

   "Some people, particularly in jobs that involve long hours, feel
   compelled to come to work as promotion is directly linked to how long
   you spend in the office.

   Stress

   "We need to get the message across this is not productive and, it
   seems, not healthy."

   But the Institute of Directors played down the link between the
   workplace and heart disease.

   A spokesman said: "It seems to us to be a mistake to link stress and
   heart disease to work.

   "It is the illness which is ultimately causing the increased risk.

   "You could be putting yourself at risk by doing many things when ill,
   for example looking after children."

   And he denied some workers may feel compelled to go to work when ill.

   "Employers realise it is beneficial that if someone is ill they do not
   come to work."

   By Jude Etyang
   First Lady Janet Museveni has attacked the press for downplaying an
   ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention campaign that emphasises sexual abstinence.
   Addressing 600 youths in Kampala, Janet protested an article in The
   Monitor that abstinence was a Western idea that will fail in Uganda.
   The convention was attended by 600 abstainers and not 70,000 as had
   been earlier reported.
   She said the story implied that Africans were like animals in the zoo
   and had no self-control. She urged youth to prove the world wrong by
   saying Ã¢â¬ËnoÃ¢â¬â¢ to sex.
   Ã¢â¬ÅThere is a tendency for people to think that African people have
   no self-control. That they need condoms because they cannot abstain
   from sex. But you have proved to the world that you can say no,Ã¢â¬Â
   Janet said.
   The youth signed Ã¢â¬ËTrue love waits pledgesÃ¢â¬Â to abstain from sex
   till marriage.
   Janet said the press tend to sideline articles about abstinence in
   favour of condoms.
   Janet said it is the Americans who have learnt from UgandaÃ¢â¬â¢s
   experience of AIDS and not the other way round.
   She urged the youth to write in the papers.
   Ã¢â¬ÅTell them that what they are saying is rubbish,Ã¢â¬Â she said.
   Janet said the campaign would continue despite the ridicule.
   Uganda Youth Forum, Life Network and Makerere University were
   represented.

   Cannabis raises risk of psychosis

   Cannabis
   The health effects of cannabis are controversial

   Frequent cannabis use during adolescence and young adulthood raises the
   risk of psychotic symptoms later in life, research suggests.

   The risk was much higher in young people who were already genetically
   vulnerable to developing psychosis.

   It is thought cannabis disrupts the balance of the key mood chemical
   dopamine in the brain.

   The research, by Maastricht University, is published by the British
   Medical Journal.

   It is time to ensure that this information is in the public domain and,
   most importantly, available to teachers who are health educators in
   schools.

   Dinah Morley

   It focused on 2,437 young people aged 14 to 24 who were monitored for
   four years.

   After adjusting for factors such as social and economic status and use
   of other drugs, tobacco, and alcohol, the researchers found cannabis
   use moderately increased the risk of psychotic symptoms.

   However, the effect was much stronger in those with a predisposition
   for psychosis.

   And the researchers said their findings did not support the theory that
   the link was simply down to people with such a predisposition being
   more likely to use cannabis, rather than cannabis in some way making
   psychosis more likely.

   There was little evidence that people who were genetically vulnerable
   to psychosis were any more likely to indulge in drug taking, they
   found.

   Warning on use

   Lead researcher Professor Jim van Os told the BBC News website that
   using cannabis was not a good idea for these people.

   He said: "If there is a family or personal history of mental frailty -
   stay away form it!"

   Martin Barnes, chief executive of the charity DrugScope, said: "The
   research underlines that there are potentially serious health risks
   associated with cannabis use, particularly for young people.

   "The challenge is to ensure that messages on cannabis use are
   understood by teachers and health professionals working with young
   people and conveyed in ways that young people will listen to.

   "Shock tactics alone rarely work, but we need to get across that just
   because you know people who appear to be OK using cannabis, it doesn't
   mean that are or that it will be OK for you.

   "After reclassification, which DrugScope supports, cannabis remains an
   illegal drug. Most young people know that cannabis is illegal and
   harmful, but some may not appreciate what the harms can be."

   Dinah Morley, of the charity Young Minds, said the study added to
   previous work suggesting an association between cannabis and psychosis.

   "It gives support to the emerging understanding that a predisposition
   to psychosis combined with the early abuse of cannabis has an increased
   likelihood of triggering a psychotic illness.

   "Further exploration of why this should happen - in terms of
   neurological development - will be needed.

   "Nevertheless it is time to ensure that this information is in the
   public domain and, most importantly, available to teachers who are
   health educators in schools."

   Disturbing consequences

   Marjorie Wallace, Chief Executive of the mental health charity Sane,
   said: "Britain's position as the cannabis capital of Europe could have
   hidden and disturbing consequences.

   "We need to make the risks known, clamp down on drug dealing in such
   places as playgrounds and hospital wards, and change perceptions of
   cannabis from being a recreational relaxant to a dangerous substance
   for those who are vulnerable."

   Cliff Prior, of the mental health charity Rethink, called for clearer
   warning about use of the drug.

   He said: "Reclassification has sent out a mixed and confusing message.

   "There is a strongly-held view that cannabis is risk-free, reflected in
   the rates of its use among young people.

   "Cannabis is not risk free. We have known for years that using cannabis
   makes the symptoms of schizophrenia far worse in people who already
   have the illness.

   "There is a rapidly growing body of evidence showing that cannabis can
   trigger schizophrenia in people already at risk - and probably even in
   people who should only be low risk."

   Ultrasound scans 'safe for baby'

   Pregnant woman undergoing an ultrasound
   Women can be reassured ultrasounds are safe, say experts

   Pregnant women can be reassured there is no evidence repeated
   ultrasounds will harm their baby, scientists say.

   Ultrasounds have been carried out to check the health and development
   of foetuses for around 30 years.

   But concerns had been raised that repeated scans could be linked to
   growth restrictions in babies.

   However, a study by a researchers at the University of Western
   Australia published in the Lancet, found no evidence of long-term harm.

   It is very reassuring to those of who use ultrasound and, just as
   importantly, to pregnant women

   Sanjay Vyas, Southmead Hospital, Bristol

   In the UK, it is recommended that women have two ultrasound scans -
   where images are created from sound waves - during their pregnancies.

   In cases where there are concerns over the babies development, women
   may undergo more.

   Comparison

   The Australian researchers had carried out a study in 1993 which
   suggested there could be a link between repeated ultrasound scans in
   late pregnancy (after 18 weeks) and growth restrictions among newborn
   babies.

   In this latest study, they looked at the children's development up
   until the age of eight.

   Physical and developmental checks were carried out on 2,700 children at
   the ages of one, two, three, five and eight.

   Half had been exposed to up to five ultrasound scans while in the womb,
   while the rest had had only one ultrasound exposure before birth.

   It was found that the physical sizes of the children were similar in
   both groups from the age of one upwards.

   There were also no significant differences between the groups in
   relation to their speech, language, behaviour or neurological
   development.

   Dr John Newnham, who led the research, said: "Exposure to multiple
   prenatal ultrasound examinations from 18 weeks' gestation onwards might
   be associated with a small effect on foetal growth.

   "But is followed in childhood by growth and measures of developmental
   outcome similar to those in children who had received a single prenatal
   scan."

   The researchers said uncertainty remained about suggestions repeated
   ultrasound exposure was linked to an increase in the number of
   left-handed babies born, but said the connection could be "nothing more
   than chance".

   'Scanner must be trained'

   Sanjay Vyas, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Southmead
   Hospital, Bristol welcomed the Australian research.

   He said: "It is very reassuring to those of who use ultrasound and,
   just as importantly, to pregnant women.

   "There are three things pregnant women worry about when they are
   undergoing any kind of procedure; what will the results be, what can't
   be seen and will having this test harm my baby.

   "Some women also ask if ultrasounds are like an X-ray, which they
   associate with possible harm."

   But Mr Vyas said women should check the person carrying out the
   ultrasound was trained, so they could be confident any problems would
   be detected and that something innocuous would not be misinterpreted.

   Migraines 'double' risk of stroke

   Image of a woman in pain
   Women on the pill who have migraines could be at very high risk

   People who have migraines are twice as likely to have a stroke as
   others, researchers estimate.

   Experts in Canada and the US looked at 14 studies that had shown a link
   to quantify the exact risk involved.

   Migraines roughly doubled the stroke risk, while migraines with 'auras'
   more so than those without interruptions to the sufferers' vision.

   Women with migraines who were on the oral contraceptive pill appeared
   to be at particular risk, reserach found.

   Higher risk groups

   The increased risk of stroke is probably down to the reduced blood flow
   to the brain which usually occurs in a migraine, the researchers
   believe.

   The studies looked at by Dr Ali Samii, neurologist at the University of
   Washington, and his colleagues, suggest the risk of stroke for migraine
   sufferers is 2.16 times that for non-sufferers.

   You are far more likely to get a stroke from smoking. That's the big
   risk factor.

   Dr Anne MacGregor, director of clinical research at the City of London
   Migraine Clinic

   Those who have migraines with auras are 2.27 times as likely to suffer
   a stroke and in those with migraines without auras the risk is
   increased 1.86 times.

   Three of the studies showed that women migraine sufferers who were also
   taking oral contraceptives were up to eight times more likely to suffer
   a stroke than those not taking the pill.

   The researchers said the latter results were slightly at odds with
   other studies, which suggest a smaller degree of increased risk for
   such women - about double.

   Therefore, they say much more research should be carried out to
   establish what the risk is.

   "Given that the use of oral contraceptives is prevalent among young
   women, the potential risk of stroke among women with migraine who are
   also users of oral contraceptives must be further investigated," they
   said in their paper which is due to be published in the British Medical
   Journal.

   'No cause for alarm'

   They said as many as a quarter of women in their mid to late 30s
   experience migraines.

   Dr Anne MacGregor, director of clinical research at the City of London
   Migraine Clinic and acting general secretary of the International
   Headache Society, said: "There is no doubt that there is a relationship
   between migraine and stroke, and that the risk is greater with aura
   migraines and women on the pill. That is indisputable.

   "What is not known is the exact risk and I am not convinced that a
   meta-analysis of studies, such as this, will come up with the answer."

   She said there were too many other factors that could skew the results,
   such as how the different studies were carried out.

   Dr MacGregor said there were already guidelines recommending against
   contraceptive pill use by women with aura migraines.

   Women with non-aura migraines could try using the pill but should come
   off it if they have any problems.

   In some women the pill can even help with migraines, she said.

   "We do not want people with migraine to think they are at high risk of
   having a stroke.

   "The absolute numbers are very small. You are far more likely to get a
   stroke from smoking. That's the big risk factor."

   The Stroke Association agreed with the call for more research.

   A spokesman added: "Other risk factors such as high blood pressure and
   smoking may also have a role.

   "Migraine sufferers who may have such risk factors and are intending to
   take oral contraception should be advised accordingly.

   "Anyone who has concerns about this issue should discuss them with
   their GP."

   Plans to tackle bird flu outbreak

   Image of worker on Thai farm hit by bird flu
   The infection is spread by birds

   The UK is drawing up plans to deal with a possible outbreak of bird
   flu.

   The Department of Health has confirmed proposals under consideration
   include providing anti-viral drugs to key health workers and emergency
   services.

   Schools and cinemas in affected areas could be closed, and victims'
   families quarantined.

   There are concerns bird flu could kills millions globally if it mutates
   to acquire the ability to pass from human to human.

   History has taught us to take flu pandemics very seriously.

   Professor Maria Zambon

   Flu's deadly weaponry

   At present, the virus can only be contracted by direct contact with
   infected animals.

   However, it has shown an alarming ability to evolve at rapid speed, and
   the World Health Organization has warned that this ability means that
   the virus is highly likely at some point to pose a serious global
   threat.

   More than 30 people died from avian influenza in Asia this year, after
   the disease swept through the bird population.

   Other plans under consideration by the UK authorities include
   restricting travel to and from affected areas, health screening at
   ports and cancelling large sporting events, like football matches, to
   slow spread of the virus down.

   A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The overarching UK plan
   is currently being brought up to date and as part of this we're
   considering the role of anti-virals.

   "The plan will be published once this review is completed."

   Serious threat

   The World Health Organization is hosting an international conference to
   discuss the threat posed by bird flu this week in Geneva.

   Professor Maria Zambon, a virologist and head of the Health Protection
   Agency's Influenza Laboratory, said: "We are worried about the extent
   of avian influenza in south east Asia, and history has taught us to
   take flu pandemics very seriously."

   She said that if the virus acquired the ability to pass from human to
   human, then up to 1% of the population might die in a serious outbreak.

   The young and elderly are most likely to be vulnerable.

   She warned that at present not enough vaccines were available to cope
   with a major outbreak.

   Two leading pharmaceutical firms, Aventis-Pasteur and Chiron Corp, say
   they are due to start human testing of a bird flu vaccine in the near
   future.

   Dr Douglas Fleming, Director of the Royal College of GPs' Birmingham
   Research Unit said: "The idea that an outbreak may happen this year,
   next year, or in the next 10 years, is speculative.

   "But we should all welcome the fact the government is planning in case
   it does happen.

   "I believe our best hope as far as pandemic management is concerned is
   to stockpile anti-virals.

   "The prospect of a vaccine becoming available, in sufficient time and
   sufficient quantity to curtail a pandemic, seems much less likely."

   Infection link to heart attacks

   Tired woman
   Excessive tiredness could be a warning sign

   Common respiratory and urinary tract infections play a role in
   triggering heart attacks and strokes, a study of 40,000 medical records
   suggests.

   Infections such as bronchitis, pneumonia and cystitis raised the risk
   of a heart attack fivefold, and of a stroke threefold, for the period a
   patient was ill.

   The blame has been pinned on inflammation caused by the infections.

   The research, funded by several leading research bodies, is published
   in the New England Journal of Medicine.

   If a patient has a history of heart disease and the weather is
   particularly cold then they should try to stay indoors

   Dr Douglas Fleming, Royal College of GPs

   Scientists discovered the risk of heart attack and stroke was
   substantially higher in the three days after a respiratory tract
   infection.

   The likelihood of having either then decreased gradually over the
   following weeks.

   Researcher Professor Patrick Vallance, of University College London,
   said the work showed the timing of a heart attack was not always
   random.

   He told the BBC News website: "After the age of 50, we all have some
   degree of furring up of the arteries, but most of the time it sits
   there fairly harmlessly.

   "However, during infection stable deposits become unstable and may
   break off, causing the blockages that may lead to a heart attack or a
   stroke."

   Changing risk

   Professor Vallance said the idea that a patient's risk was constant was
   misleading. In fact, the risk fluctuated all the time.

   He said the latest study suggested that extra care should be given to
   patients who were likely to be experiencing an inflammatory response -
   for instance those who were undergoing abdominal surgery.

   Dr Liam Smeeth, lead researcher on the project, said: "This knowledge
   will open up new avenues for research and discovery.

   "Armed with the information we have found, we can begin to develop new
   strategies to reduce the occurrence of heart attacks and strokes."

   The team also investigated whether vaccinations, including flu and
   tetanus, increased the risk of heart attacks or strokes. They found no
   heightened risk.

   Dr Douglas Fleming, from the Royal College of GPs, said: "It has always
   been the case that December is the key month for increased cases of
   bronchitis - particularly in children and the elderly.

   "There has been a lot of argument on whether infections may precipitate
   heart attacks and it is true that, looking at the figures, the risk is
   slightly increased - but I would stress this is only a slight increase
   and patients should not be unduly worried."

   He added: "As a rule, patients with slight bronchitis do not need to
   see their GP, however if their bronchitis is a problem then they should
   make an appointment.

   "If a patient has a history of heart disease and the weather is
   particularly cold then they should try to stay indoors."

   The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical
   Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.

   Pacemaker stops epilepsy deaths

   Image of a heart monitor
   The device spots dangerously irregular heart rates

   Devices to monitor and correct abnormal heart beats could prevent
   unexpected epilepsy deaths, researchers suggest.

   As many as 1,000 cases of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP)
   occur each year in the UK.

   Some are thought to be due to spells of irregular heart rate during
   seizures, which can be missed by routine checks.

   An implant can continuously monitor the heart and show which patients
   need a pacemaker, the University College London team told the Lancet.

   We think it will prevent some but not all SUDEPs

   Lead researcher Professor John Duncan

   'Epilepsy killed my daughter'

   Professor John Duncan's team at the Institute of Neurology fitted 20
   epilepsy patients with the loop recording device, which monitored heart
   rhythms for up to 22 months.

   Heart rhythms were recorded during 377 of a total of 3,377 seizures
   reported by the patients.

   The implants, inserted just above the heart, picked up eight episodes
   of serious drops in heart rate during the seizures.

   Four patients, who were subsequently given pacemakers, all experienced
   periods in which the heartbeat ceased temporarily or went very slowly.

   Sudden deaths

   In three of these instances the heart irregularity would have been
   fatal had they not been fitted with the pacemaker, the researchers
   believe.

   Professor Duncan said: "Most of the cardiac events detected by the
   device would not have been picked up during routine ECG monitoring,
   meaning these loop recorders offer a substantial improvement in
   spotting potentially fatal heart arrhythmias in these patients.

   Ultimately, the goal is to get to the bottom of what is causing these
   sudden unexpected deaths and stop them from happening

   Margaret Thomas of the National Society for Epilepsy

   "This device not only offers them a much longer period of monitoring,
   but it enables them to continue with their everyday activities rather
   than spending a week in a hospital."

   He and his team plan to study people with different types of epilepsy
   to further define which groups might benefit from a pacemaker.

   "We think it will prevent some but not all SUDEPs.

   "It may be that some cases of SUDEP are caused by cessation of
   breathing being the problem and a heart pacemaker would not prevent
   that," he said.

   Margaret Thomas of the National Society for Epilepsy, which funded the
   research, said: "This research is an important step in the right
   direction.

   "Ultimately, the goal is to get to the bottom of what is causing these
   sudden unexpected deaths and stop them from happening.

   "If it is that some are caused by some sort of heart function
   abnormality then whatever we can do to remedy this has to be of
   benefit."

   'Funding vital'

   Jane Hanna, Director of Epilepsy Bereaved, said: "Two years ago, we
   found that up to 400 of 1,000 deaths a year were potentially avoidable
   through access to basic epilepsy services to prevent seizures, and this
   new research adds further hope that potentially fatal epilepsy seizures
   are treatable.

   "We hope that vital funding is forthcoming to ensure access to any
   life-saving treatment, whether it is having an annual review to check
   seizures or having a pacemaker."

   Simon Wigglesworth of Epilepsy Action said: "To achieve the better
   standards for epilepsy care set out in the NICE guidance, immediate
   inward investment by the government is needed, to increase the number
   of epilepsy nurses and neurologists in the country."

   HIV can be flushed out of hiding

   Image of HIV-infected cell
   The virus can hide from attack

   A protein produced by immune cells could lead to more effective
   treatments for HIV, US researchers hope.

   While powerful anti-HIV drugs exist, the virus has learned how to lie
   dormant in the body and escape their attack.

   Now virologists at Thomas Jefferson University have found the protein
   called interleukin-7 can bring some strains of HIV back out of hiding.

   Their findings appear in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

   The only way we are going to cure this disease is by getting rid of the
   latent virus.

   Investigator Dr Roger Pomerantz

   Therapy with a similar interleukin (IL), IL-5, has already shown some
   promise in rendering HIV susceptible to attack.

   Dr Roger Pomerantz and his colleagues at Jefferson's Center for Human
   Virology and Biodefence believe a cocktail of interleukins and anti-HIV
   drugs might be the best way to eradicate the virus.

   They took blood from HIV-positive patients who had been taking a
   combination of anti-HIV drugs known as highly active antiretroviral
   therapy (HAART).

   All of the patients had undetectable levels of HIV.

   The scientists then tested the effect of different drugs and proteins
   to see what would stimulate the latent virus the best.

   Exposed

   IL-7 was the most effective, particularly with respect to specific
   strains of HIV that did not respond so well to IL-2.

   Dr Pomerantz said: "We have tried to find an approach where we can
   stimulate HIV out of its latent state so it can be killed by antiviral
   drugs and the immune system.

   "The only way we are going to cure this disease is by getting rid of
   the latent virus.

   "It's a little bit like treating cancer. You give induction treatment
   to stop the viral load and then use this approach to get rid of the
   residual disease, much like chemotherapy."

   He said that the interleukin treatment appeared to be safe and that,
   hopefully, his team would get approval to use it as a therapy in HIV
   patients within the next year or two.

   But he said in order to eradicate all of the virus, it was likely that
   many drugs would need to be used in combination.

   "We may have to combine IL-2 with IL-7 and other agents to get to the
   reservoirs of the virus," he said.

Income Inequality or Effort Inequality?

   [INS: :INS]

   The Democrats are right, there are two Americas. The America that works
   and the America that doesn’t. The America that contributes and the
   America that doesn’t. It’s not the haves and the have nots, it’s the
   dos and the don’ts. Some people do their duty as Americans, obey the
   law, support themselves, contribute to society and others don’t. That’s
   the divide in America .

   It’s not about income inequality, it’s about civic irresponsibility.
   It’s about a political party that preaches hatred, greed and
   victimization in order to win elective office. It’s about a political
   party that loves power more than it loves its country.

   That’s not invective, that’s truth, and it’s about time someone said
   it.

   The politics of envy was on proud display a couple weeks ago when
   President Obama pledged the rest of his term to fighting “income
   inequality.” He noted that some people make more than other people,
   that some people have higher incomes than others, and he says that’s
   not just. That is the rationale of thievery.

   The other guy has it, you want it, Obama will take it for you. Vote
   Democrat. That is the philosophy that produced Detroit.

   It is the electoral philosophy that is destroying America. It conceals
   a fundamental deviation from American values and common sense because
   it ends up not benefiting the people who support it, but a betrayal.

   The Democrats have not empowered their followers, they have enslaved
   them in a culture of dependence and entitlement, of victim-hood and
   anger instead of ability and hope. The president’s premise – that you
   reduce income inequality by debasing the successful–seeks to deny the
   successful the consequences of their choices and spare the unsuccessful
   the consequences of their choices. Because, by and large, income
   variations in society are a result of different choices leading to
   different consequences.

   Those who choose wisely and responsibly have a far greater likelihood
   of success, while those who choose foolishly and irresponsibly have a
   far greater likelihood of failure.

   Success and failure usually manifest themselves in personal and family
   income. You choose to drop out of high school or to skip college – and
   you are apt to have a different outcome than someone who gets a diploma
   and pushes on with purposeful education.

   You have your children out of wedlock and life is apt to take one
   course; you have them within a marriage and life is apt to take another
   course. Most often in life our destination is determined by the course
   we take.

   My doctor, for example, makes far more than I do. There is significant
   income inequality between us. Our lives have had an inequality of
   outcome, but, our lives also have had an in equality of effort. While
   my doctor went to college and then devoted his young adulthood to
   medical school and residency, I got a job in a restaurant. He made a
   choice, I made a choice, and our choices led us to different outcomes.
   His outcome pays a lot better than mine. Does that mean he cheated and
   Barack Obama needs to take away his wealth? No, it means we are both
   free men in a free society where free choices lead to different
   outcomes.

   [INS: :INS]

   It is not inequality Barack Obama intends to take away, it is freedom.
   The freedom to succeed, and the freedom to fail. There is no true
   option for success if there is no true option for failure. The pursuit
   of happiness means a whole lot less when you face the punitive hand of
   government if your pursuit brings you more happiness than the other
   guy. Even if the other guy sat on his arse and did nothing. Even if the
   other guy made a lifetime’s worth of asinine and short sighted
   decisions.

   Barack Obama and the Democrats preach equality of outcome as a right,
   while completely ignoring inequality of effort.

   The simple Law of the Harvest – as ye sow, so shall ye reap – is
   sometimes applied as, “The harder you work, the more you get.”

   Obama would turn that upside down. Those who achieve are to be punished
   as enemies of society and those who fail are to be rewarded as wards of
   society. Entitlement will replace effort as the key to upward mobility
   in American society if Barack Obama gets his way. He seeks a lowest
   common denominator society in which the government besieges the
   successful and productive to foster equality through mediocrity. He and
   his party speak of two Americas, and their grip on power is based on
   using the votes of one to sap the productivity of the other. America is
   not divided by the differences in our outcomes, it is divided by the
   differences in our efforts.

   It is a false philosophy to say one man’s success comes about
   unavoidably as the result of another man’s victimization.

   What Obama offered was not a solution, but a separatism. He fomented
   division and strife, pitted one set of Americans against another for
   his own political benefit. That’s what socialists offer. Marxist class
   warfare wrapped up with a bow. Two Americas, coming closer each day to
   proving the truth to Lincoln’s maxim that a house divided against
   itself cannot stand.

   “Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you
   respond to it.”

     NIH Bans Outside Consulting
   Agency proposes policy to manage conflict-of-interest concerns
   SUSAN R. MORRISSEY




                                                                  Zerhouni
                                                                 NIH PHOTO

   In an unexpected move, officials at the National Institutes of Health
   say they will place a yearlong moratorium on all outside consulting
   activities between NIH employees and pharmaceutical and biotechnology
   companies. The proposed policy is a response to an ongoing
   investigation by Congress of conflict-of-interest problems at the
   agency (C&EN, Dec. 15, 2003, page 10).
   At a congressional hearing in June, NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni
   presented a set of proposed changes to the agency’s
   conflict-of-interest polices to the subcommittee, but he resisted calls
   to impose a complete ban on outside consulting activities (C&EN, June
   28, page 30).
   As the agency proceeds with its review of the situation, Raynard S.
   Kington, deputy director of NIH, wrote in a memo to agency employees on
   Sept. 24 that “we have identified vulnerabilities in our system that
   give us pause. It is clear to us that if these activities are to
   continue, we will need a substantially expanded system of oversight to
   assure Congress and the public that conflicts of interest are
   prevented.”
   The Office of Government Ethics still must approve the ban before it
   goes into effect. The moratorium will give NIH time to complete its
   review, develop an effective way to track outside activities, and
   provide better training programs for staff, according to Kington.

High Doses Of Vitamin E Found to Raise Risk of Dying

   By Rob Stein
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Thursday, November 11, 2004; Page A01

   High doses of Vitamin E, which millions of people take to protect
   themselves against heart attacks, Alzheimer's disease and other
   ailments, appear to actually increase the overall risk of dying,
   researchers reported yesterday.

   A new analysis of data from 19 studies involving nearly 136,000 people
   concluded that the overall risk of dying began to increase at the dose
   in a typical single capsule of Vitamin E, and that the more Vitamin E
   people took, the more their risk of death rose. Someone taking 400
   international units of Vitamin E a day for five years, for example,
   would face a 5 percent higher risk of dying, the researchers found.

                         ^_____Special Report^_____

   • FDA Unveils New Rules For Supplement Labels (The Washington Post, Nov
   5, 2004)
   • Antioxidant Pills Questioned, Again (The Washington Post, Oct 12,
   2004)
   • Deep Purple (The Washington Post, Oct 6, 2004)
   • Overfed, Undernourished (The Washington Post, Sep 21, 2004)
   • Accept No Substitutes (The Washington Post, Aug 25, 2004)
   • Dietary Supplements

   The study found no increased risk from lower doses, particularly at
   doses of 200 international units or below, and perhaps even a benefit.
   A typical multivitamin contains 30 to 60 international units of Vitamin
   E.

   Although the study did not examine how high-dose Vitamin E might
   increase the risk of death, other studies have suggested that the
   substance may boost the danger of heart attacks and strokes, perhaps by
   affecting blood clotting or blocking the beneficial effects of other
   nutrients, the researchers said.

   Whatever the mechanism, the findings indicate that no one should take
   high doses regularly and that current guidelines for what is considered
   a safe maximum daily intake should be lowered, the researchers said in
   a study presented at an American Heart Association meeting in New
   Orleans.

   "A lot of people take vitamins because they believe it will benefit
   their health in the long term and prolong life," said Edgar R. Miller
   III, an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University
   School of Medicine, who led the research. "But our study shows that use
   of high-dose Vitamin E supplements certainly did not prolong life but
   was associated with a higher risk of death."

   The findings are the latest in a series of recent findings undermining
   the theory that "antioxidant" substances may provide powerful
   protection against a host of illnesses. Evidence had suggested that
   vitamins and other compounds found naturally in many foods might reduce
   the risk of heart disease, cancer and other illnesses by preventing
   unstable oxygen molecules known as free radicals from damaging DNA.
   That has prompted many Americans to take supplements containing high
   doses of antioxidants, including Vitamin E.

   In 2003, Americans spent $710 million on Vitamin E, making it the
   second most popular individual vitamin, behind Vitamin C, according to
   the Nutrition Business Journal, which tracks industry trends.

   But when researchers have attempted to give antioxidants to prevent
   disease, the results largely have been disappointing, and sometimes
   alarming. Beta carotene, for example, was found to increase rather than
   decrease the risk of lung cancer.

   The latest study suggests that may be true for Vitamin E, as well,
   experts said.

Reality TV Check

   By Sally Squires
   Tuesday, October 19, 2004; Page HE01

   If you want to see the emotional and physical toll that diets,
   deprivation and being pushed to physical extremes can take -- and we
   don't blame you if you don't -- tune in to "The Biggest Loser," the
   newest reality television show.

   In tonight's episode, a dozen desperate obese men and women begin a
   personal weight-loss odyssey on NBC. "I don't take my shirt off for my

   Over nine shows, viewers will watch as two teams of three men and three
   women (weighing a little more than 1,500 pounds per team at the
   beginning) live together on a ranch in Malibu. Rather than consider
   what weight loss plan might work best for every individual, the script
   calls for each team to be assigned to one of two diets. Both limit
   portions. One regimen is based on the glycemic index -- which takes
   into account how much a food raises blood sugar levels. The other
   focuses on eating six small meals per day.

   Two personal trainers with nearly opposite philosophies put the
   would-be losers through physical paces so grueling (at least during the
   first show) that it reduces some to tears. One contestant vomits.

   Oh, yes, and hovering in the background are glass-fronted
   refrigerators, labeled with each contestant's name and filled with
   their favorite high-calorie foods. The team that loses less weight each
   week must vote a member off the show. The last remaining contestant
   will win a $250,000 prize.

   And what do leading weight-loss experts think about this exercise?

   "Very humiliating," said Albert Stunkard, professor of psychiatry at
   the University of Pennsylvania and a pioneer in the study of obesity.

   "Both cruel and counterproductive," said Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of
   the New York Obesity Research Center, St. Luke-Roosevelt Hospital,
   chairman of the National Institutes of Health Obesity Guidelines panel
   and a member of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines Committee.

   "Competition may be a benefit to some people, but it's not a benefit
   when it damages self-esteem," said Thomas A. Wadden, director of the
   Weight and Eating Disorders Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania.
   "If you slip up, you can feel doubly bad because you're letting down
   the team."

   Having said all that, a few things can be learned from this show:

Around Tweeners' Wrists, a Fad of Many Colors

   By Fern Shen
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Sunday, December 12, 2004; Page A01

   Clutching his dollar bills, his reedy voice trembling, 10-year-old
   Sergio Contijoch had an urgent question to ask the clerks at a
   Rockville girls' clothing boutique one weekday last week.

   "Do you have the bracelets?" the Gaithersburg boy said, gravely. "The
   pink ones and the blue ones?"
   More than 27 million of Lance Armstrong's "LiveStrong" wristbands have
   been sold, with most of the money going to cancer research. (Franck
   Prevel -- AP)

   Every 10 minutes or so, the phone at Cloud 9 rang with people asking
   the same question. From the moment school let out, boys and girls about
   Sergio's age (accompanied by their wallet-packing mothers) mobbed the
   store in search of bracelets. During one recent four-week period, it
   sold more than 10,000 of them.

   Sergio grinned with relief when told the store still had the bracelets;
   he purchased five of them, at $2.50 apiece. Also relieved was Liliana
   Torres and her 10-year-old son, Gabriel. Knowing a fresh shipment of
   bracelets had come in, Gabriel "brought me flying here, to get the blue
   one," said the Germantown mother. "I almost ran out of gas."

   Why all the desperation for these trinkets, basically fancy rubber
   bands? The ones at Cloud 9 are stamped with slogans showing support for
   people with breast cancer (the pink ones) and autism (the light blue
   ones). Did Sergio buy them to support these causes? Did the
   fourth-grader buy the dark blue one he also wears to show he wants to
   "Stand Strong for Israel"?

   The boy's explanation was pretty much the definition of a schoolyard
   fad.

   "Every kid I know has at least one. Most of them have 10 or 11," Sergio
   said. "It's fun to try and get all the colors."

   "The mothers always ask if [the money] is going to a good cause," said
   clerk Rebecca Hartman. "The kids never ask."

   "Awareness bracelets," as they're called, are surfing along in the wake
   of the monster success of cyclist Lance Armstrong's yellow "LiveStrong"
   model. Since May, more than 27 million of the yellow bracelets have
   been sold through the Lance Armstrong Foundation, with most of the
   money going to cancer research. Emblazoned with the mantra of the
   cancer survivor and six-time Tour de France winner, they were the
   fashion-forward accessory of the summer.

   But now yellow has given way to the virtual rainbows that adorn the
   wrists of many tweens -- with a color for just about every cause. What
   bumper stickers are to the back of a car, these bracelets are to the
   human wrist.

   There's a pink "Sharing the Promise" band for the Susan G. Komen Breast
   Cancer Foundation. There's the hotter-pink Melissa Etheridge "Be Strong
   MLE" bracelet, also for breast cancer. (Lots of pink ones for breast
   cancer.) There's lime green to fight medical malpractice, royal blue to
   encourage bone marrow donations, cornflower blue for colorectal cancer.
   College groups, high school sports teams and elementary schools have
   all ordered batches of them.

   Kids are trading them with friends, mothers are stuffing them into
   birthday goody-bags, private school kids are breaking the rules to wear
   them. ("We can only have one at most, but a lot of kids hide them under
   their sweaters," said Natalie Abrams, 10, who goes to the McLean School
   and wears eight when she can get away with it.)

   "It's crazy how this has taken off -- everybody's got one for whatever
   they're peddling," said Joel Spivak, a spokesman for the Campaign for
   Tobacco-Free Kids. (That group sells a red bracelet imprinted with
   "1200," the number of Americans who die every day from tobacco use or
   second-hand smoke exposure.)

   "I have four. I keep mine on all the time, when I sleep and take a
   shower. And it's not just for fashion either," said Paige Keller, 10,
   of Rockville, who knows a kid in the neighborhood diagnosed with
   autism. One of her four bracelets is stamped with "Embrace, Engage,
   Enable, Expand, Express" the motto adopted by a group advocating autism
   education and research.

Findings on Caesarean Deliveries Rekindle Debate

Women Face Small Risk of Complications in Vaginal Birth After C-Section,
Study Shows

   By Rob Stein
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, December 15, 2004; Page A18

   Women who have delivered a baby by Caesarean section face a small risk
   of complications that could endanger the baby if they attempt a vaginal
   delivery the next time, a large new study has found.

   The findings, the most definitive data so far on the safety of trying
   to deliver vaginally after a Caesarean, immediately rekindled debate on
   the controversial issue.

   Proponents of attempting a vaginal delivery said the findings should
   give doctors and women confidence that the risk is relatively low and
   that most women and their babies will not experience major problems.
   But other experts said the findings underscore the dangers of
   attempting vaginal birth after a Caesarean and provide new evidence
   that women should not be encouraged to do so.

   Experts on both sides, however, said the findings provide necessary
   information for women to make an informed decision on whether they are
   willing to accept the risk.

   "Some people will look at the risk and say, 'That's a really low
   number. I'm willing to accept the risk.' Others will say, 'There's no
   way,' " said Michael F. Greene, director of maternal-fetal medicine at
   Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wrote an editorial
   accompanying the study in this week's issue of the New England Journal
   of Medicine. "That's the value of this kind of study. Risk is in the
   eye of the beholder."

   A Caesarean section is a surgical procedure that is performed to
   deliver a baby, usually when the mother or child is experiencing a
   complication that puts one or both of them at risk. For years, some
   doctors and advocates of vaginal birth have encouraged women who had
   one Caesarean to try to avoid the cost, added recovery time and
   possible surgical complications by attempting to deliver their next
   child vaginally.

   But the rate at which women had been attempting a vaginal birth after
   Caesarean, known as VBAC, began falling in the late 1990s following
   reports of life-threatening complications, most notably ruptures of the
   uterus. In recent years, many smaller hospitals nationwide have stopped
   performing the procedure because of the costs of malpractice insurance
   and having the necessary doctors available in case of an emergency.
   That has caused frustration among some women who wanted to attempt a
   vaginal delivery but were unable to find a doctor or hospital willing
   to offer that option.

   The new study was organized and funded by the National Institute of
   Child Health and Human Development to provide better data on the risks
   associated with VBAC. Researchers compared 17,898 women who attempted a
   vaginal birth and 15,801 who had another Caesarean at 19 academic
   medical centers nationwide.

   Of the women who tried to deliver vaginally, 124 -- less than 1 percent
   -- experienced a ruptured uterus, and seven babies suffered brain
   damage from a lack of oxygen because of labor complications, including
   two who died. Women who attempted a vaginal birth were also more likely
   to develop an infection of the uterine lining. No serious problems
   occurred among women who had repeat Caesareans.

   Overall, among the women who attempted a vaginal birth, the risk of
   brain injury or death for the baby from a uterine rupture was about 1
   in 2,000 deliveries, the researchers reported.

   Mark B. Landon, a professor and vice chairman in the department of
   obstetrics and gynecology at Ohio State University who led the study,
   said the findings show that VBAC generally can be safe.

   "At this level of risk, I think clearly many women will still opt for
   attempting a vaginal birth after a Caesarean," he said. "I think many
   women have been dissuaded from VBAC because of inadequate counseling
   concerning the magnitude of the risk. Hopefully this will help women
   make a more informed decision."

   Bruce L. Flamm, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the
   University of California at Irvine, agreed.

   "The bottom line is that this study shows that VBAC is safe in an
   appropriate setting," he said. "My feeling is that it should be a
   patient's choice."

   But other experts said the findings probably would contribute to
   continuing the trend of more women opting for repeat Caesareans.

   "I think it will keep going in the direction it is," said W. Benson
   Harer Jr., medical director of the Riverside County Regional Medical
   Center in Moreno Valley, Calif., and a past president of the American
   College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. "The risk they found in
   this study is probably as good as you could hope."

Federal Officials To Expand List Of Who Should Get Flu Vaccine

   By Rob Stein
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Saturday, December 18, 2004; Page A02

   Federal health officials, concerned that scarce flu vaccine may go
   unused, yesterday announced plans to relax the guidelines on who should
   receive shots after one last push to encourage Americans who are at
   highest risk from the flu to get vaccinated.

   Beginning Jan. 3, people ages 50 to 64 and those in close contact with
   people at high risk should also be allowed to get the vaccine where
   enough vaccine is available, the federal Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention said.

   Q. What is avian flu?
   A. Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A
   strains of the influenza virus. The disease, which was first identified
   in Italy more than 100 years ago, occurs worldwide.
   Q. Is avian flu contagious?
   A. Yes. All birds are thought to be susceptible to infection with avian
   influenza, though some species are more resistant to infection than
   others. The first documented infection of humans with an avian
   influenza virus occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when the H5N1 strain
   caused severe respiratory disease in 18 humans, of whom 6 died.
   Q. What are the symptoms of avian flu?
   A. Published information on human infection is limited to studies of
   the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak. Symptoms included fever, sore throat,
   cough and, in several of the fatal cases, severe respiratory distress
   secondary to viral pneumonia.
   Q. How do you treat avian flu?
   A. The quarantining of infected farms and destruction of infected or
   potentially exposed flocks are standard control measures aimed at
   preventing spread to other farms and eventual establishment of the
   virus in a countrys poultry population.
   Q. How can you protect yourself against avian flu?
   A. Workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks must be protected,
   by proper clothing and equipment, against infection. These workers
   should also receive antiviral drugs as a prophylactic measure.
   Q. How effective is the vaccine?
   A. Vaccination of persons at high risk of exposure to infected poultry,
   using existing vaccines effective against currently circulating human
   influenza strains, can reduce the likelihood of co-infection of humans
   with avian and influenza strains.

   The move followed new recommendations from the Advisory Committee on
   Immunization Practices, which advises the agency. The panel also said
   that as of that date, state and local health officials who think they
   have enough vaccine to meet remaining demand from high-risk individuals
   should be free to offer it to any others they deem appropriate.

   The CDC recommended in October that only those 65 and older, the
   chronically ill, health care workers, children younger than 2 and
   pregnant women get the shot because a manufacturing problem at a
   British vaccine factory had cut in half the expected supply of vaccine
   for American consumers.

   To date, however, only about 34 percent of people in the high-risk
   groups have gotten vaccinated, raising concern that some vaccine may go
   unused despite the overall shortfall. That prompted the committee to
   consider revising the recommendations. Because flu vaccine has to be
   reformulated each year according to which strains of the virus become
   dominant, it cannot be saved from one year to the next.

   "On the one hand, we don't want any to go to waste. On the other hand,
   we don't want to start using it all and have the high-risk [people]
   finally show up and not be able to get vaccine," said Myron J. Levin of
   the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who chaired the panel.

   After two hours of discussion, the committee recommended that federal,
   state and local officials work between now and Jan. 3 to encourage all
   high-risk individuals to get vaccinated. A Harvard School of Public
   Health survey released this week found many had either decided to forgo
   the vaccine so there would be enough for others who need it more, or
   had tried and been unable to get the vaccine. That, coupled with the
   fact that the flu season has been mild so far, raised concern that
   there could be a rush for vaccine among high-risk people if the season
   intensifies. The flu season usually peaks in February.

   "The season has been slow to develop, and so they might not have seen a
   demand yet. We're still afraid we'll run out of vaccine," Levin said.
   "The prime emphasis is to make sure the high-risk individuals get
   vaccinated. We're going to make another push on that, and following
   that, we want to broaden it to make sure the excess vaccine that exists
   in certain areas is well-utilized."

   Vaccine availability varies around the nation, with some states
   reporting excess vaccine while others have shortages. The CDC has been
   working to direct vaccine to places with shortages and has been buying
   excess vaccine from other countries.

   Several states with excess vaccine have already relaxed their
   guidelines for who should get vaccinated. But most of the
   jurisdictions, including Virginia, Maryland and the District, have been
   waiting to see whether the CDC would change its recommendations.

   "In most communities, we're still targeting vaccine to the people in
   the highest priority groups," CDC Director Julie L. Gerberding said.

   Nurse staffing coordinator Karla Ingram stood outside San Jose Medical
   Center, taking her last cigarette break before the hospital where she's
   worked for 10 years shut its doors for good.

   "It's sad," said Ingram, who hugged a tearful co-worker on her way to
   take some final photographs of one of the units. "It's like a family
   member is dying."

   Those were common sentiments expressed by the staff of the 83-year-old
   downtown hospital, which closed at 5 p.m. Thursday. Its owner, Hospital
   Corp. of America, surprised health officials in Santa Clara County in
   September when it announced that it was closing the hospital this year,
   rather than waiting until 2007, as the company had planned.

   Reporters weren't allowed past the deserted emergency room waiting area
   Thursday, but hospital spokeswoman Leslie Kelsay said the 100 or so
   employees on duty had gathered for a morning service in the chapel and
   spent much of the day reflecting on their jobs and co-workers.

   "People are spending time taking pictures, reminiscing, doing
   last-minute exchanges of e-mail addresses," Kelsay said. "It's like the
   end of a family reunion."

   Because the 324-bed hospital has been in the process of shutting down
   for weeks, there were virtually no patients left. The last patient
   admitted was transferred to another hospital Wednesday.

   The emergency room -- one of three in the county designated as a trauma
   center -- saw just two people by midafternoon. One was a motorcyclist
   brought in by the California Highway Patrol after an accident who was
   treated and released; the other was a patient who had been seen in the
   emergency room several days ago who returned for follow-up care.

   Hospital officials have worked hard to get word out about the closure,
   sending 27,000 mailers in English, Spanish and Vietnamese to nearby
   households providing a map of remaining hospitals and advice on dealing
   with medical emergencies.

   Santa Clara County's other two designated trauma centers, the
   county-run Valley Medical Center and Stanford University Hospital, are
   making plans to take the patients who would have gone to San Jose
   Medical Center. But officials have expressed concern over their ability
   to do so smoothly.

   Hospital Corp. of America is asking the county to certify a trauma
   center at the company's Regional Medical Center across town, where the
   firm is transferring much of San Jose Medical Center's staff and
   programs.

   The fate of the 10-acre campus on the edge of downtown remains
   uncertain. Reopening as a hospital is unlikely, as it would take
   between $50 million and $100 million to bring it up to seismic safety
   standards.

   Officials have talked about everything from affordable housing and
   mixed- used development to retail shopping, Kelsay said, but no firm
   plans have emerged. The company has yet to put it on the market,
   although that is expected.

   As for Ingram, she expects to take a breather for a few weeks before
   returning to work as a contract nurse. She said she didn't expect to
   find the same level of camaraderie and sense of purpose that
   characterized the fast- paced, multicultural atmosphere at San Jose
   Medical Center.

   "Everyone just fit together so well and got along -- Vietnamese,
   Chinese, everyone," she said. "I think it's a piece of America. And we
   did some good work."

   Grey heron found H5 positive in HK [typk.jpg]
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-11 19:55:48

       HONG KONG, Dec. 11 (Xinhuanet) -- A grey heron found in Hong Kong
   earlier has been confirmed an H5 avian flu suspect, and further tests
   are underway for the nature of the virus, the Agriculture, Fisheries
   and Conservation Department said Saturday.

   A grey heron found in Hong Kong earlier has been confirmed an H5 avian
   flu suspect, and further tests are underway for the nature of the
   virus.

   The department collected the bird in Lok Ma Chau on Dec. 3. Appearing
   to be sick at the time, it was sent to the New Territories North Animal
   Management Center for isolation and observation. It died the following
   day.

       A post-mortem later at the department's Tai Lung Veterinary
   Laboratory showed the bird was an H5 suspect. Subsequent tests on the
   bird all indicated an H5 positive result.

       As a precautionary measure, Hong Kong's Center for Health
   Protection has traced all six staff who had contact with the bird, and
   found they are in good health. Their medical condition will be
   monitored over the next few days.

       As a safety measure, all poultry farms within five kilometers of
   the place where the bird was found have been inspected. There have been
   no abnormal deaths and the chickens show no symptoms of bird flu.

       Grey herons are a frequent winter visitor, but rarely visit Hong
   Kong in the summer. They are not a resident species in Hong Kong.

   Polymeal a day: the recipe for long and healthy life [typk.jpg]
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-17 14:45:41

   Daily consumption of the "Polymeal", containing fish, wine, dark
   chocolate, fruits and vegetables, garlic and almonds can dramatically
   increase life-expectancy and cut the risk of heart disease by up to 76
   percent.
   Daily consumption of the "Polymeal", containing fish, wine, dark
   chocolate, fruits and vegetables, garlic and almonds can dramatically
   increase life-expectancy and cut the risk of heart disease by up to 76
   percent.
       BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhuanet)-- A new scientific research has
   concluded that heart disease could be cut by 76% and men could expect
   to live more than six years longer if they simply ate in the right
   combination.

       Daily consumption of the "Polymeal", containing fish, wine, dark
   chocolate, fruits and vegetables, garlic and almonds can dramatically
   increase life-expectancy and cut the risk of heart disease by up to 76
   per cent, according to a research, published in the Christmas issue of
   the British Medical Journal.

       The combined effects of these different types of foods produces a
   potent mix in the body which can produce remarkable health protection
   benefits in adults.

       Men on the Polymeal would not only increase their life expectancy
   by 6.6 years but also live nine years longer without heart disease.

       In women, the polymeal increase their life expectancy by 4.8 years
   and would be free of heart disease for eight years longer, researchers
   suggested.

       The researchers, from the University Medical Centre Rotterdam in
   the Netherlands, looked at the literature about the beneficial effects
   of different food types.

       For example, daily consumption of 150ml of wine reduces heart
   disease by 32 per cent, while fish eaten four times a week cuts heart
   disease by 14 per cent. A daily intake of 100g of dark chocolate and
   400g of fruit and vegetables lower blood pressure, further cutting the
   risk of heart disease. Garlic and almonds both lower cholesterol
   levels.

       Researchers noted that fish consumed in larger amounts than
   recommended as part of the Polymeal has been related to raised blood
   mercury concentrations.

       Adverse effects reported for garlic include malodorous breath and
   body odour, so researchers do not recommend taking the Polymeal before
   a romantic rendezvous. Enditem

Blood test clue to cot death syndrome

     *
     *
     *

   23:45 Thursday 02 September 2004 00:59 Friday 03 September 2004

A BLOOD test performed on pregnant women could predict whether their baby
will be at risk of sudden infant death syndrome, according to the latest
research.

   Increased levels of a foetal protein in the mother’s blood may help
   indicate sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), says the ten-year study
   carried out by Cambridge University and Greater Glasgow Health Board’s
   Public Health Department.

   Experts looked at the records of 214,000 women who gave birth in the
   West of Scotland between 1991 and 2001. Of those babies, 114 later
   suffered cot deaths. All of the women underwent the standard tests
   during their pregnancies. These included a check of levels of alpha
   feto protein (AFP) which is found in the blood of pregnant women.

   AFP levels are already checked during the second trimester of pregnancy
   as an indicator of the risk that a baby will be born with congenital
   defects such as spina bifida or Down’s syndrome.

   Higher AFP levels, however, can also indicate placental abnormalities.

   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that
   those women who had higher AFP levels had a greater risk of having a
   baby who died from cot death.

   Women with high levels of AFP in their blood were three times more
   likely to give birth to a baby that later died from SIDS, found the
   researchers.

   The research found that there were 7.5 cot deaths per 10,000 births
   among women with the highest AFP levels, compared with 2.7 among those
   with the lowest.

   High levels of AFP in the maternal blood indicate that the placenta is
   not working properly. The baby will often be born with a low
   birth-weight, and risk of stillbirth is greater.

   "It’s been suggested that unexplained stillbirth and SIDS are related,
   and so we wanted to see if AFP levels in maternal blood was a factor in
   SIDS as well," said Gordon Smith, professor of obstetrics and
   gynaecology at the University of Cambridge, who led the study.

   "Women in the study with the highest AFP levels had a one in 1,000 risk
   of cot death, compared to the average risk of one in 2,000 - if the
   general population of pregnant women had a low level of AFP, 50 per
   cent of cot deaths wouldn’t occur," said Prof Smith.

   He said: "In at least half of cot deaths, there is a biological
   vulnerability that puts the babies at increased risk. This is probably
   an underestimate and we could say there is a biological determinant for
   the majority of SIDS deaths.

   "This study shows a clear link between the intrauterine environment and
   SIDS and that it is one of the risk factors for SIDS."

   He said it did not however allow a prediction to be made about the risk
   for an individual mother since other factors are involved.

   Dr Jill Pell, consultant in public health for NHS Greater Glasgow,
   said: "This is a significant step forward in understanding sudden
   infant death syndrome.

   "However it’s important to note that an adverse environment in the womb
   doesn’t mean that SIDS is the definite result - just that those babies
   are more susceptible to the factors that are already known to increase
   the risk of SIDS, eg passive smoking and babies sleeping on their
   fronts."

   Dr Richard Wilson, a consultant paediatrician and trustee of the
   Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, which funded the study,
   said: "This is excellent research. The Foundation for the Study of
   Infant Deaths will continue to fund research on avoidable risk factors
   for SIDS.

   "It’s crucial that all parents follow the proven advice to reduce the
   risk of cot death by sleeping babies on their backs."

   This finding could have implications for mothers who may have been
   wrongly convicted of murdering their children, as a retrospective look
   at their AFP levels could indicate a higher risk of cot death and could

   Some scientists say watching TV could lead to an increased risk for
   ADHD, while others argue that genetics and other factors play a bigger
   role in the development of the disorder.

   When most of today's parents were growing up, the common wisdom about
   television viewing was not to sit too close to the screen or you’d go
   blind. There was relatively little in the way of children’s
   programming: Sesame Street, which turned 35 this year, was in its
   infancy and there were a few cartoons, as well as Captain Kangaroo, Mr.
   Rogers and Romper Room.

   How times have changed. In the years since then, children’s programming
   has exploded. Now whole networks are devoted to young viewers.

   And, interestingly enough, something else has exploded: Attention
   Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, a behavior condition that now
   affects from 4 percent to 12 percent of U.S. children. ADHD is
   characterized by the inability to focus, listen, and complete tasks and
   schoolwork. Many children are medicated to control the condition.

   When it comes to TV, says Dr. Dimitri Christakis, a pediatric
   researcher at Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center in
   Seattle, concerns over eyesight should be the least of parents'
   concerns. Instead, he contends that ADHD and the onslaught of
   children’s programming, along with DVD players and portable TVs that
   make viewing possible anywhere anytime, may very well be linked.

   Study finds increased risk from TV
   Christakis is the lead author of a study published in the journal
   Pediatrics in April that suggests TV viewing in very young children
   contributes to attention problems later in life. “The study revealed
   that each hour of television watched per day at ages 1 through 3
   increases the risk of attention problems by almost 10 percent at age
   7,” says Christakis.

   The study attempted to control for attributes of the home environment,
   such as cognitive stimulation and emotional support, but a key factor
   was left out: the content of the programs children watched. Christakis
   says this aspect should be studied in more detail at some point, but he
   maintains that it’s not the message of the program that’s likely the
   culprit — it’s the visual tactics used.

   Christakis and others in the field, such as Jane Healy, an education
   psychologist in Vail, Colo., and author of "Your Child’s Growing Mind:
   Brain Development and Learning from Birth to Adolescence," believe
   common programming tactics designed to capture a child’s attention can
   have a deleterious affect on brain chemistry.

   Healy says overstimulation from rapid scene changes and other
   programming tactics may throw off the balance of the body's
   catecholamine system, which is responsible for carrying communications
   between nerves.

   “It has to do with neurotransmitters in the catecholamine system —
   dopamine and norepinephrine,” she adds.

   Real life becomes slow and boring
   Children’s programmers use a technique called the “orienting reflex,"
   known as OR, to capture and keep a child’s attention. OR works in this
   way: If we see or hear something the brain doesn’t recognize as the
   correct sequence or a typical life event — such as a dancing alphabet
   or quick zooms and pans, we focus on it until the brain recognizes that
   it doesn’t pose a threat. The problem with watching too many programs
   that rely on OR is that real life becomes slow and boring by
   comparison.

   “We think that with continued exposure to high intensity, unrealistic
   action, you’re conditioning the mind to expect that level of input,”
   Christakis explains. When the child doesn’t get the fast-paced input
   that television provides, he or she becomes bored and inattentive.

            Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies,
            such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50
            percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are
            puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent
            guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options,
            from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring.

   “It used to be that as educators we talked about the 'two-minute
   mind,'" says Healy. "Now it’s the 30-second mind." Of course, having an
   extremely short attention span makes listening, problem solving and
   learning to read difficult.

   Genetics may play key role
   While the implications of Christakis’s study are intriguing, not to
   mention frightening to all those decent parents who consider it a good
   day when their children sit contently watching Sesame Street and
   perhaps even a Baby Einstein chaser, they may also be a bit
   sensationalistic, says ADHD expert Dr. David Rabiner of Duke
   University.

   “At this point there’s a compelling body of evidence that suggests that
   it’s genetics that plays the biggest role in ADHD,” he says. “Not bad
   parenting.”

   While some research has been done to determine if there are links
   between ADHD and environmental factors, as well as nutrition, sleep
   disorders, exposure to toxins and certain prenatal conditions, Rabiner
   says the connections have consistently been found to be weak or
   nonexistent.

   Instead, Rabiner attributes the rise in ADHD to more awareness of the
   condition and slightly relaxed criteria for diagnosis.

   “I think it’s a gross misunderstanding of the recent study to jump to
   the conclusion that television watching leads to ADHD. The study
   doesn’t prove anything of the sort,” says Rabiner, who notes that the
   scale used in the study to determine if children who had watched TV
   later developed “attention problems” cannot be compared to the
   standards that a professional would use make a diagnosis.

   Rabiner advises parents to limit the amount of television their
   children watch for a variety of reasons, but says they should make the
   choice independent of any worries that TV causes ADHD.

   Christakis agrees — sort of. “Our study doesn’t prove a link between
   clinical ADHD and television viewing,” he says. “But I don’t even think
   that’s the most important point here. As parents, the most important
   thing is for us to do everything we can environmentally to encourage
   our children to focus as much as they are genetically endowed to.”

   What's a parent to do?
   So should parents throw the TV out the window? Healy and Christakis
   offer these more moderate suggestions:
     * Parents should keep TV viewing to a minimum, if not eliminate it,
       for a child's first two years. This is also the recommendation of
       the American Academy of Pediatrics. “There are videos that claim
       they’re good for children’s minds, but there is absolutely no
       evidence that any program is good for young children,” says
       Christakis.
     * For children older than two, limit total screen time (TV, computers
       and video games) to an hour of carefully selected programming per
       day. Slow-paced shows are preferable to fast-paced ones.
     * Reduce the background noise of TV as much as possible. Researchers
       believe background noise interferes with a child’s ability to
       concentrate on a problem and decide on a reasonable behavior or
       train of thought.
     * Encourage your children to learn through their hands and bodies.
       “It’s better to touch and smell an apple rather than watch one on
       the television or computer screen,” says Healy.
     * Talk to your child and listen instead of allowing any screen to
       talk to him or her. This communication is crucial in the
       development of language and interpersonal skills. “If you skip over
       early language or shortchange it because you’re watching television
       so much, you may never get it back,” warns Healy.

   Victoria Clayton is a freelance writer based in California and
   co-author of the forthcoming book "Fearless Pregnancy," due out in
   November from Fair Winds Press.

   HONG KONG (CNN) -- As warnings mount that a major outbreak of bird flu
   is a matter of when, not if, concerns that Hong Kong will be among the
   hardest hit areas from such a scenario are growing.

   All the great flu pandemics of the last century have originated in
   southern China, which puts Hong Kong in a very dangerous neighborhood.

   In 1997, Hong Kong was ground zero -- the first place where avian flu
   jumped the species barrier to infect, and kill, human beings.

   The outbreak saw the Hong Kong government take the unprecedented step
   of slaughtering every chicken, duck, dove and goose in the territory.

   "Hong Kong and southern China are in an area where everything comes
   together. It's like the perfect storm -- animals, the virus, population
   density," said Dr. John Nichols, a pathologist at the Hong Kong
   University.

   Nichols, who's part of a team at the cutting edge of research on avian
   flu, works at the laboratory where much of the work of identifying the
   virus was done during the 1997 outbreak.

   But as fears of a pandemic grow, scientists are expressing concern at
   how little they actually know about the disease.

   "From the science point of view, the thing I get worried about is the
   paucity of information, the fact that we are dealing with something
   that is evolving very rapidly. We may not have the time to do the
   long-standing research," Nichols said.

   Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A
   strains of the influenza virus. The disease, first identified in Italy
   more than 100 years ago, occurs worldwide.

   Infection triggers a wide spectrum of symptoms in birds, ranging from
   mild illness to a highly contagious and rapidly fatal disease resulting
   in severe epidemics.

   In severe cases, the flu is characterized by a sudden onset of severe
   illness, and rapid death, with a mortality that can approach 100
   percent.

   Hong Kong's government is taking a future outbreak very seriously,
   especially after last year's SARS epidemic, by providing more training
   for medical staff, stockpiling protective clothing, and setting up
   dedicated hospital isolation wards.

   And, with scientists like Nichols still struggling to unravel the
   secrets of the virus, Hong Kong's track record of intensive preparation
   and drastic action may be the best, if not the only, defense against
   avian flu.

   (CNN) -- This week, one issue hit home with voters and forced the
   candidates to re-think their scripts. The issue even walked off with
   the Political Play of the Week.

   They're standing in line in Florida! And Michigan! In New Jersey, the
   line goes around the block.

   Eager swing-state residents lining up to vote? Not exactly. They're
   lining up for flu shots.

   "It's incredibly serious," said Gonzalez. "We have half as much vaccine
   as we should have."

   How did that happen?

   "We relied on a company out of England to provide about half of the flu
   vaccines for the United States citizens," President Bush said during
   the October 13 debate.

   Oh oh. Sounds like ... outsourcing.

   The president had a solution.

   "We're working with Canada to hopefully ... produce a ... vaccine
   necessary," Bush said.

   But hasn't Bush expressed problems with drug import from Canada?

   "My worry is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada," Bush said
   during the October 8 debate. "It might be from the third world. We've
   just got to make sure before somebody thinks they're buying a product
   that works."

   Bush made a plea to the public during the October 13 debate, saying,
   "If you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year."

   Sounds like rationing. Something the president says would result from
   Kerry's health care plan.

   "Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing," Bush said
   during the October 8 debate.

   The government has the situation under control, the president said.
   "The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those
   priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly."

   Isn't that government control?

   At a rally in New Hampshire on October 1, the president said, "My
   opponent wants the government to run health care ...." The audience
   replied with boos.

   Maybe the answer is legal reform.

   "Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore
   they have backed from providing this kind of vaccine," Bush said.

   Kerry said the issue is the whole health care system.

   "And if there aren't enough flu vaccinations, what's the president's
   solution? He says, 'Don't get one if you're healthy.' Sounds just like
   his health care plan -- hope you don't get sick," Kerry said Thursday.

   The flu bug has infected the campaign. And the side effect was the
   political Play of the Week.

   What President Bush warns could happen under the Kerry health care plan
   -- shortages, rationing -- is exactly what's happening now.

   The issue is whether the Kerry health care plan would solve the
   problem. Or make it worse.

Fatty Fish And Alzheimer's

   New evidence may further explain why people who regularly eat
   heart-healthy fish seem to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's
   disease.
   A new study indicates that high amounts of one of the omega-3 fatty
   acids found in salmon, mackerel, and herring -- docosahexaenoic acid,
   or DHA -- may protect against the memory loss caused by Alzheimer's,
   even when there are already brain lesions indicating advanced disease.
   The study also indicates that DHA may protect against brain cell
   damage, similar to that seen in Alzheimer's.
   This discovery comes after a team of American and French researchers
   infused mice with a human Alzheimer's-causing gene so they would
   develop brain lesions like that seen in advanced Alzheimer's. The point
   was to monitor the rodents' disease progression and better determine
   how various environmental factors might influence Alzheimer's
   progression.
   What they found was that even though the mice developed brain lesions
   like that found in advanced Alzheimer's, they still showed little
   evidence of memory loss or other disease symptoms.
   Secret in Mouse Chow -- and Fish
   "We looked and looked at what could be providing this protection
   against the cognitive deficits we usually see in Alzheimer's patients
   with these brain lesions," says researcher Greg Cole, PhD, professor of
   neurology at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine. "And when we
   looked at their diet, we were surprised to learn why."
   Their commercial feed was abundant in these omega-3 fatty acids, and
   specifically DHA. "It was so rich in DHA that it closely resembled the
   Japanese diet," he tells WebMD.
   That fish- and seaweed-rich diet, already known to be heart-healthy,
   has long been suspected of playing some role in the prevention of
   Alzheimer's. Several studies in recent years show that people who
   regularly eat diets high in DHA have a lower risk of developing
   Alzheimer's disease.
   While the abundance of healthy polyunsaturated fats like DHA in certain
   fish has been considered a protection against Alzheimer's, one popular
   theory is that these heart-healthy fish might improve impeded blood
   flow to the brain. Other research shows that cholesterol-lowering
   statins and "blood-thinning" aspirin and other nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) pain relievers may also lower risk of
   Alzheimer's by reducing inflammation or increasing blood flow.
   "But our study suggests there's a causal relationship that's
   independent of vascular dementia or atherosclerosis," Cole tells WebMD.
   That's because his test mice carried the Alzheimer's gene, but did not
   have any indications of cardiovascular disease and blood flow
   abnormalities.
   Specifically, his team reports in the latest issue of Neuron that DHA
   may prevent or slow Alzheimer's progression by protecting against
   damage to the area where brain cells communicate. Damage to these
   "synaptic" areas is known to impair memory and learning ability and
   typically occurs in Alzheimer's patients.
   Eat Fish at Least Once a Week
   After noting the mice chow was high in DHA, Cole's team switched the
   rodents to a diet rich in safflower oil, known to deplete the body's
   DHA stores, he says. One group, already with advanced brain lesions,
   got no additional DHA supplementation while the other, also with
   advanced lesions, was fed DHA-rich algae to regain beneficial levels.
   After five months, the mice whose new diet was depleted of DHA showed
   high levels of synaptic damage that's consistent with advanced
   Alzheimer's deterioration. But the group getting high levels of DHA
   continued to perform well in memory tests, even though they carried the
   Alzheimer's gene. The conclusion: "The DHA-enriched diet was holding
   their genetic disease at bay," says Cole.
   Martha Clare Morris, ScD, of the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in
   Chicago, says these findings don't surprise her. She was not involved
   in Cole's research but last summer, she published a study in Archives
   of Neurology showing that people older than age 65 who ate omega-3-rich
   fish at least once a week were 60% less likely to develop Alzheimer's
   compared with those who rarely ate these fish.
   "We looked at the different types of omega-3 fatty acids in relation to
   the risk of developing Alzheimer's, and of these acids, it was DHA that
   seemed to have a very strong protective association," she tells WebMD.
   "Still, it's a very interesting study."
   Although DHA is also found in fish oil supplements, how these
   over-the-counter pills specifically impact the development or
   progression of Alzheimer's has not been carefully studied, she adds.
   Eggs laid by chickens fed a DHA-supplemented diet contain some DHA, as
   do almonds and walnuts, but the highest amounts come from cold-water
   fish.
   "The few studies that show a benefit find that just one or two fish

   Schools, food makers, government agencies and families themselves must
   work together to reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity, a panel of
   scientists said Thursday.
   The prestigious Institute of Medicine called Thursday for the
   wide-ranging effort that includes less time in front of television and
   computer screens, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school
   and community physical education programs and education to help
   children make better choices.
   "We must act now and we must do this as a nation," said Dr. Jeffrey
   Koplan of Emory University in Atlanta, chairman of the committee that
   prepared the recommendations.
   The report from the IOM, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, is
   the latest to focus on the sharp increase in childhood obesity. Over
   the last 30 years the rate of childhood obesity has tripled among
   youngsters aged 6 to 11 and has doubled for those aged 2 to 5 and 12 to
   19, the institute reported.
   "Obesity may be a personal issue, but at the same time, families,
   communities and corporations all are adversely affected by obesity and
   all bear responsibility for changing social norms to better promote
   healthier lifestyles," added Koplan, former director of the federal
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Obesity can lead to increased likelihood of developing diabetes, high
   blood pressure, sleep problems, high cholesterol, gallstones and other
   problems.
   "Things have changed ... pushing kids to eat more and be less active,"
   observed Dr. Stephen R. Daniels of Cincinnati Children's Hospital
   Medical Center.
   "It's very clear that the solution is not in any one place," said
   Daniels, of the hospital's comprehensive weight management center.
   "Ultimately the major approach to this is prevention ... we have to
   start early," he said, urging cooperation of family, community, schools
   and industry.
   Specifically, the panel suggested that parents to limit kids' TV hours,
   that schools provide healthier food, that restaurants offer nutrition
   information and that communities provide more recreation opportunities.
   On Tuesday, three U.S. Cabinet secretaries fanned out across the
   country to promote healthier lifestyles, especially among young people.
   "The cities have got to set aside (safe) places for kids to get outside
   and walk or even ride their bicycles," said Health and Human Services
   Secretary Tommy Thompson. Also on the road promoting healthier
   lifestyles were Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Surgeon General
   Richard Carmona and Education Secretary Rod Paige.
   The IOM report calls for increased federal involvement, including
   creation of an interdepartmental task force to coordinate activities,
   developing nutrition standards for school food, setting guidelines for
   advertising and marketing to children and increases in research
   funding.
   And it seconds Thompson's call for increased recreational facilities,
   urging state and local governments and schools to expand opportunities
   for physical activity, including providing more facilities and more
   frequent and intense after-school programs.
   Urban and suburban community designs that discourage walking and other
   physical activities, such as communities without sidewalks, are among
   the causes of the increase in youth obesity, the report said.
   Other causes cited included increased use of convenience foods that are
   high in fat and calories, less physical activity in school and more
   leisure time spent in front of televisions and computer screens instead
   of playing outdoors.

Laptops A Male Fertility Risk?

   Health Generic- Male fertility may be affected by perching laptop
   computers on the lap. Laptop with Human sperm under microscope on

   Male fertility may be affected by perching laptop computers on the lap,
   according to a new study.
   Balancing laptop computers on the lap raises the scrotum's temperature,
   say researchers including Yefim Sheynkin, MD, FACS, of the urology
   department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   About 15-20 percent of couples that want to get pregnant aren't able to
   conceive. Many of those cases trace back to issues relating to the
   male. Gradually declining sperm production has been noted in recent
   decades, say the researchers.
   Elevated scrotal temperatures have been linked to male infertility.
   Many factors can raise scrotal temperature, including hot baths,
   saunas, and tight jockey shorts.
   Laptop computers may also belong on that list, say Sheynkin's team.
   They studied 29 healthy young men ages 21 to 35 for two one-hour
   sessions in a climate-controlled room.
   Participants were all similarly dressed in casual clothes. After having
   their body temperature taken and standing in the room for 15 minutes to
   adjust to the room's temperature, they sat down and were given working
   or nonworking laptop computers.
   The researchers used two brands of Pentium 4 laptop computers. The
   brands weren't identified in the study, which appears in the European
   journal Human Reproduction.
   The men balanced the computers on their laps. The researchers then
   removed the nonworking computers, instructing the men to hold the
   position for the rest of the session. Participants with working laptop
   computers kept the computers in place throughout the session.
   The men's scrotal temperature was recorded every three minutes. The
   temperature on the bottom of the working computers was also monitored.
   Scrotal temperature rose with the working and nonworking computers.
   However, the working laptops prompted a greater increase in scrotal
   temperature — around 37 degrees Fahrenheit on both sides of the scrotum
   (2.8 degrees Celsius on the right and 2.6 degrees Celsius on the left).
   Participants without working laptops had a scrotal temperature increase
   of just under 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2.1 degrees Celsius).
   Technology doesn't deserve all the blame. The position required to
   balance a laptop computer in the lap — with thighs close together to
   balance the computers — also increases scrotal temperature. Still, the
   heat generated by the laptops adds to the problem.
   In the study, the bottom of the laptop computers rose from about 88
   degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) to almost 104 degrees
   Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) after an hour. Both brands had similar
   temperature increases.
   "Working on laptop computers in a laptop position causes significant
   scrotal temperature elevation as a result of heat exposure and
   posture-related effects," say the researchers.
   Is the increase enough to impair male fertility? The researchers can't
   say for sure. However, they note that another study showed that sperm
   concentration dropped by 40 percent when median daytime scrotal
   temperature rose to about 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius).
   More than 60 million laptop computers are expected to be in use by
   2005, with another 90 million worldwide, the researchers say. Calling
   for more studies, they suggest that teenage boys and young men may want
   to limit their use of laptop computers on their laps.

High folate intake equals lower risk of high blood pressure for women

   If you are a woman and consume 800 micrograms or more of folate per day
   you are much less likely to be at risk of having high blood pressure,
   says a new study.
   Having a high folate intake already benefits women when they want to
   have a baby as it reduces the chances of the baby being born with spina
   bifida.
   The benefits for blood pressure were presented at the American Heart
   Association's annual conference, Chicago, USA.
   Researchers examined data from the Nurses' Health Study 1 (62,260 women
   aged 43-70) and Nurses' Health Study 2 (93,043 women aged 26-46). The
   study was led by Dr. J Forman, Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital,
   USA.
   At the beginning of the study none of the women had hypertension (high
   blood pressure). The women had to complete a questionnaire at the
   beginning of the study which asked them about their eating habits,
   health habits, folate intake, and other factors. The women were
   followed up every two years - the whole study lasted 8 years. During
   this time the women took their own blood pressure and informed the
   researchers.
   The average folate consumption was 250 micrograms per day.
   The findings were as follows:
   -- Younger women
   Intake 800 micrograms per day (or more)
   29% lower risk of high blood pressure (than those with a lower than 200
   micrograms per day)
   -- Older Women
   800 micrograms of folate per day (or more)
   13% lower risk of high blood pressure (than those with a lower than 200
   micrograms per day)
   Forman added that in order to consume 800 micrograms or more per day
   one has to take a supplement.

New Zealand Medical Association welcomes condom campaign

   MNT Knowledge Center
   The New Zealand Medical Association has welcomed a new sexual health
   campaign which aims to reduce the rates of sexually transmitted
   infections among New Zealand teenagers.
   The Ministry of Health campaign - No Rubba, no Hubba Hubba - was
   launched today (Monday 22 November).
   ?Rates of chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections have been
   rising among New Zealand teens,? said NZMA Chairman Dr Tricia Briscoe.
   ?This campaign has a strong direct message to teens -- if they are
   sexually active they should use condoms. It's a simple message, but
   highly effective.
   ?We applaud the use of language and the approach taken in the campaign.
   While some older people may not like it, it's important that it appeals
   to young people so the message gets taken on board.?
   Dr Briscoe said while many sexually transmitted infections are
   relatively easy to diagnose and treat, there can be harmful long-term
   consequences, such as infertility, if they are not treated. Aids is
   also a concern and it would be particularly devastating if it became
   widespread in the teenage community.
   The NZMA is also pleased to note that a booklet written for young
   people, as part of the campaign, includes tips about how they can wait
   until they are ready for sex, and how to avoid being pressured into
   sex.
   ?At the end of the day, many young people are having sex whether their
   parents know or not, or want them to or not, and we have to be
   realistic about this. It is so important that our teens have knowledge
   and practical advice about keeping themselves safe and free from
   infection.?

Some herbal medicines contain potentially toxic amounts of heavy metals

   An analysis of a sample of Ayurvedic herbal medicine products found
   that 20 percent contained metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic at
   levels that could be toxic if taken as directed, according to a study
   in the December 15 issue of JAMA.
   According to background information in the article, approximately 80
   percent of India's one billion population uses Ayurveda, a medical
   system that originated in India more than 2000 years ago and greatly
   relies on herbal medicine products (HMPs). Ayurveda's popularity in
   Western countries has increased. Because Ayurvedic HMPs are marketed as
   dietary supplements, they are regulated under the Dietary Supplement
   Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which does not require proof of
   safety or efficacy prior to marketing. Herbs, minerals and metals are
   used in Ayurvedic HMPs. Recent reports of serious lead poisoning
   associated with taking Ayurvedic HMPs were the impetus for the current
   study.
   Robert B. Saper, M.D., M.P.H., formerly of Harvard Medical School,
   Boston, (currently with the Boston University School of Medicine) and
   colleagues examined Ayurvedic HMPs manufactured in South Asia and sold
   in Boston-area stores in order to examine their heavy metal content.
   From April to October 2003, the researchers purchased 70 different
   Ayurvedic HMPs at stores within 20 miles of Boston City Hall.
   Concentrations of lead, mercury and arsenic were measured in the
   samples. The potential amount of daily metal ingestion, estimated by
   using manufacturers' dosage recommendations, was compared to U.S.
   Pharmacopeia and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory
   standards.
   The researchers found that 14 (20 percent) of the 70 HMPs contained
   lead, mercury and/or arsenic, and that if taken as recommended by the
   manufacturer, each of these could result in heavy metal intake above
   the published regulatory standards. Lead was found in 13 HMPs; mercury
   in six HMPs; and arsenic in six HMPs. Half of the HMPs containing
   potentially toxic heavy metals were recommended for children. The 14
   HMPs containing heavy metals were manufactured by 11 different
   companies. Of the 30 stores visited, 24 sold at least one heavy
   metal-containing HMP.
   "? the presence of heavy metals in Ayurvedic HMPs and the numerous
   reports of associated toxicity may have important public health,
   clinical, and policy implications in the United States and abroad.
   Although the prevalence of heavy metal-containing Ayurvedic HMP use is
   unknown, the number of individuals at potential risk is substantial,"
   the authors write. "Public health and community organizations should
   consider issuing advisories to current or previous Ayurvedic HMP users,
   encouraging them to consult their physicians about heavy metal
   screening."
   "Our findings support calls for reform of DSHEA that would require
   mandatory testing of all imported dietary supplements for toxic heavy
   metals," they conclude.

   Domestic violence is a significant and preventable cause of injury to
   women. The majority of cases involve violence perpetrated by a male
   partner, and heavy drinking has also been implicated as a risk factor.
   A study in the December issue of Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental
   Research looks at alcohol consumption and perpetration of spousal abuse
   by male U.S. Army soldiers. Findings indicate that soldiers who drink
   heavily are more likely to abuse their spouses both when they are and
   when they are not drinking alcohol; heavy drinking is also associated
   with subsequent episodes of spouse abuse even when drinking habits are
   measured years prior to the event.
   -- Domestic violence is a significant and preventable cause of injury
   to women.
   -- Soldiers who drink heavily are more likely to abuse their spouses
   both when they are, and when they are not, drinking alcohol.
   -- Heavy drinking is also associated with subsequent episodes of spouse
   abuse even when drinking habits are measured years prior to the event.
   "Women are not only more likely than men to be victims of abuse at some
   point in their lifetime, but women are also more likely to sustain
   serious injury than are male victims of abuse," said Nicole S. Bell,
   first author of the study and a vice-president at Social Sectors
   Development Strategies, Incorporated. "However, it is important to note
   that married men and women are about equally likely to initiate
   physical abuse against each other. In fact, male victims of abuse may
   find it more difficult than female victims to come forward to report
   their experience due to social stigmatization or shame."
   Bell added that heavy drinking is clearly a risk factor for intimate
   partner violence (IPV). "Men who drink heavily are more likely to abuse
   their partners both when they are drinking and when they are not
   drinking than men who are light drinkers. Put another way, women who
   live with heavy drinkers are more likely to be victims of IPV.
   Furthermore, women who are themselves heavy drinkers are also more
   likely to be victims of IPV, though it is not always clear whether
   their heavy drinking preceded the abuse event or is adopted as a way to
   cope with an unpleasant home life."
   "One of the unique things about this study is that it's able to link
   data from difference sources," added Gordon Smith, an associate public
   health professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
   "This study was able to measure baseline alcohol consumption of a group
   of soldiers, and then follow them over time to see if there's an
   increased risk of them being a perpetrator of spousal abuse. Most
   studies take more of a cross sectional approach, interviewing people
   who have already been accused of spousal abuse, and then looking at
   their drinking. Self reports of alcohol consumption at the time of the
   abuse event are likely unreliable; it's an emotional time, and some
   people may over or under report their alcohol
   consumption ? we really don't know."
   For this study, participants comprised all active-duty, male, enlisted
   Army spousal abusers identified in the Army's Central Registry (ACR)
   who had also completed an Army Health Risk Appraisal Survey (HRA)
   between the years of 1991 and 1998 (n=9,534). Their data were compared
   with that of 21,786 "controls" who were matched on gender, rank,
   marital status and had also completed an HRA.
   "We chose to focus on Army soldiers primarily because we have extensive
   data available to study them both before and after the abuse event,"
   said Bell. "We were able to examine the stability of the relationship
   between drinking and perpetration of spousal abuse over a relatively
   long follow-up time. Furthermore, unlike some other studies of
   perpetrators that have examined populations with criminal backgrounds
   or those in treatment programs, this study population is relatively
   high functioning in that they're fully employed, have full access to
   healthcare, and hold a wide range of different occupations within the
   Army such as truck drivers, cooks, infantry soldiers, flight crew, and
   mechanics. Finally, the sheer size of this study population allowed us
   to explore variations in risk for abuse in different race and age
   subgroups."
   The results showed that those classified as the heaviest drinkers (22
   or more drinks per week) were 66 percent more likely to abuse their
   spouses than those classified as abstainers. In addition, self-reported
   moderate (8 to 14 drinks per week) and heavy drinkers (15 to 21 drinks
   per week) were three times as likely, and light drinkers (1 to 7 drinks
   per week) were twice as likely, as soldiers who report they typically
   consume less than one drink per week, to be drinking during the time of
   the abuse event.
   "In short, we found that the enlisted, married, male Army soldiers who
   drink heavily are more likely to abuse their spouses both when they are
   and when they are not drinking alcohol," said Bell.
   Researchers also found that heavy drinking is associated with
   subsequent episodes of spousal abuse even when drinking habits are
   measured years prior to the event. "The link between self-reported
   typical drinking habits and increased risk for spousal abuse appears to
   be stable even over long periods of time," said Bell. "That is,
   soldiers who report drinking heavily who are then followed for several
   years are still, years later, at greater risk for spousal-abuse events,
   particularly those involving alcohol during the event, but also those
   not involving alcohol."
   Bell added that the study's findings have several implications. "First,
   it might be wise to evaluate soldiers identified as heavy drinkers
   during routine health screening tests for interpersonal violence," she
   said. "Likewise, soldiers identified as spouse-abuse perpetrators or
   victims should be carefully screened for alcohol abuse. Second, alcohol
   use is related to increased risk for spousal abuse when neither the
   perpetrator nor the victim has been drinking, and this is true even
   when alcohol-use habits are measured years before the event. Thus,
   there may be some behavioral or social factors that are associated with
   both drinking and the propensity to abuse a spouse - such as
   impulsivity or aggression - and these factors may not dissipate over
   time. Young men who are heavy drinkers may 'age out' of these drinking
   behaviors or at least moderate their drinking as they get older, but it
   is not clear if they will also 'age out' of other factors that may go
   along with heavy drinking behaviors, such as impulsivity or
   aggression."
   "Many people assume you can't do anything about heavy drinking, but
   there are clearly studies that show if you can screen and identify
   people with problem drinking and get them into early treatment then you
   can significantly reduce the consequences of the drinking, including
   spousal abuse," added Smith. "Treatment for alcoholism or problem
   drinking has similar effectiveness
   to that for other chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes. If people
   have asthma, they will keep having recurring attacks of asthma no
   matter how good the treatment is, but treatment reduces the frequency
   and severity of the attacks. It's the same with people who have
   diabetes. Treatment for alcoholism does work, and can prevent or reduce
   the frequency of relapses in many people. However, like most
   chronic-disease therapies, treatment does not always work 100 percent
   of the time."
   Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research (ACER) is the official
   journal of the Research Society on Alcoholism and the International
   Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. Co-authors of the ACER
   paper, "Drinking and spouse abuse among U.S. Army soldiers," were
   Thomas C. Harford of the Boston University School of Public Health;
   James E. McCarroll of the Department of Psychiatry at Uniformed
   Services University of the Health Sciences; and Laura Senier of Social
   Sectors Development Strategies, Inc. The study was funded by the
   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

                                Election 2004

                     Medical votes no solution to fight

Three amendments on malpractice suits and patient safety passed, but doctors
                         and lawyers remain at odds.

                               By LISA GREENE
                         Published November 4, 2004
     __________________________________________________________________

      Three constitutional amendments and $27-million later, the fight
              between Florida's doctors and lawyers isn't over.

   Now that all three amendments related to malpractice suits and patient
    safety passed, both sides are looking to challenge the measures. Two
       lawsuits were filed Wednesday. Two of the amendments have to be
   implemented by the Legislature, virtually guaranteeing another round of
            lobbying, jockeying and hostility between the sides.

     Even some of the chief players say they are losing their taste for
                                   battle.

     "This incessant doctor vs. lawyer fight - at some point it needs to
      come to an end," said Alexander Clem, president of the Academy of
        Florida Trial Lawyers. "At some point it becomes professional
                                 genocide."

   One of the three measures, backed by state doctors, limits the share of
   money that patients' lawyers can receive in medical malpractice cases.
      Amendment 3 garnered the most attention and the most cash, with a
   lawyer-backed group spending most of its $20-million in a bid to defeat
                      it. It takes effect immediately.

   But the other two amendments were backed by the trial lawyers, and they
   passed as well. If, as lawyers say, Amendment 3 will make it harder for
      them to bring malpractice cases, Amendments 7 and 8 will make it
                                   easier.

    One gives patients broader access to records about medical mistakes,
     while the other is a "three strikes" measure that would revoke the
      licenses of doctors with repeated legal judgments or disciplinary
                            actions against them.

    Despite the huge amount of money spent on Amendment 3, some observers
                       say the lawyers came out ahead.

   "Doctors come out with the short stick, and patients come out with the
     short stick," said Jay Wolfson, director of the University of South
           Florida's Suncoast Center for Patient Safety Research.

   Wolfson, who opposed all three amendments, said lawyers may take fewer
     cases because of 3, but because of three strikes, doctors will face
      considerable pressure to settle legal cases - especially if they
   already have a judgment against them. He said patients lose because, in
             his view, the amendments don't help patient safety.

   Lawyers already are looking at how to challenge Amendment 3. Clem said
    Wednesday the amendment infringes on the rights of private citizens.
       "If an individual agrees to enter into a contract to come on my
     property and cut down a tree ... that's in my right to contract for
     that," he said. "Where do we go next? Cap the amount that Shaquille
                              O'Neal can earn?"

    But the state Supreme Court reviewed Amendment 3 and agreed to put it
    on the ballot, said Elizabeth Hirst of Citizens for a Fair Share, the
                     amendment's doctor-backed sponsor.

   "We feel very, very confident that Amendment 3 can and will stand up to
   any potential legal challenge," she said. "The voters have spoken, the
   court has already spoken, and we are ready to move forward with getting
                  patients more of the money they deserve."

      Meanwhile, on Wednesday the Florida Hospital Association, Shands
   Hospital, a teaching hospital in Gainesville and Adventist Health Care
    System/Sunbelt Inc. filed suit against the Florida Agency for Health
   Care Administration and the Department of Health in Alachua County over
            Amendment 7. A similar suit was filed in Leon County.

        The lawsuit asks the courts to let the Legislature, which has
     consistently voted to restrict access to medical records, make the
      rules that will determine who gets access to such records. In the
    alternative, the suits ask the courts to set rules for the release of
                                  records.

   "The amendments are so broad and so vague and so confusing that no one
     has any idea what they mean," said Bill Bell, the Florida Hospital
      Association's general counsel. "We have to have guidance from the
                 courts on how they are to be implemented."

       The groups also will lobby legislators on how the two should be
   structured. It's likely, for example, that doctors will argue Amendment
   7 should apply narrowly, only to documents that hospitals are required
      to file when unexpected deaths and injuries occur. Hirst wouldn't
       discuss those specifics. "Most immediately, we are enjoying the
    victory," she said. "It was a tough battle, but the medical community
           was able to get the facts out to patients and voters."
