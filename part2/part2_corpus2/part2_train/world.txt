   As lightning flashes intermittently in an otherwise clear sky, a group
   of more than 200 Marines begins to gear up on a dusty plain outside the
   Iraqi city of Fallujah. Officers bark orders, directing grunts into
   their vehicles. Tank drivers climb into turrets and crank up
   heavy-metal tunes. Infantrymen who moments earlier had been asking
   about baseball scores exhort one another to move forward. "This is what
   you trained for, Marine!" "You're the hunter! You're the predator!"

   As the group prepared to move last Thursday on the city that has most
   bedeviled the U.S. occupation, the hyperbole seemed appropriate.
   Fallujah is the presumed base of Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi, the most potent
   terrorist in Iraq. And more than 100 suspected insurgents have been
   arrested in recent weeks in nearby villages. Now the 3rd Battalion, 5th
   Marines along with the Army's Brigade Combat Team 2 and a company from
   the 2nd Tank Battalion — a combined force exceeding 1,000 troops — were
   about to launch the biggest move on Fallujah in months. The 3/5 would
   not enter the city but intended to go right up to the southeastern
   outskirts. The Army would move to the southwestern edge and the tankers
   to the northern limits, while F/A-18s continued to pound suspected
   insurgent hideouts. Yet this was not the big showdown everyone had
   expected but rather an attempt to see how the insurgents inside the
   city would respond. A Marine battle-operations officer called it "a
   dress rehearsal" for the ultimate combat. This was a scouting mission,
   a risk-filled feint supported by air power, an attempt to get an edge
   for the eventual showdown.

   The latest counterinsurgency effort began in a week that included the
   start of Ramadan and saw the U.S. military — primarily the 1st Marine
   Expeditionary Force — move boldly to try to subdue the rebellion raging
   in Fallujah and Ramadi, the two most restive towns in Anbar, Iraq's
   most restive province. New forces were brought in, new strategies
   employed. But despite clear successes, the week's record of strikes and
   counterstrikes suggests that if, as the young Marine said, the
   Americans are predators, the prey is dictating the nature of the hunt.

   The assault had begun in Ramadi two days earlier, when much of the 2nd
   Battalion, 5th Marines joined the elite 36th Battalion of the Iraqi
   National Guard and their U.S. special- forces advisers to raid seven
   mosques in the city. As in Fallujah, attempts to prop up a local
   government in Ramadi have faltered amid violence, kidnappings and
   assassinations. Military bases in both places are frequently mortared.
   Unlike in Fallujah, though, in Ramadi the Marines are a regular
   presence in the streets. And they are hit daily by a mostly invisible
   enemy, bountifully armed with improvised explosive devices (IEDS),
   rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and automatic weapons. Most attacks
   occur on Ramadi's main road, dubbed Route Michigan. (When asked if
   they're in control of the city, a roomful of grunts responds with
   phrases like "Oh, f___ no!") The mosques offer support and sanctuary to
   fighters, the Marines say. Calls to attack Americans and the Iraqis
   working with them go out over the mosques' loudspeakers.

   Iraq's 36th Battalion was called in because American troops are
   forbidden to enter mosques and because the 36th is battle tested,
   having taken part in earlier sieges in Najaf and Samarra. "God willing,
   we will go anywhere in Iraq and kill the terrorists," says battalion
   commander Fadil Jamel. With the 36th out front, the Marines play a
   supporting role.

Militants claim Jakarta bombing

   Militants say the embassy strike calls Australia to account

   Summary

   Muslim Jemaah Islamiyah militants are suspected of detonating the car
   bomb that exploded Thursday outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta,
   killing nine people and wounding 173 in a bloody strike at a key U.S.
   ally in the war in Iraq.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia — Muslim Jemaah Islamiyah militants are suspected of
   detonating the car bomb that exploded Thursday outside the Australian
   Embassy in Jakarta, killing nine people and wounding 173 in a bloody
   strike at a key U.S. ally in the war in Iraq.

   The blast — the first major attack attributed to Jemaah Islamiyah in
   more than a year — could influence elections in Australia, where the
   prime minister is running on a pro-American, anti-terror platform.

   The bombing also comes just ahead of Indonesia's presidential elections
   and two days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the
   United States. The explosion left body parts and bloody corpses strewn
   across the busy thoroughfare and shattered windows in buildings 500
   yards away. It gutted the Greek Embassy on the 12th floor of an
   adjacent building, slightly wounding three diplomats.

   Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian terror group linked to al-Qaida,
   purportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was
   punishing Australia for supporting the war in Iraq. The statement was
   posted on an Internet site known for carrying extremist Islamic
   content, and its authenticity could not immediately be verified.

   "We decided to call Australia to account, which we consider one of the
   worst enemies of God, and God's religion of Islam," the statement said.
   "Here we were able to call it to account today in Jakarta, where one of
   the mujahedeen (holy warriors) was able to execute a martyrdom
   operation with a car bomb in front of the embassy."

   The Internet statement also called on the Australian government to
   withdraw from Iraq and advised all Australians to leave Indonesia or
   face more violence.

   Police said the bomb was likely the work of Azahari Husin, a reputed
   Jemaah Islamiyah member who has been on the run for three years.

   No one in the heavily fortified Australian Embassy was killed, although
   several Australians and Chinese were wounded.

   The bombing came less than a week after the United States and Australia
   upgraded long-standing travel warnings to their citizens in Indonesia,
   citing an increased risk of terror attacks on Western targets.

   Jemaah Islamiyah has been blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings that killed
   202 people, including 88 Australians, and the Aug. 5, 2003, suicide
   bombing at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people.

   Australia, a key supporter of the U.S. war on terrorism, sent 2,000
   troops for last year's invasion of Iraq and still has more than 850
   military personnel in the country. The Iraq war is deeply unpopular in
   Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation.

   White House press secretary Scott McClellan condemned the bombing in a
   statement issued in Pennsylvania, where President Bush was campaigning.

   "This is yet another attack against civilized people everywhere," the
   statement said. "We condemn this outrageous act. The president
   reaffirms our solidarity with the governments of Indonesia and
   Australia in fighting the global war against terrorism."

   Islamic extremists are believed to have tried to influence the outcome
   of elections elsewhere. They blew up commuter trains in Spain just
   before elections in March, killing 191 people. Days later, voters
   elected a Socialist administration that made good on its campaign
   pledge to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq.

   Australian Prime Minister John Howard has faced criticism over sending
   troops to Iraq — a decision his opponents say has made Australia more
   vulnerable to terror attacks.

   "This is not a nation that is going to be intimidated by acts of
   terrorism," Howard said after Thursday's bombing.

French PM calls crisis meeting over hostages

   French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin today called a crisis
   meeting to discuss the fate of the two French journalists still held
   hostage in Iraq, as efforts to secure their release threatened to
   descend into farce.

   Mr Raffarin summoned top ministers to meet after a row between the
   government and two self-appointed mediators whose parallel mediation on
   behalf of Charles Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot collapsed at the
   weekend.

   Didier Julia, a 70-year-old member of Jacques Chirac's UMP party and
   businessman Philippe Brett were accused of endangering the lives of the
   two French reporters who have been missing for six weeks.

   After leaving the Syrian capital of Damascus at the weekend Mr Julia
   admitted he had lost contact with the group holding the hostages and
   was worried about their fate. However, he denied doing anything to
   threaten their future.

   "I have done absolutely nothing wrong, nothing obstructive nor
   dangerous," he told a French radio station.

   "At no moment could it be thought that because of me the life of the
   hostages would have been put in danger," he said, adding that his
   efforts had not run up against any rival operation by the French
   government.

   Julia earned the reprobation of France last Friday, when he declared
   there was a convoy carrying the journalists out of Iraq - along with
   his associate, a former French navy commando named Philippe Brett, who
   he said had arranged their release - but it failed to materialise.

   The row has shattered an unspoken agreement under which the opposition
   refrained for more than five weeks from criticising the government over
   the hostage drama.

   It has also undermined confidence in the government's policy of quiet
   diplomacy and raised questions about how President Chirac could allow a
   member of his own political party to embark on a mission that might
   endanger the hostages.

   "It's bordering on the ridiculous. French diplomacy has been
   humiliated," Ségolène Royal, a leading Socialist regional leader, told
   Reuters. She demanded an explanation from Mr Raffarin when he briefs
   parliamentarians on the crisis tomorrow.

   Some members of parliament are asking whether Chirac really knew more
   about the rescue mission than he is letting on. The government and
   presidency distanced itself from the mission as soon as it started, but
   Le Monde newspaper said on Monday that Mr Chirac's office was kept
   informed by Julia all along.

   France was shocked when the two journalists were seized by a group
   calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq. The kidnapping undermined the
   belief that France's opposition to the US invasion last year gave its
   citizens some security.

   The French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, went to the region and
   mobilised a wide front of Arab leaders and Muslim figures to call for
   their release but this did not bring them freedom.

   Mr Barnier criticised Mr Julia and Mr Brett on Saturday, saying their
   mission torpedoed indirect contacts which French officials had quietly
   established with the kidnappers.

   Last week, Mr Brett told a French radio station that he was with the
   journalists and that they could be free "within hours".

   In a telephone interview broadcast live on Europe 1, Mr Brett said he
   was "finalising" a deal for the release of Christian Chesnot and
   Georges Malbrunot, Le Figaro's Iraq correspondent, who were seized on
   August 20. But he declined to reveal where the hostages were being
   held.

   "I cannot tell you any more. We are finalising at the moment. I don't
   want to compromise the situation, which is already complicated enough."

   Mr Malbrunot and Mr Chesnot disappeared on August 20 along with their
   Syrian driver. A group called the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed
   responsibility for their capture and demanded France revoke a ban on
   the wearing of Islamic headscarves in state schools.

   The Iraqi capital continued to be rocked by violence as insurgents
   killed three policemen and injured another during an attack on a police
   station. In another incident, a senior Public Works Ministry official
   and four aides were gunned down while driving to work.

   In central Baghdad, a US soldier was also killed and nine others
   wounded when their unit came under attack.

   The attacks came as the Iraqi Electoral Commission announced January 30
   next year as the date for elections to choose a transitional
   parliament.

   Seven people were killed on Saturday when the bus they were travelling
   in through Ramadi, west of Baghdad, came under fire. Ramadi police
   chief Brigadier Jasim al-Dulaimi said US troops opened fire on the bus,
   which was riddled with bullets.

   In the northern city of Mosul, the bodies of nine Iraqi soldiers were
   found by US troops on Sunday. Each had been shot in the back of the
   head.

   Meanwhile, a Polish woman, kidnapped more than three weeks ago and
   feared killed, was back in Warsaw yesterday after being released by her
   captors. Teresa Borcz-Khalifa, 54, who lived in Iraq for 30 years and
   was married to an Iraqi, was kidnapped from her home on October 28.

Quiet before storm for ASEAN's poorest

   By Connie Levett
   South East Asia Correspondent

   Officials order a search of a rural taxi outside Vientiane as part of

   The ASEAN summit, the biggest event Laos has ever staged, rolls into
   Vientiane with the cool season.

   The That Luang (full moon) festival is on and the food stalls on the
   banks of the Mekong should be jostling with people.

   But the open-air beer halls where older Russian women sell Beerlao,
   "South-East Asia's best brew", are so quiet you can hear Buddhist
   prayers from the Thai temple 500 metres away.

   The heavy police presence underlines the Government's greatest fear -
   of an attack during the summit.

   The US State Department warned in late October that it had received
   information "anti Lao Government groups may be planning to detonate
   several explosive devices in Vientiane" during the summit. It said it
   had no details of specific targets or methods of attack.

   There was a series of small bomb blasts in Laos between February 2003
   and June 2004 and some armed attacks on buses and other vehicles that
   killed at least 12 people.

   Last week two small bombs exploded 16 kilometres south of Vientiane,
   close to the Friendship Bridge that links Thailand to Laos. No one was
   injured. The Government denied it, claiming if an explosion was heard,
   it was probably a festival firecracker.

   To ensure there are no more "false alarms", the Government has banned
   firecrackers during the summit.

   If the city seems strangely quiet, you won't get any complaints from
   the central Government. It is part of the master plan for this
   ill-equipped city to survive the ASEAN summit.

   This week workers were rushing to finish the summit venue, the
   14-storey Don Chan Palace hotel, by far the city's tallest building.
   Doomsayers estimate that even with the new hotel, the city will be 500
   beds short of the number of expected guests. Two hundred electrical
   engineers have been put on 24-hour watch to avert power failures at
   venues.

   ASEAN, the 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations, is not
   what it used to be. Now it is ASEAN plus three (China, Japan and South
   Korea) with debutante guests Australia, New Zealand and India.

   The press corps has been sprinkled across the city in
   backpacker-standard accommodation. The backpackers have been banned
   from the city until the summit closes. Laotians are buying in bulk,
   fearing the city may run out of food if the Government follows through
   on its November 2 announcement to stop all heavy transport, including
   food deliveries, entering the city for the week of the summit. Tuktuks
   are also banned from the city centre.

   Only the police are in good supply. In the centre of town, every 50
   paces you meet a policeman or a soldier, occasionally armed with a
   submachine-gun. Locals say extra police have arrived from the
   provinces. Even stranger is the claim that Vietnamese police have been
   brought in and kitted out with Laos uniforms to bolster numbers.

   For ASEAN's poorest member country, becoming the focus of so much
   attention is a stressful experience.

A welcome relief

   SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER EDITORIAL BOARD

   In tense times, any moves to reduce military tensions provide the world
   some relief. China and Taiwan seem to be turning down the heat. That's
   smart on both their parts.

   Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian, who arrives in Seattle today for an
   overnight visit, announced cancellation Tuesday of a live-fire military
   exercise to practice defending his island from China. Before that, the
   mainland power apparently had canceled or scaled down exercises of its
   own along the Taiwan Straits.

   A heated standoff often makes for good domestic politics in Taiwan and
   in China, but it is one of the more unnecessarily perilous
   relationships in the world. Despite dangerous leanings within the Bush
   administration toward favoring Taiwan, the president and the State
   Department have tried to encourage peace.

   That recognizes reality. The economic and cultural progress made in
   Taiwan and China over recent decades would be lost in any war over
   Taiwan's future. Taiwan, moreover, amazingly has transformed itself
   into a democracy, and has done so without provoking China to war.

   With reasonable leadership on both sides of the Straits, Taiwan can
   remain secure. The political skills President Chen has demonstrated at
   home could be a strong asset if consistently applied to rebuilding a
   calmer relationship with China.

   [t.gif] Powerful tropical storm pummels northern Japan
           [black.gif]

28 dead, 15 missing

        The bow of an Indonesian-registered cargo ship is washed ashore on
                                 Kasado Island in western Japan Wednesday.

   TOKYO – Japan's coast guard on Wednesday found five more bodies from an
   Indonesian cargo ship that ran aground during a powerful typhoon that
   has hammered Japan, raising the death toll from the storm to at least
   28. At least 15 others were missing.

   Public broadcaster NHK said 718 people had been injured, while police
   put the number at 498.

   The tropical storm, which was downgraded Wednesday from a typhoon after
   losing some of its devastating force, was centered at the northern tip
   of Hokkaido island and headed northwest with sustained winds of up to
   67 mph.

   As much as eight inches of rain was forecast for Hokkaido and other
   areas of northern Japan through Wednesday evening, the Meteorological
   Agency said.

   The typhoon carved a path of destruction Tuesday along the country's
   western coast, leaving about 1.6 million households without power,
   demolishing 27 homes and flooding 1,458 buildings, Japanese media said.

   Officials advised 20,000 households to evacuate, Kyodo News reported.

   Power was restored to many homes by Wednesday, although about 390,000
   homes were still without electricity, authorities and utilities said.

   The storm has killed 28 people, while 15 were missing, Kyodo News
   reported.

   Typhoon Songda was the record seventh typhoon to hit Japan this year,
   exceeding the six storms that lashed the country in 1990, the
   Meteorological Agency said.

   The discovery of the five dead sailors brought the death toll on the
   Indonesian ship to 11. The remainder of the 22-member crew of the Tri
   Ardhianto were still missing, a spokesman for the 6th Regional Coast
   Guard Headquarters said on condition of anonymity.

   The 6,300-ton vessel ran aground, broke in half and sank Tuesday as
   Typhoon Songda pummeled southern Japan with powerful winds and high
   waves.

   Stormy seas also sank a Cambodia-registered freighter, Blue Ocean,
   carrying 18 Russian crew in western Hatsukaichi harbor. Fourteen were
   rescued, but two died and two others were still missing, a Hiroshima
   Coast Guard Bureau spokesman said on condition of anonymity.

   A man in his 60s was struck by a windblown tree branch early Wednesday
   and later died at a Sapporo city hospital, Hokkaido prefectural police
   spokesman Akihiro Ishikawa said. An elderly woman also died after being
   hit by flying debris.

   Also in Hokkaido, a man in his 70s was reported missing after he left
   Hakodate port aboard a small boat but failed to return hours later.

   NHK said Wednesday that hundreds of residents along Japan's western
   coast continued to wait out the storm at shelters.

   In western Hiroshima prefecture, officials at Itsukushima shrine began
   extensive repairs to the 13th-century wooden complex. A spokeswoman for
   the shrine said part of the structure's roof had been blown away and a
   large section that sits in the sea at high tide had been torn apart by
   strong waves.

   NHK reported more than 100 flights were canceled nationwide, while most
   train and ferry operators in Hokkaido and other parts of northern Japan
   had halted services.

Iraqi leader urges U.N.’s election aid

   By - The Washington Times - Monday, September 20, 2004

   LONDON — Iraq’s interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, urged the United
   Nations yesterday to do “whatever it takes” to make sure democratic
   elections come off as planned in January.

   Mr. Allawi, embarking on a trans-Atlantic mission to shore up support
   for his government, stopped in London for two days of talks with Prime
   Minister Tony Blair and his government en route to the United States
   for a White House meeting with President Bush and a visit to the United
   Nations in New York.
   [INS: :INS]

   Midway through their meeting yesterday at the prime minister’s Downing
   Street office, the Iraqi leader and Mr. Blair broke off to tell a
   reporters that victory for democracy in Iraq is vital in the fight
   against international terrorism.

   “We are adamant that democracy is going to prevail and is going to win
   in Iraq,” said Mr. Allawi, sounding a confident note despite the
   violence in his country that has left more than 300 people dead in the
   past week alone.

   The horrors continued yesterday when authorities discovered the
   decapitated bodies of three men identified as members of a militia
   associated with the Kurdistan Democratic Party in northern Iraq.

   A militant Web site carried a videotape showing militants chopping the
   head off each man and placing it on his body. An accompanying statement
   claimed responsibility on behalf of the Ansar al-Sunna Army — a Sunni
   group that said it killed 12 Nepalese hostages last month.

   Also yesterday, a suicide car bomb killed three persons in the northern
   city of Samarra, which U.S. forces entered last week for the first time
   in almost four months after negotiating a deal with tribal leaders for
   millions of dollars in reconstruction funds.

   The blast killed an Iraqi soldier, a civilian and the suicide bomber
   and wounded four American and three Iraqi soldiers, Maj. Neal O’Brien
   of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division told the Associated Press.

   In London, both Mr. Allawi and Mr. Blair said the elections set for
   January are the key to restoring stability in Iraq.

   “We definitely are going to stick to the timetable of elections in
   January next year,” Mr. Allawi insisted.

   But the Iraqi leader made it clear that his country needs all the help
   it can get to make that happen. “I call upon the United Nations to help
   us in providing whatever it takes to make the elections a success,” he
   said.

   Mr. Allawi did not elaborate on exactly what sort of help he
   envisioned, but Middle East observers in Britain said that could take
   the form of a request for U.N. observers to help supervise the run-up
   to the elections and possibly peacekeepers to patrol the polling
   stations.

   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan may already be braced for such a
   request. He said last week that the immense problems posed by security
   — or a lack of it — in Iraq could make it impossible to hold “credible
   elections” in the war-torn nation.

   But minutes before Mr. Allawi’s Downing Street meeting, his foreign
   minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, slammed the United Nations for dragging its
   feet.

   “They are not doing enough to help us” organize a framework for the
   elections, he told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a televised
   interview. “Up until now,” Mr. Zebari said, U.N. officials “have only
   about 30 international staffers” in Iraq.

U.S. asks Britain to move troops

   By - The Washington Times - Monday, October 18, 2004

   LONDON — U.S. commanders have asked Britain to shift 650 crack troops
   from southern Iraq to more dangerous positions near Baghdad, freeing
   American troops for an anticipated large-scale assault on the terrorist
   stronghold of Fallujah, officials said.

   Defense Ministry officials said the government had not made a decision
   on the request, which will be announced to the House of Commons by
   British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon today, but other sources said the
   appeal would be “very difficult to refuse.”
   [INS: :INS]

   U.S. forces continued to hammer Fallujah yesterday with missile and
   tank fire, as they have done since city leaders late last week turned
   down a demand from Prime Minister Iyad Allawi that they turn over
   terror mastermind Abu Musab Zarqawi.

   Witnesses reported heavy fighting between U.S. and rebel forces on the
   eastern and southern edges of the city with clashes blocking the main
   road to Baghdad, 40 miles to the east.

   The Associated Press said that a Humvee was seen burning in the eastern
   edge of the city and that hospital officials reported three civilians
   killed. There was no casualty report from the U.S. military.

   The skirmishes were seen as preparatory to a much larger attack on the
   city, designed to re-establish government control over Fallujah, Ramadi
   and other rebel hotbeds ahead of elections scheduled for January.

   Inside Fallujah, hundreds of rebels armed with rocket-propelled grenade
   launchers, machine guns and assault rifles have taken up position along
   the main street awaiting the attack, an Iraqi reporter told The
   Washington Times.

   Fighters are also stationed on the rooftops, and Abdullah Janabi, a
   leader of the rebel Islamic Council that controls the city, warned that
   any “invaders and infidels” would face imminent death, said reporter
   Aqil Jabbar.

   The requested redeployment of British forces would free up the 2nd
   Battalion of the U.S. 24th Marines to take part in the attack on
   Fallujah.

   Britain’s highly regarded Black Watch regiment would replace the
   Marines in the mainly Shi’ite city of Iskandariya, where the United
   States has a base, and the Sunni flash points of Mahmoudiya and
   Latifiya.

   It was in Latifiya that Zarqawi’s Tawhid and Jihad terror group is
   believed to have held and beheaded two American contractors and their
   British colleague Kenneth Bigley. Attackers killed nine Iraqi police
   recruits in the town yesterday as they returned from training in
   Jordan.

   Mr. Hoon, when he briefs Parliament today, can expect a barrage of
   criticism from both the pro-war Conservatives and the smaller but
   growing anti-war Liberal Democrats.

   The Conservatives’ defense spokesman Nicholas Soames has already
   challenged the timing of the deployment, saying it looked like “a
   political gesture,” and charged that the concept of peacekeeping was
   “alien” to the Americans.

   Mr. Soames maintained that British forces would need to have a major
   say in how anti-terrorist operations were carried out or the deployment
   could prompt a backlash that would place British forces in severe and
   unnecessary danger.

   “I can see politically why they want it, but militarily I don’t get
   it,” he said in a television interview last night.

N. Korea threatens more nukes

   By - The Washington Times - Sunday, October 24, 2004

   SEOUL — North Korea warned it will double its nuclear deterrent force
   if the United States persists in challenging the North’s
   nuclear-weapons programs.

   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, en route to Japan on his Asia trip,
   rejected Pyongyang’s demands that the United States “reward” the
   communist country before it will agree to return to six-party
   discussions on its nuclear programs.
   [INS: :INS]

   North Korea, which says it has several atom bombs and insists it needs
   nuclear weapons to deter a U.S. invasion, said yesterday that talks can
   recommence only when Washington drops its “hostile policy” and promises
   a “reward for freeze” on its nuclear activities.

   “If the U.S. persistently pursues its confrontational, hostile policy
   toward the DPRK from the viewpoint of escapism, it will only compel the
   DPRK todouble its deterrent force, much less any solution to the
   nuclear issue,” Pyongyang’s official Rodong newspaper said, using the
   acronym for Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s official
   name.

   On his weekend trip, Mr. Powell intends to consult with Japan, China
   and South Korea on how to assure the North that Washington is not
   interested in attacking the country and on how to revive the stalled
   multilateral talks.

   The six-party negotiations include the two Koreas, the United States,
   Russia, China and Japan. Three rounds of talks, held in Beijing, have
   yielded little progress. A fourth round was set for September, but
   North Korea refused to attend.

   Pyongyang dismissed Powell’s Asian trip as pre-U.S. election trickery.

   The nuclear negotiations started after U.S. officials said North Korea
   admitted to running a secret atomic bomb program in violation of
   international agreements. That assertion prompted President Bush to say
   North Korea was part of an “axis of evil” with Iran and prewar Iraq.

   Some U.S. intelligence analysts say North Korea may have up to six
   nuclear weapons instead of the one or two the Central Intelligence
   Agency estimates. North Korea says it has several plutonium-based
   nuclear weapons and denies U.S. charges that it admitted having a
   secret uranium-based nuclear-weapons program.

   North Korea sneered yesterday at Mr. Powell’s trip, with a spokesman
   from its Foreign Ministry describing Washington’s diplomatic effort as
   a “sleight of hand in the run-up to the [U.S.] presidential elections.”

   The North also demands that the six-nation talks address its charges
   that South Korea is developing nuclear weapons. Seoul denies the
   accusations, although it recently admitted its scientists had conducted
   secret nuclear experiments in the past.

   “The resumption of the six-party talks depends on whether the U.S. is
   ready to fully consider the demands raised by the DPRK,” the Foreign
   Ministry spokesman said. Washington has said it would provide economic
   benefits to the North once Pyongyang has demonstrated a credible
   commitment to permanent and verifiable disarmament.

   The visit could well be Mr. Powell’s last to East Asia because it was
   scheduled within two weeks of the U.S. presidential election. The
   timing of his trip could be intended as an attempt to show resolve on
   one of the U.S. government’s most difficult foreign-policy issues.

   The Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. John Kerry, contends that
   the government has mishandled the North Korean problem and should have
   embraced former President Bill Clinton’s policy of bilateral talks with
   Pyongyang rather than the six-nation talks.

   Jailed Palestinian leads election polls
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Opinion polls published Monday showed that
   jailed Palestinian uprising leader Marwan Barghouti poses a threat to
   mainstream candidate Mahmoud Abbas in the Jan. 9 presidential election
   to replace Yasser Arafat.
   [clear.gif]
   [barghouti.jpg] [clear.gif] A poll by the West Bank's Bir Zeit
   University indicates 35% of respondents say they support Barghouti,
   compared to 34% for Abbas. [clear.gif]
   By Brennan Linsley, AP

   However, Barghouti's associates say he might yet withdraw in exchange
   for reform promises from Abbas.

   The polls are the first since Barghouti threw the election scene into
   turmoil by entering the race just before the filing deadline. Barghouti
   is serving five life terms in an Israeli prison for his role in deadly
   shooting attacks of Israelis.

   Abbas, 69, a pragmatist who has spoken out against violence and enjoys
   the tacit support of the international community, is the candidate of
   the ruling Fatah movement.

   Two of the polls published Monday predicted a tight race between Abbas
   and Barghouti, while a third gave Abbas the advantage.

   In a poll by the West Bank's Bir Zeit University, 35% of respondents
   said they supported Barghouti, compared to 34% for Abbas. Another poll
   by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, headed by
   independent pollster Khalil Shikaki, said Abbas had 40% support,
   compared with 38% for Barghouti. The results of both polls fell within
   the margin of error of 3 percentage points.

   Only one poll, by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion run by
   pollster Nabil Kukali, gave Abbas a comfortable lead of 40%, compared
   to 22% for Barghouti. That poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage
   points.

   Barghouti, 45, the West Bank leader of Fatah, was captured in Ramallah
   in 2002 and is the highest Palestinian official in Israeli custody.
   Because Abbas was already the official Fatah candidate. Barghouti was
   forced to run as an independent.

   Barghouti's candidacy raised stiff opposition from mainstream Fatah
   officials and some younger leaders, charging the fiery, charismatic
   candidate would split the party and cause internal conflict.

   On Monday, Fatah threatened to strip Barghouti of his membership if he
   continues his bid for the Palestinian presidency.

   Farouk Kaddoumi, who succeeded the late Yasser Arafat as Fatah chief,
   said the party would ban any member who did not abide by the decisions
   of its central committee, according to a statement from Kaddoumi's
   office in Tunis, Tunisia, where he is based.

   "Any Fatah member who deliberately sets himself apart from decisions of
   its central committee is considered to have resigned his membership ...
   regardless of rank," the statement said.

   At the office of the "Free Marwan Barghouti" drive in Ramallah on
   Monday, backers were turning their operation into a temporary
   presidential campaign headquarters.

   For now, activist Saed Nimr is the campaign manager, but a permanent
   director is to be named this week — indicating Barghouti is in the race
   to stay.

   Nimr said the fact that Barghouti is in prison would not stop him from
   serving as president. "He will appoint a strong prime minister and a
   strong vice president," Nimr said. "They will be visiting him from week
   to week to get instructions."

   However, Palestinian officials say that according to the Palestinian
   constitution, Barghouti cannot serve as president from prison, because
   one of the president's legal obligations is to attend sessions of the
   Palestinian parliament.

   Palestinian Cabinet minister Kadoura Fares, who is close to Barghouti,
   raised the possibility Barghouti might withdraw in exchange for
   promises by Abbas to give a greater say to young Fatah activists.

   "A month is a long time," Fares said. "If Barghouti withdraws his
   candidacy and lets Abu Mazen (Abbas) win, it shows that Abu Mazen needs
   to forge an alliance with the younger generation."

   Another Barghouti backer, Ahmed Ghneim, said it's conceivable his
   candidate might drop out.

   "This is being discussed, but Marwan said he insists that he wants to
   continue," he said, "but there is a lot of talk going on about this
   issue, we are discussing the issue. And nothing is out of the
   question."

   The Bir Zeit poll indicated support for Barghouti is particularly
   strong among women, youths, villagers, the poor and the less educated.
   Abbas scored higher among men, the middle-class, the elderly, the
   educated and city residents.

   Abbas is more popular in Gaza, while Barghouti scored higher in the
   West Bank.

   All three polls were conducted after last Wednesday's deadline for
   announcing candidacies. In all, there are 10 contenders for Palestinian
   Authority president. In all three surveys, pro-democracy activist
   Mustafa Barghouti, an independent, came in third, with support ranging
   from 6% to 14%.

   Shikaki said his poll showed in general that Fatah has gained in
   popularity at the expense of the militant Islamic Hamas, which is
   boycotting the election. Shikaki said part of the rise is a sympathy
   vote after Arafat's death.

   Also, he said, "the findings show that the public is more optimistic
   about the future than it has been at any time during the past four

   Four Filipinos survive 10 days in rubble
   MANILA (AP) — Maria Tamares constantly feared the tiny, pitch-black
   crevice under tons of mud and logs would be her grave — and that of her
   3-year-old granddaughter and three others trapped for 10 days under
   storm-loosened rubble.

   One person died beside Tamares, pleading for water. The dirty trickle
   that at first found its way through the cracks quickly dried up,
   forcing the survivors to lick the ground and a moist concrete slab.

   Then, just when death seemed imminent, they heard tapping above them
   and yelled for help.

   In a rescue seen by many as a miracle, soldiers and villagers pulled
   Tamares, her granddaughter and two neighbors from the debris Thursday
   of a two-story building buried under landslides unleashed by fierce
   wind and rain.

   A back-to-back storm and typhoon raged through the northeastern
   Philippines last week, killing at least 842 people.

   The discovery of the 49-year-old Tamares and the other stunned
   survivors — all severely dehydrated but suffering only minor bruises —
   stirred hope that others of the more than 750 missing could be found
   alive. (Related story: 842 confirmed dead)

   "We prayed and prayed and prayed. We felt like we were entombed between
   heaven and earth," Tamares said by telephone from her hospital bed in
   Lucena, where the survivors were brought by helicopter after being
   extricated from the rubble in the town of Real, 40 miles east of
   Manila.

   "There was nothing but darkness, no food, but droplets of water, and I
   thought our time had come," said Tamares, sobbing as she recalled the
   ordeal.

   The nightmare started Nov. 29 when howling winds and flash floods
   triggered mudslides that pounded her home, forcing Tamares to dash
   outside with one of her two granddaughters, Estella Marie Sor.

   Tamares' daughter took another granddaughter elsewhere and both died in
   the storm, she said.

   Tamares sought refuge with dozens of others in a roadside building
   between a hill and the sea.

   But mudslides brought logs and other debris crashing down on the
   concrete building, burying those inside.

   Tamares, her granddaughter, a male relative in his 60s and two male
   neighbors were trapped in an air pocket, a space so cramped they could
   only lie on their backs. They initially used a pot to collect water
   dripping through cracks.

   The water soon dried up and they were forced to wet their lips by
   licking moisture from the ground and a concrete beam. Tamares' relative
   died beside her after three days. His decaying body filled the dark
   void with an unimaginable stench, she said.

   "We turned to our side from time to time because our backs began to
   hurt. We relieved ourselves while lying down without taking off our
   clothes because the cramped space did not allow much movement," she
   said. "We drank our urine."

   When the limited air made breathing difficult, Tamares said, she lost
   hope and asked God to take care of them in death. "My granddaughter,
   the two others pleaded for me not to harbor thoughts of death," she
   said. "They said 'God will guide us out of here.'"

   Then the unbelievable happened.

   "We heard some pounding above us and we yelled, 'Help us! Help us!
   We're alive in here!' and they found us," she said. "It was a miracle.
   Thank God, he gave us a second life."

   The military said in a statement that soldiers and miners removing
   decomposing bodies from the rubble heard the desperate calls. They used
   a backhoe to break a hole in a concrete slab, and found Tamares and the
   others.

   The crowd of rescuers burst into applause as the emaciated survivors
   were pulled out.

   As Tamares lay on a warm, dry blanket beside the hole, a woman dabbed
   her lips with wet cotton. Surrounded by a frenzy of celebration, she
   managed to smile, tears streaming down her face.

Iraq Chief Gives 'Final Warning' to Rebel Cleric

By JOHN F. BURNS

Published: August 20, 2004

   BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 19 - Prime Minister Ayad Allawi gave what he
   described as a final warning on Thursday to the rebel Shiite cleric
   Moktada al-Sadr, saying the cleric should move quickly to fulfill his
   vow to disarm and leave the shrine in Najaf where his followers have
   been battling American troops for the last two weeks.

   The warning was accompanied by a major intensification of American
   military attacks on targets in Najaf's Old City, around the Imam Ali
   shrine, with bombing strikes and an artillery barrage that lasted deep
   into Thursday night and lit the sky with bursts of flame and smoke.

   An accompanying offensive in Mr. Sadr's other major stronghold, the
   Baghdad slum of Sadr City, saw American troops and armor pushing deep
   into the heart of the intensely populated district, scattering
   militiamen who have had a virtually uncontested run of the area for
   months.

   With senior officials of the American-led military alliance saying the
   decision on whether to storm the Najaf shrine was one for Dr. Allawi,
   not for the United States, there were growing signs that Iraq's
   provisional government leader was ready to move beyond threats. Aides
   to Dr. Allawi said an assault led by Iraqi troops, backed by American
   troops and airpower, could come in days if Mr. Sadr backtracked, as he
   has before, on the pledge to disband his militia and vacate the shrine.

   "This is the final call to them to disarm, vacate the holy shrine, and
   engage in political work," Dr. Allawi said at a news conference in
   Baghdad's heavily protected international zone, where the new
   government has its principal offices alongside buildings that are the
   seat of American military and political power. "We have left the doors
   open, and we hope he will abide by the rule of law."

   Mr. Sadr, out of sight somewhere in Najaf, sent out conflicting
   signals. One aide, Sheik Ahmed al-Shaibani, told reporters in Najaf on
   Thursday that the terms set by a delegation of Iraqi clerics and
   politicians who visited the shrine on Tuesday - essentially those
   restated by Dr. Allawi to reporters today - had become untenable. "It's
   very clear that we reject them," he said.

   But another cleric, Ali Smeisim, said Mr. Sadr was committed to
   fulfilling the delegation's terms. "By so doing, we have put the ball
   in Dr. Allawi's court," he said.

   Later in the day, a report by Agence France-Presse from Najaf, quoting
   a new letter said to have been written by Mr. Sadr to his followers,
   quoted him as saying he would not disarm his militia force, known as
   the Mahdi Army.

   "Everyone knows this army is the foundation of the Imam Mahdi, and I
   don't have the right to dissolve it," he said, referring to the 12th
   Shiite imam, a ninth century leader of the sect who Shiites believe
   will one day manifest himself on earth again as the mahdi, or messiah.

   A Western official here said Iraqi officials were "trying to figure
   out" precisely what Mr. Sadr had committed himself to in an earlier
   letter read to a national political conference in Baghdad on Tuesday.
   The letter was taken by many of the delegates as an agreement to end
   the Najaf crisis by disarming, but Mr. Sadr's aides threw doubts on
   that immediately by stipulating that American and Iraqi forces would
   have to pull back from positions in Najaf's Old City before steps would
   be taken to meet Mr. Sadr's side of the deal.

   A top Sadr aide issued a plea to the kidnappers of Micah Garen, the
   36-year-old American journalist who was taken hostage last week in the
   southern city of Nasiriya.

   The Associated Press quoted the aide, Sheik Aws al-Khafaji, as saying
   the Mahdi Army was against kidnapping, "especially this journalist who
   rendered Nasiriya great service." This appeared to be a reference to
   Mr. Garen's efforts over the last year to film the looting of
   archaeological sites near Nasiriya that are treasured for what they
   have revealed of the Sumerian civilization, going back as far as 5,000
   years.

   Mr. Khafaji's remarks aligned with the position taken recently by Mr.
   Sadr, who condemned the spate of kidnappings of foreigners across Iraq,
   some of which have ended in beheadings, calling them un-Islamic. Last
   weekend, clerics loyal to Mr. Sadr intervened to free a British
   journalist, who had been kidnapped from a hotel in the southern city of
   Basra, and appeared with the reporter at a news conference, claiming
   credit for his release. The American military's attempt to increase
   pressure on Mr. Sadr appeared to be focused on bombing and shelling
   rebel strongholds within a few hundred yards of the Sadr stronghold in
   the Imam Ali Mosque, the holiest Shiite shrine in Iraq. An AC-130
   gunship pounded rebel positions from above, while tanks and armored
   vehicles fired in the streets.

   Before the attacks on Thursday night, American troops and Sadr
   militiamen had traded volleys of gunfire in the Old City, and three
   mortars apparently fired by the rebels struck a police station, killing
   seven police officers and wounding at least two dozen others.

   The wounded police officers were treated at Najaf's central hospital
   before being transported to the American base on the city's northern
   outskirts for further treatment. Some were then flown aboard American
   medevac helicopters to a military hospital in Baghdad.

Blair recovering after heartbeat-correction procedure

   Associated Press

   LONDON -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair underwent a successful
   operation today to correct an irregular heartbeat and was recovering at
   home, a hospital official said.

   Simon Wilde, a spokesman for Hammersmith Hospital in west London, also
   said Blair would have a "rapid and complete recovery" and there was a
   low risk the problem would recur.

   "The procedure was successful in eliminating the atrial flutter," Wilde
   said.

   Medical experts said the 2 1/2-hour operation, carried out under local
   anesthetic, was a safe, routine procedure. Aides have stressed that
   Blair will be back at his desk Monday and intends to go ahead with a
   planned trip to Africa on Tuesday.

   "I think today our thoughts are with Mr. Blair, with his family and
   with the recovery that everybody hopes that he has from this
   operation," Treasury chief Gordon Brown told the British Broadcasting
   Corp. from Washington, where he is attending the annual meeting of the
   International Monetary Fund.

   Blair, 51, looked relaxed as he was driven away from his Downing Street
   residence, accompanied by his wife, Cherie, in an official car at about
   7 a.m. today. He told reporters he felt fine.

   "It's a sort of fluttering. It doesn't stop you working, and indeed
   I've been working the last couple of months since it happened," Blair
   said Thursday night, just hours after appearing onstage for the closing
   ceremony of his Labour Party's annual convention. "I'm going to go in
   and have this routine operation."

   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott stood in for Blair while he
   underwent the operation.

   Prescott stressed that Blair, who announced Thursday he intends to
   serve another five years, is still up to the job and could serve a
   third term if his party wins national elections expected next year.

   "We have known about this condition for some period of time and he has
   been operating through probably one of his most difficult periods in
   politics, always bouncing back, dealing with these problems," Prescott
   said. "This is an extraordinary man who has got the energies to deal
   with it. That hasn't changed whatsoever."

   Blair's condition is called supraventricular tachycardia. It is caused
   by rapid electrical activity in the upper parts of the heart and
   results in a sometimes irregular, rapid heartbeat.

   The procedure involves inserting a catheter through the groin and up to
   the heart, where radio-frequency energy is used to kill off the cells
   conducting the extra impulses.

   The British Heart Foundation said the condition, which may be
   accompanied by shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting, can be
   distressing for the patient but is not considered serious.

   "Many people experience them at some time, even if they have no
   evidence of heart disease," spokeswoman Cathy Ross said.

   President Bush, Blair's close friend and ally, sent his best wishes.

   "The president's thoughts and prayers are with prime minister. He
   wishes him a speedy recovery," White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan
   said.

   Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he prayed for Blair's "quick and
   full recovery, so that you can continue your brave efforts toward
   making the world a better place for all of us."

   Blair has had his toughest two years as prime minister, facing intense
   opposition -- even from his own party -- to his support for the
   U.S.-led war in Iraq. The war overshadowed this week's convention, and
   Blair is battling to unite his party as it aims to seek a third term in
   power.

   His announcement Thursday that he would serve a full third term
   followed months of speculation that he intended to step down midway
   through it and pass the baton to Brown.

   "If I'm elected I would serve a third term," Blair said. "I do not want
   to serve a fourth term, I don't think the British people want a prime
   minister to go on that long but I think it's sensible to make plain my
   intention now."

   He took office in 1997, and his Labour Party also won elections in
   2001.

   Blair's procedure comes less than a month after his 58-year-old former
   colleague in the White House, Bill Clinton, underwent quadruple bypass
   surgery in New York.

   Blair has seen his popularity slump since the Iraq war and the U.S.-led
   coalition's failure to find evidence supporting his prewar contention
   that Saddam Hussein possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass
   destruction.

   During a speech to his party's conference Tuesday, Blair acknowledged
   British intelligence on the weapons threat posed by Iraq was wrong, but
   he pointedly refused to apologize for toppling Saddam, insisting the
   world was safer with him in prison.

   But the usually bullish and defiant prime minister was contrite.

   "I'm like any other human being, as fallible and as capable of being
   wrong," he said, insisting that he went to war to protect Britain's
   security.

   A spokeswoman for the prime minister also confirmed today that the
   Blairs had bought a house in London's exclusive Connaught Square,
   paying $6.5 million for the property. They purchased it "for their
   future," and none of the Blair family planned to move in immediately,
   she said.

   Rumsfeld warns on US spy shake-up
   By Nick Childs
   BBC Pentagon correspondent

   Donald Rumsfeld
   Mr Rumsfeld expressed his misgivings about the proposal

   US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has warned against creating new
   barriers between US intelligence and military commanders.

   He was testifying in the Senate on the report of the commission
   investigating the 11 September 2001 attacks.

   Its recommendations included creating a new national intelligence
   director.

   Both President George W Bush and his Democratic rival John Kerry have
   embraced the idea, but Mr Rumsfeld has misgivings about how it is done.

   Those doubts were on display again as he testified before the Senate
   armed services committee.

   Mr Rumsfeld insists he does back the idea, but he cautioned that any
   intelligence reforms should not create additional problems, such as new
   barriers between intelligence agencies and senior military commanders.

   If we move unwisely and get it wrong, the penalty would be great

   Donald Rumsfeld

   Some see this as an effort to protect the Pentagon's position.

   It is the biggest consumer of intelligence and currently controls over
   80% of the US intelligence budget.

   Responding to the recommendations of the 11 September commission is
   turning into an important test in the US presidential election.

   Mr Rumsfeld said it was important to move with "all deliberate speed"
   on intelligence reform, but he said these issues are being considered
   in time of war and that the penalty of moving unwisely would be great.

   He suggested that his priorities include improving analysis and human
   intelligence.

   Northern Cyprus trade ban lifted
   By Tabitha Morgan
   BBC, Nicosia

   Turkish Cypriots at Yes campaign rally
   Turkish Cypriots had voted for reunification of the island

   Turkish Cypriots have begun trading with their Greek Cypriot
   compatriots in the south of the island for the first time in three
   decades.

   The introduction of inter-island trade is part of a package of EU
   measures to boost the economy of northern Cyprus.

   It comes after Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of reuniting the island
   in a poll last April.

   But the rejection of reunification by Greek Cypriots meant the north
   remained excluded from the EU.

   Less than an hour after the legislation was introduced, vegetable
   farmers and textile manufacturers were lining up to register their
   products.

   Economic isolation

   It is hoped the measures may help to end the economic isolation of
   northern Cyprus.

   But Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, who was voted into office
   on a promise to get northern Cyprus into the EU, says this is not
   enough.

   He wants to see the introduction of direct trade between northern
   Cyprus and EU countries.

   Direct trade was originally proposed in an effort to boost the Turkish
   Cypriot economy after northern Cyprus was excluded from the EU by the
   Greek Cypriots' rejection of reunification.

   But after the Republic of Cyprus registered strong opposition to direct
   trade, Brussels postponed a final decision on the measures until next
   month.

   Unless Mr Talat can deliver some more far-reaching economic benefits
   soon, his fragile coalition government may start to look rather
   vulnerable.

   Fed officials ease oil concerns

   Oil traders in new York
   The oil market has had little time to pause during the past months

   A recovery in the world's largest economy is likely to continue,
   despite oil prices surging to record levels, US Federal Reserve
   officials said.

   Speaking on US television on Monday night, Fed governor Ben Bernanke
   said that while higher oil costs may slow expansion, they would not
   derail it.

   Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert McTeer echoed this
   optimism during a separate TV appearance.

   Markets have become jittery in past weeks amid concerns about oil
   supply.

   Positive signs

   The Fed, which raised US interest rates two weeks ago, is more
   optimistic about the outlook.

   "There's going to be a little bit of a slowdown effect," Mr Bernanke
   said during an interview on PBS's 'Nightly Business Report'.

   Why are oil prices so high?

   "But at current levels, anyway, I think it won't derail what looks like
   a self-sustaining expansion at this point."

   He added that consumer spending "has picked up fairly considerably...
   and that is going to support growth going forward".

   On business channel CNBC, Mr McTeer also underlined the robustness of
   the US economy.

   "I don't think it is in jeopardy," he said. Growth "is self -sustaining
   and it's not terribly fragile".

   Off the boil

   Helping soothe investors' nerves further, the price of oil on Monday
   fell back from recent record highs after pumping in northern Iraq
   resumed.

   Southern exports also are returning to normal levels following militia
   threats to pipelines.

   Oil trader on the London International Petroleum Exchange
   Oil prices are causing headaches

   A barrel of New York light crude fell 67 cents to $46.05, while in
   London, benchmark Brent Crude slid 51 cents to $43.03.

   Analysts said that any dip may be short term and prices still may top
   the $50-a-barrel mark.

   Prices are buoyed by the fact that the majority of producer countries
   are pumping oil flat out, while demand is being stoked by booming
   growth in countries such as China and India.

   That leaves very little room for manoeuvre should there be any
   disruption to output.

   A number of companies, governments and analysts have warned that the
   subsequent higher fuel and raw material costs are likely to dent
   profits and may force them to trim growth forecasts.

   S Korea in 'secret' nuclear trial
   By Charles Scanlon
   BBC correspondent in Seoul
   The South Korean Government has admitted its scientists experimented
   secretly with nuclear fuel enrichment.

   Experts say the technique used could have military implications, but a
   government official denied any intention to build a weapons programme.

   A European based diplomat said the work was a violation of South
   Korea's international nuclear commitments.

   The discovery could lead to calls for South Korea to be referred to the
   UN Security Council, like North Korea.

   It is also likely to cause severe embarrassment to Seoul, and its key
   ally the US.

   A team of inspectors from the IAEA secretly rushed to South Korea last
   week, after the government revealed that the country had broken its
   commitments on nuclear proliferation.

   According to the ROK (South Korea), these activities were carried out
   without the government´s knowledge at a nuclear site in Korea in 2000

   IAEA statement

   Seoul made the admission under the terms of a tougher inspection regime
   that is just coming into effect.

   A South Korean government official told the BBC that the research,
   which involved the use of lasers to enrich nuclear fuel, was not
   authorised by the government.

   The official said it was a "rogue" operation which ended four years
   ago, and concerned the production of a tiny amount of highly enriched
   uranium, which could be used for an atomic bomb.

   The official said the research was for the domestic production of
   nuclear fuel for the country's civil programme.

   However, according to analysts, there is no credible civilian use for
   the technique, which uses lasers to create weapons-grade uranium.

   'Same as Iran'

   South Korean officials said the government only found out about the
   experiments in the last few months, and were now investigating the
   scientists responsible.

   A European-based diplomat said their actions were a clear violation of
   the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and could put South Korea into
   the same category as Iran.

   South Korea abandoned a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s, under
   intense pressure from the United States.

   It has since committed itself to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and
   has been at the forefront of efforts to persuade North Korea to give up
   its development of atomic bombs.

   The finding is likely to cause deep embarrassment to the US, which
   regards Seoul as a close ally in its attempts to persuade the North to
   abandon its nuclear ambitions.

   According to IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky, the inspectors will leave
   South Korea early next week, and their findings will be presented to
   the agency's Board of Governors on 13 September.

   Anwar Ibrahim freed: Your views

   Anwar Ibrahim at a press conference after his release

   The former Malaysian deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has been
   freed from jail after the country's highest court overturned his
   conviction for sodomy.

   Mr Anwar, who had always said the charges against him were politically
   motivated, was sacked six years ago by former Prime Minister Mahathir
   Mohammed, his mentor turned rival, following a row over the economy.

   After leading a large anti-government protest he was arrested and in
   1999 jailed for six years for corruption.

   In 2000 Mr Anwar received a further nine years for sodomy - to be
   served concurrently with his corruption sentence. He had already failed
   to reverse the first of those convictions and finished serving his
   sentence for corruption last year.

   What does Mr Anwar's freedom mean for Malaysia? Is he still a potent
   political force, or has his power waned during his long jail term? Send
   us your views.

   This debate is now closed. Thank you for your comments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The following comments reflect the balance of views we received:

   Maybe it is a ploy to gain sympathy and respect from the people by
   Badawi, and to distance himself to some extent from Mahathir. But, it
   is the right thing to do, and is long overdue. I hope that the
   corruption charge is also overturned, allowing Mr Anwar to return to
   politics soon. The first priority now is his health, and provided that
   is stabilised I can see no doubt that Anwar will return to politics as
   soon as he can, and will be instrumental in much-needed reform in
   Malaysia. Eugene of Bournemouth needs to study the situation, or live
   in Malaysia, in order to realise that "political scenes" are far from
   identical everywhere in the world. To state that "the judiciary system
   in Malaysia is no doubt one of the most advanced in the world and is
   independent from the government" is a very naive and idealistic
   statement.
   Liz Mulqueen, Bangkok, Thailand

   (1) The judicial system of Malaysia has overturned Mr Anwar's sentence
   for sodomy. (2) Mr Anwar has served his sentence for corruption. (3)
   Having spent more than a year in prison, Mr Anwar is illegible for
   parliament for the next five years. (4) The Malaysian economy, after
   not following Mr Anwar's recommendations at the time he was DPM, is now
   one of the most vibrant in South East Asia and beyond. Mr Anwar's
   political clout depends on what Malaysians make of the above 4 points
   among others. Personally, I would think that the present regime has not
   been doing too badly after the masterstroke following the South East
   Asian crisis.
   Kpdodo, Mauritius

   I'm sad to hear one of the people contributing to this debate said that
   Anwar's overzealous supporters led to violent protest. I was
   accidentally with them and what I witnessed was the FRU and the Special
   Branch Police who provoked and started the violence. Otherwise, the
   protest could have been in control. Anyway, welcome back as a free man,
   Anwar.
   Zifose, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   As a Malaysian, I feel this is a victory for all Malaysians
   irrespective of their political ideology

   Fandi Othman, Oxford

   Malaysia strives to be a leader in the world scene. This landmark
   ruling means that Malaysia is committed in reforming its own
   administrative system. Hence it can serve to be an example to the third
   world countries it is leading. As a Malaysian, I feel this is a victory
   for all Malaysians irrespective of their political ideology. I believe
   that Malaysia will indeed be a truly great nation. A nation where
   democracy prevails and the people have a freedom in deciding their own
   lives.
   Fandi Othman, Oxford

   Contrary to all the odes to the apparent new-found freedom of the
   judiciary, Anwar was released simply because he is no longer a
   immediate threat to the government

   Lee Khee Gan, Kuala Lumpur

   This whole charade is but yet another chapter in the whole shadow-play
   that is Malaysian politics. Contrary to all the odes to the apparent
   new-found freedom of the judiciary, Anwar was released simply because
   he is no longer a immediate threat to the government, and denying him
   medical treatment will make the Malaysian government an international
   pariah. As far as I'm concerned, this is just a ploy by the
   powers-that-be to gain political brownie points both locally and
   abroad. If Anwar is still a viable threat to the establishment, the
   yes-men in the judiciary wouldn't have been told to dismiss his
   conviction, period. As it is, Anwar cannot take part in politics for
   five years thanks to the law which states that anyone imprisoned for
   more than 12 months is disqualified. What a cynical yet brilliant
   masterstroke by the government.
   Lee Khee Gan, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   He is freed at last, thanks to Mighty good and I hope more justice will
   prevail after this. Six years in prison was a big pain for him and his
   family. For Mahathir and his team, I think he won't be sleeping well
   after this.
   Anon, Malaysia

   It means Malaysia still has a fighting chance of becoming a great
   nation.
   CK, Selangor, Malaysia

   The one person that comes out stronger with this decision is Prime
   Minister Abdullah Badawi

   Dollah Ali, Kuala Lumpur

   The one person that comes out stronger with this decision is Prime
   Minister Abdullah Badawi. With one stroke, he brought back confidence
   to the judiciary. Investors looked at it very positively. With the
   formal endorsement of his Presidency three weeks away, he is clearly
   setting himself away and perhaps reversing the much talked grip of his
   predecessors. In due time, Abdullah is quite capable of bringing the
   much needed reform for the country. Anwar with his wretched track
   record is in no position to talk of reform.
   Dollah Ali, Kuala Lumpur

   I grew up in Malaysia, and was outraged by the treatment Anwar received
   at the hands of Mahatir. I think Anwar still has a large amount of
   support, but as far as I am aware, convicted criminals in the country
   are banned from running for office for several years after being
   released from jail.
   Stu Smith, London, UK

   It is return of a roaring political tiger who can cement a vibrant
   growth right in local economical scene as well as at international
   arena! He is still very relevant to revitalise the political stability
   in Malaysia. He has a proven track record that he is the ultimate
   person who can rationally rule the country whereby he is not second to
   any past, current and future leaders in Malaysia. I would like to
   stress that it is important to pass the baton to the winning runner of
   Malaysia. He is a political guru of modern Malaysia! Can anyone finger
   point to any other leaders in Malaysia who ready to make a lot of
   sacrifices regardless of reasons in Malaysia's political scenario!
   Kumar, Kuala Lumpur

   Thank God that Anwar is free and wish him and his family a happy and
   harmonious life. However the real winner is our beloved Prime Minister
   Pak Lah. God bless Malaysia
   Peter, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia

   I didn't hear him call the judges spineless and government lackey.
   Obviously, they are not when he gets his way. Aren't they part of the
   same judiciary system?
   Zainon Ali, Johor Baru, Malaysia

   Regardless of the political tumult that has befallen Malaysia due to
   the power struggle between to influential leaders, it is fundamental to
   understand there are deeper flaws within the fabric of the Malaysian
   society that has spawned this little crisis. As far as I am concerned,
   none of this matters, for true stability can only be achieved by social
   education and not by just economic and infrastructural might. Let not
   this minor news lead us astray from the meaning of true liberty and not
   the one celebrated in a festive mood.
   Agoy Nibar, Port Dickson

   It is the survival of the fittest, which applies in political scenes
   everywhere in the world

   Eugene, Bournemouth

   Why people seem to think that PM Abdullah Badawi has the judicial power
   to influence the court's sentencing? The judiciary system in Malaysia
   is no doubt one of the most advanced in the world and is independent
   from the government. If one thinks that Badawi is in a position to
   release Anwar, then one should not blame Mahathir for his position to
   jail Anwar. Even though what had happened is unfortunate, it is hard to
   draw a line who is right or wrong in this political affair. It is the
   survival of the fittest, which applies in political scenes everywhere
   in the world.
   Eugene, Bournemouth, UK

   In reflecting on this case, and even though the Malaysian Court has
   found that there was no safe evidence that Mr Anwar was guilty of
   sodomy, we should not forget that sodomy laws criminalise the loving
   sexual behaviour of Malaysia's gay community. Whatever views are held
   by individuals on homosexuality, sodomy laws should be removed from the
   statute books.
   Stephen Harte, Edinburgh, Scotland

   I don't understand why people are thanking Badawi and the government

   KK Aw, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia

   I don't understand why people are thanking Badawi and the government.
   They should thank the two judges who had the guts to make this
   decision. If Badawi has interfered with the court then he is just as
   bad as Dr. M. Just because you like the judgement, does not make it
   right.
   KK Aw, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia

   Anwar is free, finally. Maybe we now can concentrate on the rebuilding
   of Malaysian system of governance which the original reformasi/reform
   movement was about, to bring back an independent judiciary and
   independent media of the country. I hope Mr Anwar will not forget that
   his freedom was not only won by his lawyers but by constant pressure
   from politicians, internet media and people on the current government
   to look again to the facts of his case. We hope Mr Anwar will not
   forget countless people who were moved by his ideals, and joined him
   when he first made the permatang pauh declarations. Some of these
   people paid with their lives during the Mahathir regime. Some paid by
   doing jail time. He has to carry on his reforms for the good of the
   nation and the good of the world in general. Mr Anwar earned this.
   Anon, Malaysia/

   My heart goes out to Anwar's family, especially his wife Aziza and
   children. As a journalist having covered most of the events 5-6 years
   ago (Reformasi protest, arrest, trial and sentence), I felt for Aziza
   (MP), children as well as Anwar's father who were deeply hurt through
   the ordeal. I can't even imagine the immensity of their joy. The
   charismatic leader of the Reformasi movement returns!
   Michael, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

   The Malaysian Judiciary system is finally being transparent

   Kasthuri Patto, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   The Malaysian Judiciary system is finally being transparent with their
   cases - especially high profile ones like this. A warm congratulations
   to Anwar and his family for their continuous struggle to uphold justice
   in a country where the leader rules with an almost iron fist masked by
   democracy. This will pave way for a more just, liberal and democratic
   legal system in the future.
   Kasthuri Patto, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   It is premature to make comments on the 'improvement' of freedom in
   Malaysia. Of course Anwar's release is a bit of relief, but what about
   those innocent ISA (Internal Security Act) detainees? I don't think we
   are even nearer to the so called 'freedom' yet.
   Nizam, PJ

   As a 15 year old living in the land of multi-racial freedom, I hope
   Anwar's supporters will not disturb the peace as it is now. I certainly
   do hope he doesn't involve himself in politics again. After all, better
   safe than sorry.
   Andrew Leng, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   Anwar's release is just what is required to restore our faith in
   Malaysia's judicial system. More significantly, Anwar's release has
   strengthened Abdullah Badawi's position as a leader of integrity and
   honesty - rightfully and deservedly so.
   John Ferguson, Putney, London UK

   His freedom should mean more freedom for Malaysians

   Ibroe Alli, Kuching, Malaysia

   His freedom should mean more freedom for Malaysians. It is actually a
   win-win situation for both Anwar and Abdullah. We need checks and
   balances and Anwar is the right candidate to do that to our government.
   Mahathir on the one hand showed his stubbornness as usual. But he is
   gone for good. To me, Mahathir is too emotional in some decision
   makings. What happened today should be cherished by all Malaysians as
   our judiciary system now is more transparent and independent.
   Ibroe Alli, Kuching, Malaysia

   Whatever it is, his political career is gone. Whether his absence in
   the government is a blessing for the country is debatable. He is now
   being acquitted but his credibility on his personal behaviour is
   already dented and it is difficult to erase the "black memory" of this
   whole affair. It is a pity! In the final analysis, yes, justice is
   being done. Make no mistake about it.
   Kamarudin, Malaysia

   The problem with Malaysia's political and judicial systems is that it
   resembles those of other Muslim countries. In such systems it is almost
   impossible to oppose or unseat a national leader without causing
   political instability. In short, Mr Anwar Ibrahim should understand
   that a leader of a Muslim country cannot be opposed using the Western
   democratic thinking and philosophies. If he still wants to be a leader
   he should migrate to a non-Muslim country.
   Abu Musa, Malaysia

   Personally, sympathy to him. then again, if he was the victim of
   politically-motivated prosecution, wasn't he (an important)part of the
   government that makes all this abuse of power possible in the first
   place? The winners might be Anwar and the Abdullah government, but the
   losers are certainly ordinary Malaysians and that is the saddest part
   of this entire episode.
   Minghock, Malaysia

   I am an local university student. Like all common fellow Malaysian I
   hope and wish Anwar have a successful treatment in Munich. But one
   thing I don't want to see is another violent protest, I am just sick
   and tired of it. Hopefully his overzealous supporters wouldn't disrupt
   peace again. We Malaysian are getting rich everyday and positive about
   being the next Singapore. I just want peace and money, that's all!
   Wong Wen Thein, Kuching, Sarawak

   What this event crucially signifies is that there is still sense in the
   Malaysian judiciary system amidst the vile and sickening drama of
   Anwar's trial and the way he was treated while in prison. Democracy in
   Malaysia has moved a step forward and I believe we could all expect
   great things to come in the future, for a start being increased
   confidence in Malaysian democracy. I'd have to say Pak Lah is a true
   gentleman. God bless you, Mr Anwar.
   Rizal Hardi, Petaling Jaya, Selangor

   At last. It exposes the arrogance of the previous government and allows
   Malaysia to move forward. The country owes Anwar compensation, both
   moral and monetary.
   Raul Alexander, Berlin, Germany

   One more step towards true democracy for everyone in Asia

   Josephine Ong, London

   The judgement today vindicates all those who believed that the charges
   against Anwar were trumped up to remove him from challenging Dr
   Mahathir in 1997/78. Anwar is no angel but even if an angel there is
   always a little of the devil in one. The past six years must have given
   him plenty of time for to reflect on who are his supporters, who are
   his friends and his enemies. It should also have provided plenty of
   time for he to know what is right for this nation. He should now spend
   a little more time to ponder on what he has learned during these six
   long years of midnights now that he is in daylight once again. Maybe
   then should he plan his next move(s) and may those moves be right ones
   for him and the nation he says he so loves.
   Lone, Taiping, Malaysia

   One more step towards true democracy for everyone in Asia. Hurray for
   Anwar!
   Josephine Ong, London

   It is never too late for justice to be served. This thorn in the side
   of the government has been removed and it is time to concentrate on the
   healing process. Anwar should be as magnanimous as Mandela was when the
   latter was freed.
   William Lim, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   Welcome back Anwar Ibrahim. We Malaysians looking forward for a leader
   who can bring forward all three major races in a single party. We
   Malaysians hope that your fire within you will stay as bright as it was
   for the last 6 years. We will be with you. Malaysia need a leader like
   you to realise one political party for all Malaysians.
   Chandrasegaran, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   Anwar's freedom means that Malaysia has cemented its commitment to
   democracy into the 21st century. The new government led by Mr Badawi
   has honoured the concept of separation of powers by not interfering
   with its judiciary body. Hats off to the judges and him for having the
   courage to lead! The future holds for a more transparent system of
   accountability. I hope Malaysians will stand strong and work together
   towards a better Malaysia, setting a good model for the rest of the
   Islamic world as there is already enough conflict and instability
   amongst nations.
   As for Mr. Anwar's political career, I hope his supporters will take
   this opportunity to encourage positive message of peace and stability
   and the ability of Malaysians to work together for the good of its
   people.
   Mezwyn Carter, Australia

   The freedom of Mr Anwar means the Malaysia judiciary is trying to be
   transparent and moving towards balance judgement, which not the case in
   many countries which includes the Western block and not forgetting the
   ICJ in Hague. About his political force, he might be relevant if Dr
   Mahathir were still in place now as the prime minister but since the
   'super clean' man Mr Badawi is currently in control there is no chance
   for Mr Anwar camp to make any issues. We wish Mr Anwar and his wife a
   new peaceful and harmonious chapter of life.
   Dr Vijanth, Melaka Malaysia

   Anwar's release could well shake the earth under Malaysian politics

   Kumar, Melbourne, Australia

   The despair that has for so long infected observers of Malaysian
   justice has now lifted. We hope that this unexpected turn of events
   heralds a resurgence of democracy and freedom in Malaysia under Prime
   Minister Abdullah Badawi. Far from being a spent force, Anwar's release
   could well shake the earth under Malaysian politics. It is to Badawi's
   credit that he has chosen to right the grievous wrong of his
   predecessor rather than just look after his own political future. By
   doing so, he has shown himself worthy of his office.
   Kumar, Melbourne, Australia

   In my opinion, Malaysian Government released Mr Anwar simply because
   the new government wants to put this shameful event behind them.
   Actually it is pretty obvious that the sodomy charge is totally
   fabricated and should have been dismissed long time ago. I think Mr
   Anwar is still a potent political force because of his charisma and
   well connection in the Malay society.
   K C Goh, KL, Malaysia

   Anwar Ibrahim is still a political force. I am currently at his
   residence and from the crowd here definitely he still has the support
   like he had before he was removed as the No. 2 man in Malaysia. With
   the current political leaders lacking in charisma and vision Anwar
   Ibrahim will be a welcome change to the political scenario of Malaysia.
   Welcome back Anwar, our prayers for your release has been answered!
   Alif Lazeer, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   Anwar is still a potent political force in the country. However he
   should be grateful to Pak Lah for without his leadership Anwar's
   release would not have been possible. With both good and bad experience
   behind him Anwar should see the harmony and unity within the nation is
   not destroyed. He should listen to only sensible political minds
   wanting to do good for sound nation building of this multi racial
   society. RR
   R Rama Chandran, P Jaya, Malaysia

   The decision is a testament to the clean, fair and impartial
   administration under our beloved Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah
   Badawi. This is a new chapter written in Malaysia's history and it will
   allow us to let go of the past. It has given us renewed confidence in
   our Prime Minister and strengthen our believes in his ability and
   integrity. This is not a victory for Anwar and his supporters but a
   victory for all Malaysians.
   Alex Tan, Kuantan, Malaysia

   I'm glad that he has been released but what use is he now? He's
   politically too weak to pose any threat to the Barisan National.
   Ryan Mcbride, Singapore

   Freedom of Anwar Ibrahim is in favour of Abdullah Ahmed the Prime
   Minister of Malaysia. He has won the hearts of common people,
   especially Malay community. Many people became opponents of the
   government because of Anwar's issue and the government has now got good
   support of people for freeing him. Due to balanced policies on
   liberalism and Islam and having Islamic background Abdullah Ahmed is
   getting more support in majority race of Malay then his predecessor
   Ghulam Rasool, Malaysia, Cyberjaya

   Malaysians simply do not have a political dialogue that is in any way
   useful

   Matthew Malpeli, Kuala Lumpur

   As an ex-pat living in Kuala Lumpur, I have had much opportunity to
   gauge the attitudes of Malaysians towards Anwar, but with little
   results. Malaysians simply do not have a political dialogue that is in
   any way useful. What is clear is that the ruling UMNO party will always
   run the show and anyone who threatens their power will be ruthlessly
   silenced. All Malaysians should be worried... if they can do this to a
   former deputy prime minister, what's to stop them doing it to any
   citizen, for any reason they choose? They must end the division of
   political power based on race and have at least some ideological
   debate, or continue to suffer money politics and racial divide.
   Matthew Malpeli, Kuala Lumpur

   Thank God that now the world won't be laughing at our judiciary system
   anymore.
   George, Penang, Malaysia

   His power may have reduced. Otherwise he would not have been freed. We
   all know that he was jailed in a 100% political court ordered by
   Mahathir. It was a disgusting show to follow then. Getting Anwar free
   is a step of the Malaysian ruling party towards democracy but there is
   still a marathon ahead for real democracy. Democracy does not thrive in
   South East Asia.
   Miklos Nomad, Gyor, Hungary

   The former Malaysian prime minister has already got his pound of flesh
   from Anwar Ibrahim - they had already wrongfully imprisoned him under
   atrocious conditions for the last six years. It makes one wonder why so
   many former British colonies have dismal record when it comes to
   administering justice? Or are they simply following their rulers?
   Serbiach, Orange, CA, USA

   Thanks to all who pressured the Malaysian government to get Ibrahim out
   of jail.
   Joanna Sheldon, Ceret, France (expat USA)

   he has shown himself worthy of his office.
   Kumar, Melbourne, Australia

   Mr Anwar still exist in Malaysians' hearts and once out free, may
   command and become a powerful political figure in the country, if he
   wishes.
   Nazarene Nickolas, Selangor, Malaysia

   Malaysia has to become more of a level playing field for all races, to
   meet the challenges of the global economy, growth of China etc. He
   could do what no one else has been able to do, that is unite the
   fragmented opposition, and provide a credible opposition to the
   government. I think Abdullah Badawi knows he has to reform the system,
   reduce corruption and the free ride for some Malays, but he cannot move
   too fast, although his position has been strengthened by recent
   election results. I think Anwar can be an influence for the good in
   Malaysian politics, I doubt whether he will come to power in his own
   right. But no doubt this is a great day for all Malaysians.
   Mike, Bristol, UK

   Dr Vijanth, Melaka Malaysia

   The release of Anwar Ibrahim is a considerable morale and political
   booster towards the alternative front. Until now, the alternative front
   lacked a real leading character in its drive against the National
   Front. I could not help but show my delight, in a sense that there is
   hope that Anwar Ibrahim will be the next prime minister.
   Amir Hamiduddin Amha, Yokohama, Japan

   Anwar Ibrahim is still a political force. I am currently at his
   residence and from the crowd here definitely he still has the support
   like he had before he was removed as the Number Two man in Malaysia.
   With the current political leaders lacking in charisma and vision Anwar
   Ibrahim will be a welcome change to the political scenario of Malaysia.
   Welcome back Anwar, our prayers for your release have been answered!
   Alif Lazeer, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

   I think this is a brilliant move by Badawi. The Barisan party is on a
   popularity high at the moment what with winning all those seats away
   from PAS in Terengganu and Kelantan. Anwar's platform against the
   government has always been about corruption, Badawi's movement to stamp
   out corruption, although ineffective, basically nullifies Anwar's
   stand.
   Anne, Colchester, UK

   Thanks to God Almighty, freedom and justice has finally prevailed in my
   beloved country. I believe he will find his way easily into the
   country's political arena soon with his own state man and friend now
   being the new PM of this country. May God bless them for the future of
   this nation.

   US sailors charged over Iraq abuse

   A US military intelligence officer leads an Iraqi prisoner at Abu
   Ghraib
   Seven military reservists have already been charged

   Four members of one of the US Navy's elite units have been charged with
   abusing prisoners in Iraq, one of whom later died in Abu Ghraib prison.

   The four men, who are members of a Sea-Air-Land unit, known as Navy
   Seals, have not been identified.

   Naval official Commander Jeffrey Bender said more sailors might be also
   charged after an investigation into the death of another Iraqi
   detainee.

   These are the first charges of prisoner abuse to be made against the US
   Navy.

   Seven US Army reservists have been charged with the abuse of inmates at
   Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.

   Military investigators also have recommended charges against dozens of
   others in the army.

   At least 100 dead in China floods

   Aftermath of flooding in Chongqing, 5 September 2004
   The huge city of Chongqing has been badly disrupted

   At least 100 people have died in China as a result of heavy rains which
   have also put the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric system on flood
   alert.

   More than 80 other people are missing in south-western Sichuan province
   after days of rain which local officials described as the heaviest in
   years.

   Landslides and flash floods have destroyed houses and crops and left
   hundreds stranded.

   The heavy rain eased on Tuesday, as rescue teams tried to reach
   survivors.

   China regularly suffers storms and severe flooding in its summer rainy
   season, and more than 800 people have died due to severe weather this
   year.

   More than 450,000 people have been evacuated and 127,000 homes
   destroyed or damaged, the China Daily reported.

   In Sichuan and nearby Chongqing, entire communities have been marooned.

   The worst-affected area is said to be the city of Dazhou, which has
   been hit with 360mm (14.4 inches) of rain, and has lost all its road
   links.

   "There have been a lot of heavy mudslides and landslides. It is a
   serious situation in some counties," an official surnamed Liu at the
   Sichuan disaster relief bureau told the French news agency AFP.

   "In Dazhou city there are around 3,000 people trapped by mudslides. In
   that city around 10,000 are trapped altogether. Local officials and
   troops are trying to evacuate people in dangerous places," he said.

   The Chinese authorities put an initial estimate of the cost of flood
   damage in the region at hundreds of millions of dollars.

   To the east of Sichuan, the massive Three Gorges dam project was closed
   to shipping for the first time since it began operations earlier this
   year.

   Water flow at the dam has surpassed the warning levels of 45,000 cubic
   metres per second and is expected to reach 60,000 cubic metres per
   second on Wednesday, Xinhua said.

   Kerry, Bush clash over Iraq war

   John Kerry campaigns in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania
   Kerry accused Bush of rushing to war

   US Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and President George W
   Bush have used the traditional Labor Day holiday to step up their
   campaigning.

   During a blitz tour of key battleground states, Mr Kerry said the
   president's Iraq invasion was the "wrong war in the wrong place at the
   wrong time".

   Mr Bush accused his rival of repeatedly changing his mind about Iraq.

   The heated exchange came after two polls gave Mr Bush an 11-point lead
   ahead of the November election.

   Time magazine's poll on Friday had Mr Bush ahead 52-41 while Saturday's
   Newsweek poll had Mr Bush ahead by 54-43, both with a 4% error margin.

   CAMPAIGN PHOTOCALL

   BBC News Online wants your photos from the campaign trail

   Send us your pictures

   A rise in the opinion polls was expected after the high profile of the
   Republican Party's convention in New York, analysts say.

   The Kerry camp said the "Bush bounce" after the meeting would be
   temporary, but some senior Democrat leaders called for a change in his
   strategy.

   They argue that Mr Kerry has concentrated too much on national security
   - where President Bush has strong ratings - and not the social issues
   that are traditional democratic strengths, the BBC's Dan Griffiths in
   Washington says.

   'W for wrong choices'

   At a campaign stop in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, Mr Kerry told voters he
   would try to pull US troops out of Iraq within four years.

   "We want those troops home, and my goal would be to try to get them
   home in my first term," Mr Kerry said.

   At a later campaign stop in Racine, West Virginia, he launched a
   stinging attack on Mr Bush's record on a number of issues.

   No matter how many times Senator Kerry changes his mind, it was right
   for America and it's right for America now that Saddam Hussein is no
   longer in power

   US President George W Bush

   "It all comes down to one letter - W. George W Bush. And the W stand
   for wrong," the Massachusetts senator said.

   "The W stands for wrong choices, wrong judgement, wrong priorities,
   wrong direction for our country."

   He also accused Mr Bush of rushing to war without a plan, calling the
   president's coalition of allies in Iraq "the phoniest thing I ever
   heard".

   "It's the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time," Mr Kerry
   said.

   Under pressure from some Democrats to change the subject of his
   campaigning from national security, Mr Kerry also criticised Mr Bush's
   record on the economy and other domestic issues.

   Mr Kerry's last stop on his Labor Day whirlwind tour was a picnic in
   Ohio - another battleground states where polls show the presidential
   race is virtually tied.

   'Right' move

   Rebuking the attack, Mr Bush said in a speech prepared for supporters
   in Missouri that Mr Kerry was a politician who could not decide what he
   thought and stick to it.

   "After voting for the war, but against funding it, after saying he
   would have voted for the war even knowing everything we know today, my
   opponent woke up this morning with new campaign advisers and yet
   another new position," Mr Bush said in prepared remarks released by his
   camp.

   "Suddenly he's against it again. No matter how many times Senator Kerry
   changes his mind, it was right for America and it's right for America

   Nineteen die in Turkey mine fire

   Rescued miner
   Some of the trapped miners have been rescued

   At least 19 workers died and 17 were injured when a fire broke out in a
   copper mine in north-western Turkey.

   The blaze and subsequent explosion collapsed the entrance to the mine
   near the town of Kure, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Ankara.

   Thick smoke from the fire hampered rescue efforts as the men moved
   deeper into the mine seek refuge in shafts.

   The bodies and injured have been recovered but the mine was still being
   searched to make sure no-one was left.

   The fire is thought to have started during welding work in the tunnel,
   150m below the surface.

   It was extinguished after four hours and rescuers used gas masks to
   search in the thick smoke. Fans were used to dissolve the smoke and air
   was pumped into the mine.

   The workers who have already reached the surface were relieved to be
   free.

   "I spent three terrifying hours underground. I can't express how happy
   I am to be alive," miner Ali Cinar told Anatolian news agency.

   After news of the fire broke, officials on the surface were in contact
   with the trapped miners by radio and had said they were doing well.

   The BBC's Jonny Dymond said serious questions would asked about the
   incident as at first it seemed that many more of the men would have
   been saved.

   Iran defends nuclear programme

   A general view of Iran's first nuclear reactor, being built in Bushehr
   Critics ask why fuel-rich Iran wants nuclear energy too

   Iran has rejected a European bid to make it abandon its controversial
   nuclear activities but insists it is not pursuing atomic weapons.

   Germany, France and the UK have drawn up a deadline of November for
   Iran to abandon all parts of the atomic fuel cycle, particularly
   uranium enrichment.

   The proposal is due to be raised at a meeting of the United Nations'
   nuclear watchdog in Vienna on Monday.

   The Iranian foreign ministry said the idea was "out of the question".

   "If the Europeans and the international community want assurances that
   nuclear technology will be for peaceful purposes, we are ready to give
   assurances," ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters in
   Tehran.

   "But if the issue is that we cannot master nuclear technology for
   peaceful purposes, that is out of the question because we have already
   reached that point."

   November decision

   The European trio due to submit its draft resolution to the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has already been involved in
   delicate negotiations to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear
   ambitions.

   The United States has led concern that the Islamic Republic is
   developing a nuclear industry which could be used to build weapons.

   Iran has bought most of its nuclear technology from Russia.

   The draft resolution gives Iran until November to dispel doubts over
   its programme, at which stage the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei,
   would decide what further action is needed, if any.

   The US has asked for the issue to go to the UN Security Council which
   has the power to impose sanctions or worse.

   Post-match reaction

   Australia romped to a nine-wicket victory over USA after bowling the
   minnows out for just 65 at a chilly Rose Bowl.

   Jason Gillespie and Mike Kasprowicz claimed four wickets each to
   dismiss the Americans for the lowest total in ICC Champions Trophy
   history.

   With star batsman Clayton Lambert nursing a groin injury, only Steve
   Massiah (23) reached double figures.

   And it took just 7.5 overs for the world champions to complete the win,
   despite losing Matthew Hayden for 23.

   Ricky Ponting joined Adam Gilchrist in stand of 25 after Hayden edged
   Howard Johnson behind while trying to heave the medium-pacer over long
   off.

   Gilchrist survived on 13, when Tony Reid dropped a return catch, and
   smashed Rashid Zia for the first six of the match to finish proceedings
   unbeaten on 24.

   So one-sided was the contest that a crowd estimated at 1,000-strong was
   heading home by 1.30pm.

   Australia had declared their intent before the match by including four
   pace bowlers in their side, with veteran Glenn McGrath replacing
   all-rounder Shane Watson.

   And despite a half-hour delay because of overnight rain the course of
   the match proved predictable after Ponting won the toss and elected to
   bowl first.

   A complete an utter waste of time! £25 for three hours of meaningless
   cricket - and the ICC wonder why this hasn't taken off?
   From PA
   Have your say on TMS

   It took Brett Lee two balls to start the demolition as Mark Johnson
   lost his leg stump when he shuffled too far across in front of his
   stumps.

   The second over brought another wicket as Damien Martyn swooped from
   cover with a direct hit to remove Leon Romero, who had already been
   dropped at slip.

   Massiah made a defiant start, hooking McGrath over midwicket and
   straight-driving the fiery Lee but that third-wicket stand of 30 was
   the only time Australia were frustrated.

   Kasprowicz replaced Lee at the Pavilion End, having Rohan Alexander
   caught behind with his second ball and dismissing Richard Staple with a
   lucky lbw decision.

   Feature: Minnows leave Australia cold

   Massiah - the only batsman who could deal with the pace - declined to
   stick around and his attempt to go over the top for the second time
   brought a steepling catch for mid-off.

   Reid went lbw to the very next delivery and at that point Kasprowicz
   had figures of 4-6 from 16 balls, which became 4-14 from seven overs.

   Aijaz Ali avoided hat-trick but was the first of Gillespie's four
   wickets in as many overs, caught behind off a thin edge.

   His 4-15 ranked as the fifth-best analysis ever in this tournament,
   just below his team-mate.

   Three held after attack on Karzai

   President Hamid Karzai
   President Karzai reportedly wanted to continue his visit

   Afghan authorities have arrested three people following an attempt to
   shoot down President Hamid Karzai's helicopter on Thursday.

   The three suspects were detained about 10km (six miles) from the scene
   of the attack near Gardez, in south-eastern Paktia province, officials
   said.

   A rocket was fired but missed, causing no casualties.

   President Karzai was making his first trip outside Kabul to support his
   bid for the presidency in 9 October polls.

   Taleban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election process.

   President Karzai immediately abandoned his trip.

   Kandahar attack

   Interior ministry spokesman Lutfullah Mashal said the men were detained
   in the centre of Gardez after they tried to escape on motorcycles.

   Police also found detonators and explosives, Mr Mashal said.

   "They admitted during questioning that they carried out the attack," he
   said.

   "They had documents and tools related to the rocket attack and were
   arrested by police with the help of villagers."

   Paktia governor Haji Assadullah Wafa said: "It's not written on their
   foreheads that they are [Taleban] but their beards and clothes are like
   [Taleban]."

   The US military confirmed a rocket was fired at the president's
   helicopter as it tried to land.

   "The rocket missed the helicopter and impacted approximately 300 metres
   away from a school near the landing zone," the US military said in a
   statement.

   "The aircraft did not land and flew immediately back to Kabul. The
   president was not in any imminent danger."

   The president was reportedly critical of the US military for not
   allowing him to continue to Gardez.

   The attack was the most serious attempt on his life since an attack on
   his convoy in the southern city of Kandahar two years ago.

   President Karzai has rarely been seen outside his heavily-fortified
   presidential compound since then.

   The BBC's Andrew North in Kabul says that Paktia province has been an
   area of frequent attacks by suspected Taleban militants.

   Critics say the president has little control of events beyond Kabul.

   France says hostages still alive

   Still from video shown on al-Jazeera TV The Frenchmen have been shown
   in a video pleading for their release

   Two French journalists taken hostage in Iraq are believed to be alive
   and safe, France's defence minister has said.

   But Sunni Muslim clerics in Iraq say efforts to free them are being
   hampered by the escalation of security operations led by US forces.

   Australia is investigating whether a body found north of Baghdad is
   that of one of its citizens.

   There has been no news on the fate of a Briton and two US nationals
   abducted from a house in Baghdad on Thursday.

   The three were seized at gunpoint by a gang who raided the house in the
   capital's Mansour neighbourhood.

   The US embassy in Iraq named the two Americans as Jack Hensley and
   Eugene Armstrong.

   The British embassy did not release details of the Briton but Foreign
   Secretary Jack Straw has contacted the man's family to reassure them
   the UK is doing everything it can for him, his department said on
   Friday.

   'Alive and well'

   French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said she had new
   information on the fate of journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges
   Malbrunot, who disappeared in Iraq nearly a month ago.

   KIDNAP FACTS

   Simona Pari (left) and Simona Torretta

   More than 100 foreigners seized (including two Italian aid workers,
   pictured)
   19 being held
   25 killed, including (12 Nepalese)
   At least 3 Americans seized: Nick Berg - civilian - beheaded; Keith
   Maupin - soldier - killed (unconfirmed); Thomas Hamill -civilian -
   escaped
   One Briton kidnapped: James Brandon - journalist - released

   Hostage facts
   Iraq's hostage-takers

   "We have information that allows us to think - without having direct
   proof - that our hostages are alive, safe and in good health," she told
   Le Parisien newspaper.

   "All the relevant ministries, including defence, of course, are
   permanently mobilised," she added.

   The Committee of the Ulema, Iraq's top Sunni religious organisation
   also suggested the pair were still alive but said attempts to free them
   were being frustrated.

   "We are under the impression that the American forces do not want the
   hostages to be freed because each time we get near a solution, these
   forces push for a military escalation," said Mohammed Ayash al-Kubaisi,
   the group's representative abroad.

   "We believe these forces have political aims, seeking to create a
   chaotic situation which does not contribute to progress," he told AFP
   news agency in Qatar.

   Body found

   Early on Friday, the body of a man said to have western features was
   pulled from the River Tigris near the central Iraqi village of Yethrib.

   A spokesman for Australia's foreign minister said they were trying to
   determine if the victim was one of two Australian security guards whom
   militants claim to have taken hostage.

   The latest kidnappings bring the number currently being held to 19.

   Two female Italian aid workers were taken last week.

   The kidnapping of Iraqis for ransom has become commonplace,
   particularly in Baghdad, but such abductions go virtually unreported by
   the international media.

   Swimmers boost medal tally

   Athens diary: 19 Sept
   Photos: Second day action
   Full schedule of events

   Great Britain kept up the gold rush on day two of the Paralympic Games
   with double success in the swimming pool.

   Sascha Kindred overpowered the field to defend his 200m individual
   medley title while Natalie Jones took a surprise gold in the women's
   event.

   Earlier, Isabel Newstead retained her air pistol title to win her ninth
   Paralympic gold medal.

   In athletics, fellow nine-time Paralympic gold medallist Tanni Grey
   Thompson reached Monday's 800m final.

   But there was disappointment for defending T11 10,000m Bob Matthews,
   who struggled to cope with the pace in a high quality field.

   The 43-year-old finished back in fifth place and will now focus on the
   5,000m on Friday.

   Sally Reddin, the oldest member of Team GB, also failed to defend her
   F54 shot putt title.

   Veteran athletes miss out

   Her best throw of 5.96 was only good enough for fifth place.

   At the Olympic Aquatics centre, 17-year-old Rhiannon Henry set Britain
   on their way with bronze in the S13 women's 100m butterfly.

   Kindred leads medal haul

   Kindred turned up the heat, destroying the field in the second half of
   the men's 200m individual medley, to win in a new Paralympic record
   time of 2:51.39.

   Jones made it double gold in the pool as she held off team-mate Nyree
   Lewis to take the women's SM6 200m individual medley in a world record
   time of 3:18.68.

   Welshman Dave Roberts took silver in the SM7 200m individual medley -
   just six months after taking up the event.

   Fran Williamson took bronze in the women's 100m S3 freestyle while
   Anthony Stephens came third in the S5 100m freestyle.

   Giles Long, who qualified third fastest, missed out on a third straight
   S8 100m butterfly crown and had to settle for bronze.

   Newstead started another outstanding day for Britain by clinching gold
   in the SH1 air pistol by the narrowest of margins.

   The Scot notched up a winning total of 466.8 to edge out Chinese
   Taipei's Chin Mei Lin by just 1.7 points.

   Newstead defends title

   In the track cycling, Britons Ian Sharpe and sighted pilot Paul Hunter
   beat Spain's Christian Venge and David Llaurado in the contest for the
   men's B1-3 tandem 4km individual pursuit bronze medal.

   Darren Kenny also guaranteed himself at least a silver medal to add to
   his gold in the 1km time trial.

   Kenny secured his place in a head-to-head battle against Spain's Javier
   Otxoa for the gold medal in the 3km individual pursuit on Monday.

   Brits win rugby opener

   In wheelchair rugby, reigning European wheelchair rugby champions Great
   Britain got their campaign off to a winning start against Belgium with
   a 27-22 victory in Group B.

   They will next face Canada and Germany, two of the competition's
   strongest teams.

   GB women battle to victory

   And it was good news for the women's basketball with Team GB claiming a
   36-30 win against the Holland in their opening game.

   But their male counterparts crashed 80-59 to Australia to sink to their
   second straight defeat in Athens.

   Judo blow for Jackson

   Simon Jackson, who won gold medals and a bronze at four previous Games,
   made a sit-down protest against a referee decision after being beaten
   in his preliminary under-73kg judo bout by Ukrainian Sergiy Sydorenko.

   There was also disappointment for Maxine Ingram, Britain's first female
   judo player to reach the Paralympics.

   Britain's John Robertson, Hannah Stodel and Stephen Thomas in action in
   the Sonar It was another mixed day on the water for Britain's Sonar
   team

   She finished fifth in the women's under-73kg category after losing to
   eventual silver medallist Germany's Silke Huetter.

   David Gardener got his debut at the Games off to a good start as he
   reached the second round of the men's singles as the tennis event got
   under way.

   British number one Jayant Mistry and Kevin Plowman also advanced.

   But London's Simon Hatt lost out to Hungary's Laszlo Farkas in the
   opening round and will now focus on the doubles.

   After a bright start on Saturday, Briton Catherine Mitton lost her
   second preliminary table tennis match to Genevieve Clot of France.

   Out on the water, Britain's Allan Smith climbed to eighth place overall
   in the 2.4mR individual sailing event after four races.

   In the Sonar, John Robertson, Hannah Stodel and Stephen Thomas lie in
   10th place after another mixed day's sailing.

   The trio were ninth in race three but were then disqualified from the
   fourth race for crossing the start line too early.

   Singh and Bush praise close ties

   Manmohan Singh (left) and George Bush
   Mr Singh praised the president's leadership

   Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has met US President George W Bush
   in New York on the second leg of his eight-day foreign tour.

   South Asian peace moves and boosting bilateral ties were among the main
   topics of a meeting described as "very warm, friendly and relaxed".

   Mr Singh is in the US to attend the UN General Assembly, on his first
   major diplomatic trip since taking office.

   He and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf are to meet on Friday.

   Our countries' relations have grown in diverse ways but I do believe
   the best is yet to come

   Indian PM Manmohan Singh

   Key talks to spur India-US ties

   The two South Asian leaders are among about 100 heads of state and
   government attending the General Assembly.

   Mr Singh kicked off his foreign trip in London, where British Prime
   Minister Tony Blair gave his backing to India's efforts to win a
   permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

   Kashmir denial

   Posing for the cameras with Mr Bush before they had their meeting, Mr
   Singh praised his host's "distinguished leadership".

   There is no question of any territorial concession being offered by
   India to Pakistan

   Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna

   "Our countries' relations have grown in diverse ways but I do believe
   the best is yet to come," he told reporters.

   Mr Singh said he wanted progress on economic and high-technology issues
   with the US - last Friday Washington agreed to lift export controls on
   equipment for nuclear facilities in India after receiving
   non-proliferation assurances.

   The talks in New York came as India denied it would make territorial
   concessions in the disputed Kashmir region to Pakistan.

   A foreign weekly had reported that India was willing to "adjust" the
   Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries, in
   Kashmir "by a matter of miles".

   "This is completely and wholly inaccurate. Any suggestion that the
   prime minister will make such an offer [to Pakistan] is factually
   wrong," Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna told Reuters.

   "There is no question of any territorial concession being offered by
   India to Pakistan."

   'Sluggish'

   Friday's meeting between the Indian and Pakistani leaders will be their
   first since Mr Singh became prime minister in May.

   Pakistan hopes the talks will push forward a peace process which began
   at the start of the year but which its foreign ministry spokesman
   described on Monday as "sluggish".

   Manmohan Singh and Tony Blair
   Mr Singh's meeting with President Bush is a major diplomatic foray

   Mr Singh promised in his talks in London that he would engage
   constructively with Pakistan over the Kashmir dispute, provided the
   threat caused by Kashmiri separatists could be kept under control.

   President Musharraf has said he is looking forward to meeting Mr Singh
   and "dealing with all issues, very much including Kashmir".

   Despite some improvement in trade and transport ties, the dialogue has
   done little to ease tensions over Kashmir, the spark for two wars
   between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

   India accuses Pakistan of sponsoring an Islamic uprising in its part of
   Kashmir. Pakistan says it only lends diplomatic backing to an
   indigenous insurgency against Indian rule.

   Haiti appeals for aid after storm

   People sit in rubble next to cars destroyed and debris in Gonaives,
   Haiti
   Floods devastated Haiti's northwest

   Haiti's president has appealed for aid to help the island in the
   aftermath of tropical storm Jeanne whose floods have claimed nearly 700
   lives.

   Boniface Alexandre told a meeting of the United Nations General
   Assembly in New York that the storm had left a humanitarian disaster in
   its wake.

   Large swathes of the northwest of the country remain submerged and some
   1,000 people are still missing.

   The northern port city of Gonaives was the worst-hit by rising
   floodwaters.

   We are going to start burying people in mass graves

   Toussaint Kongo-Doudou
   UN spokesman

   In pictures: Haiti floods

   Haiti's interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue told the BBC that more
   than 80,000 people in the northwest of the Caribbean country had
   absolutely nothing to eat.

   UN peacekeeping troops - sent after the overthrow of President
   Jean-Bertrand Aristide - are already working with aid agencies to help
   the victims of the storm.

   Haiti - the poorest country in the Western hemisphere - is particularly
   vulnerable to tropical storms, correspondents say.

   Heavy deforestation has left few trees to hold back water and low lying
   areas have no protection from heavy rains.

   Rising toll

   "In the face of this tragedy, which is of the magnitude of a
   humanitarian disaster, I appeal urgently for the solidarity of the
   international community," Mr Alexandre said.

   Officials said some 600 bodies had been retrieved in Gonaives alone and
   around 100 bodies elsewhere.

   "We are going to start burying people in mass graves later Tuesday," UN
   spokesman Toussaint Kongo-Doudou said.

   Aid workers warned the number of dead was likely to increase as the
   waters subsided.

   "I'm afraid those figures are going to increase, as there are areas
   that still remain inaccessible," Hans Havik of the International
   Federation of Red Cross Societies told Agence France Press.

   Residents forced to take shelter on rooftops reported bloated bodies
   floating along the flooded streets of Gonaives.

   Days of torrential rain have sparked mudslides, isolating communities
   as roads were destroyed and homes swept away by the water.

   "The river destroyed my house completely and now we have nothing,"
   18-year-old Katya Silme told the Associated Press news agency, adding
   she and her family spent the night in a tree.

   'Vast sea'

   Initial reports suggested the island of La Tortue, off the northern
   coast of Haiti, had been completely submerged by the rising water
   levels.

   Mr Latortue earlier described the flooded area as "a vast sea" and
   declared three days of national mourning.

   The UN World Food Programme (WFP) estimates 175,000 people are without
   food, water and electricity and in need of help.

   "The floodwaters were so strong in Gonaives that they have washed away
   the whole town," WFP Country Director Guy Gauvreau told BBC News
   Online.

   "People don't have the means to cook, and they lack water."

   "We could have had an earthquake or a civil war but this is worse
   because it has washed everything away," he said.

   In the past year Haiti has faced a series of crises including armed
   revolts, military intervention and deadly floods.

   Aid difficult

   Aid efforts led by international agencies are under way, assisted by
   3,000 UN peacekeeping troops already in the country.

   But severed road links and a tense security situation are hampering
   efforts.

   The WFP said aid trucks carrying emergency food supplies had been lined
   up to form a makeshift bridge over the water.

   The International Red Cross said it was considering the use of boats to
   reach trapped people.

   The EU announced it would send 1.5m euros ($1.8m) in urgent aid, and
   the US Embassy offered $60,000 in immediate relief.

   say nothing happened there.
   2. About 30% of Port-de-Paix city is reported to be covered by water
   along the coast and nearby plantations are reported to be under water.
   The road to Gonaives is flooded.
   3. The water level of the river is reported to be very high and some
   villages on its banks have been flooded.
   4. Flooding has hit all urban areas of Gonaives, affecting about
   175,000 people - some 600 people are believed to have died there.

   Scorpion woman ends record stunt

   Nur Malena Hassan
   Hassan spent more than a month with deadly roommates

   A Malaysian woman has emerged from a room full of scorpions after
   claiming a record for living 36 days with the deadly creatures.

   Nur Malena Hassan, 27, stepped out of the enclosure in the eastern
   Malaysian city of Kuantan, cheered by supporters.

   She told reporters she had got what she wanted after being stung 17
   times.

   For more than a month Ms Hassan, nicknamed the Scorpion Queen, had
   shared a glass box in a shopping mall with 3,069 poisonous arachnids.

   After ending her stunt on Saturday, she said she could not wait to get
   back to regular activities - like shopping.

   "My mum is here and we're at a mall, so I'm starting right away," the
   Associated Press news agency quoted her as saying.

   I got what I wanted after enduring pain from 17 stings and spending 36
   days in there

   Nur Malena Hassan

   A spokeswoman for the Malaysia Book of Records said a video and other
   documentation would be sent to the Guinness Book of World Records in
   London.

   Thousands of people visited the mall to observe the attempt, as Ms
   Hassan slept, ate, read magazines and watched television amid the
   scorpions.

   She made no sudden movement, to avoid getting stung.

   Second record

   After five years of training, Ms Hassan has built up resistance to
   scorpion stings - but she can still faint if stung three times in quick
   succession.

   A doctor was on standby to treat her if necessary.

   This is not Ms Hassan's first stunt.

   She first broke the world record in 2001, after spending 30 days in a
   box with 2,700 scorpions.

   But a year later she was outdone by Kanchana Ketkeaw of Thailand, who
   lived for 31 days with 3,400 animals.

   Snot flies in Taiwan-Singapore row

   Pro-independence supporters march in Taiwan
   Singapore is alarmed by the rise of independence forces in Taiwan

   Taiwan's foreign minister has sparked a diplomatic row by calling
   Singapore "the size of a piece of snot".

   Chen Tan-sun was angry over comments made by Singapore's foreign
   minister, George Yeo, who recently said Taiwan should not press for
   independence.

   Mr Chen said: "Even Singapore, a country the size of a piece of snot,
   can swagger around to criticise Taiwan at the United Nations".

   He said Mr Yeo only made the comments to please Taiwan's rival, China.

   "It was nothing but an effort to embrace China's 'balls', forgive me
   using such a word," Mr Chen told supporters on Monday.

   Relations between Taiwan and Singapore have been strained since
   Singapore's new prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, used a national
   address in August to say he was alarmed at the build-up in
   pro-independence forces inside Taiwan.

   China views Taiwan as part of its territory, and has threatened to
   invade if it ever formally declares independence.

   Mr Yeo used a speech to the UN's General Assembly to warn about the
   risks of China-Taiwan tensions.

   "The push towards independence by certain groups in Taiwan is the most
   dangerous, because it will lead to war with mainland China and drag in
   other countries," he said.

   Syria 'to seal' border with Iraq

   Iraqi women walk towards the passport office at the Iraqi border with
   Syria in al-Waleed
   The US wants something done about the porous Syria-Iraq border

   The US says Syria has agreed to tighten its border with Iraq to prevent
   militants from crossing the border.

   The move followed two days of talks in Damascus between Syrian and
   Iraqi officials and US military commanders, US State Department
   officials said.

   There has been no word yet from the Syrian government.

   The US has long pressed Damascus to crack down on what it sees as
   terror groups and to prevent insurgents from moving in and out of
   Syria.

   Now what we have to see is action on the part of the Syrians

   US Secretary of State Colin Powell

   "A number of understandings have come out of this meeting with respects
   to commitment with the Iraqi interim government and the coalition and
   the Syrians to stop illicit activity across the border," US Secretary
   of State Colin Powell said in an interview with the AFP news agency.

   "I think it is a positive step, but what really matters is action and
   not just an agreement," Mr Powell said.

   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher described earlier on
   Wednesday the two-day Damascus talks as "constructive and positive".

   Mr Boucher declined to comment on "the specific details" of the deal.

   "But we do have fairly concrete understandings - particularly between
   the Iraqi government and the Syrian government on thing like
   communications,.. how they can deploy forces, how they can move
   together to cut off the border traffic," he said.

   The US seems to have achieved its aim of moving on from political
   promises to specific practical measures Syria has agreed to take, the
   BBC's State Department correspondent Jill McGivering reports.

   This follows directly from an apparent breakthrough last week at a
   meeting between Mr Powell and the Syrian foreign minister, our
   correspondent says.

   Washington may feel it has some real leverage at the moment on
   Damascus, which currently appears particularly isolated, with new UN
   pressure over its presence in Lebanon, analysts say.

   Italian hostages tell of ordeal

   Simona Pari, left, and Simona Torretta smile as they arrive at Rome's
   Ciampino military airport
   The women said they were taught about Islam

   The two Italian aid workers released by their captors in Iraq have said
   being together helped them through the worst of their ordeal.

   "Our serenity much depended on our being together," Simona Torretta
   said at a press conference on Thursday.

   She and Simona Pari were held for three weeks after being kidnapped
   from their offices in Baghdad.

   They returned home on Tuesday to a hero's welcome. There have been
   claims that a ransom secured their release.

   Italy has denied paying any money or negotiating with the
   hostage-takers.

   But a senior politician said that was only an "official" denial, and
   that he believed $1m changed hands.

   We have always tried to unite two very different worlds, and we hope
   that dialogue will continue

   Simona Pari

   Women's account
   Kidnappings: Have your say
   Tangible relief in Rome

   Italian Red Cross Commissioner Maurizio Scelli, who played a role in
   securing the women's release, emphatically denied that a ransom had
   been paid.

   The two women - aid workers for the humanitarian group Bridge to
   Baghdad - thanked everyone involved in their release, from "the
   government" to "Muslim and Christian communities in Italy and the
   world".

   Ms Torretta said they were treated "with dignity and respect" by their
   captors.

   "They brought us soap and books on Islam, made us read the Koran, and
   taught us the principles of Islam," she said.

   Ms Pari said: "We have always tried to unite two very different worlds,
   and we hope that dialogue will continue."

   'Iraqis still hostage'

   The pair said there were difficult times, particularly in the first few
   days after their capture.

   "Being together gave us a lot of strength and helped us to overcome the
   most difficult moments," Ms Torretta said.

   Fabio Alberti, the president of Bridge to Baghdad, said he hoped now
   his colleagues' ordeal was over, his organisation could get back to its
   work in Iraq.

   "Now we'd like to go back... to helping the Iraqi people, who in a way
   are still being held a hostage - of the war."

   Blast hits Thai fireworks factory

   Remains of factory
   The factory was reduced to rubble

   An explosion at a fireworks factory in central Thailand has killed at
   least 14 people and injured several others.

   It completely destroyed the factory in the city of Ayutthaya, about
   70km (44 miles) north of Bangkok, and damaged nearby houses.

   The cause of the blast is being investigated.

   Police and local government officials said the factory had lost its
   licence 10 years ago following an earlier explosion, and was operating
   illegally.

   The dead are said to include a four-year-old boy.

   Four teenagers with severe skin burns are reported to be being treated
   at a nearby hospital.

   Police said no-one outside the factory had been injured by the blast.

   Festival

   Police said they suspected the accident may have been the result of
   increased fireworks production at the factory to complete orders ahead
   of the kingdom's Loi Krathong festival.

   The festival falls on 26 November this year and is one of Thailand's
   largest festivals, celebrated by people all over the country.

   Police Lt Col Sawek Pasakdi said he witnessed the explosion.

   "There was a big noise and the ground was shaking. I saw a blazing fire
   and a cloud rising like a mushroom," he told Reuters news agency.

   Ayutthaya is Thailand's ancient capital.

   Date set for India Maoist talks

   PWG rally in July
   Show of strength: A PWG rally earlier this year

   A date has been announced for the first direct peace talks between
   Maoist rebels in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and the state
   government.

   The government says the talks will be held on 15 October.

   Correspondents say that for the first time in 25 years of fighting,
   leaders of the People's War Group (PWG) will come out of hiding to
   negotiate.

   Last week thousands of people rallied in support of the PWG and its
   allies in the state capital, Hyderabad.

   It was the first public rally by the PWG in Hyderabad for nearly 15
   years.

   It was joined by another rebel group, Janashakti.

   Wide agenda

   Just a year ago the PWG tried to assassinate then chief minister of the
   state, Chandrababu Naidu.

   The Maoists have been given an assurance of safe passage for the talks,
   which are to be held in Hyderabad.

   The rebels have a wide-ranging agenda, including land redistribution
   and tribal autonomy.

   Mr Naidu's successor in office, the Congress Party, lifted a ban on the
   Maoists and offered the peace talks.

   Andhra Pradesh is a stronghold of the PWG, but the group is active in
   six other states spread across northern, central and southern India.

   England 2-0 Wales
   Virtual Replay: 3D animation of Lampard's goal for England
   Virtual Replay: Watch Beckham seal victory against Wales

   Goalscorer Beckham celebrates with Owen

   England v Wales in photos

   David Beckham scored a spectacular goal to seal England a comfortable
   World Cup qualifying victory over Wales.

   England were ahead from their first attack as Frank Lampard's shot flew
   in off the heel of Michael Owen.

   And Beckham put the gloss on the tie when he curled a shot into the top
   right-hand corner of Paul Jones' goal.

   Jones was outstanding, producing fine stops from Owen, Wayne Rooney and
   Beckham, whose late booking rules him out of Wednesday's game in
   Azerbaijan.

   Otherwise, there was little to complain about for England coach
   Sven-Goran Eriksson, who was able to recall fit-again Rooney and Sol
   Campbell, as well as Rio Ferdinand following his eight-month ban for
   missing a drugs test.

   All three went straight back into the starting line-up, Campbell and
   Ferdinand effortlessly resurrecting their central defensive partnership
   for the first time in 20 internationals and at the expense of the
   unfortunate John Terry and Ledley King.

   Rooney was confirmed as a deep-lying striker behind the pacy
   partnership of Owen and Jermain Defoe.

   And, despite playing only twice this season after injury, the teenager
   ran the game from the off.

   Wales, whose preparations were rocked by an injury to Andy Melville
   during the warm-up, looked on edge every time Rooney got the ball and
   England's confident start was underlined by a goal inside four minutes.

   Nicky Butt's neat ball to the edge of the penalty area was laid off by
   Owen into the path of Lampard, whose shot clipped Owen's heel and flew
   past the helpless Jones.

   Rooney nearly made it 2-0 after 12 minutes when he eased past Mark
   Pembridge and sprinted towards goal, before unleashing a low drive that
   Jones pushed on to the post and behind.

   Vindication of Eriksson's decision to field three strikers was served
   midway through the first half when all three combined in a sweeping
   England move.

   Defoe's deft flick set Rooney free and he teed Owen up for a shot which
   produced an unorthodox save with his legs by the befuddled Jones.

   It wasn't pretty but we won and kept a clean sheet which is all that
   matters

   Have your say on 606

   At the other end, England keeper Paul Robinson was virtually redundant.

   He would have been relieved to see Gary Speed's clever flick, turn and
   volley sail over his crossbar from John Hartson's knock-down on 25
   minutes.

   And Wales captain Speed was again unfortunate not to test the keeper
   more when his diving header from a Ryan Giggs free-kick flew straight
   into Robinson's hands.

   But, despite enjoying spells of possession around the half-way line,
   Wales hardly threatened in the final third, while England looked
   menacing every time they attacked.

   Rooney could have eased the home side into the comfort zone 10 minutes
   into the second half as he burst into the penalty area after
   outmuscling Mark Delaney.

   But, with Owen and Defoe in space to his right, Rooney opted to shoot
   from a tight angle and produced a fine save from the alert Jones.

   The Wolves keeper also did well to read a Beckham chip after another
   patient England build-up had threatened a sublime goal for the captain.

   But Beckham was not to be denied his moment of glory and he sealed
   England's win with a superb strike 12 minutes from time.

   Butt again provided the pass, easily holding off Hartson's challenge
   and feeding Beckham for a chip beyond Jones and into the top right-hand
   corner.

   Beckham might have had another two minutes later, only to be denied by
   a superb point-blank save from Jones after Danny Gabbidon's mistake.

   Gabbidon blocked Rooney's goalbound follow-up and then denied the
   striker with a desperate last-ditch lunge after Rooney had breezed past
   three defenders.

   Beckham limped off injured in the closing stages, but not before a
   reckless challenge on Ben Thatcher that earned the England captain the
   booking that means he will be suspended for Wednesday's game against
   Azerbaijan.

   Cambodia rush to solve succession

   King Sihanouk No-one is sure how to choose King Sihanouk's successor

   Cambodian politicians will hold urgent talks on Friday to begin
   choosing a new monarch, after King Sihanouk announced he wanted to
   abdicate.

   A new king is chosen by a nine-member throne council, but the exact
   process has never been established since a new constitution took effect
   in 1993.

   The National Assembly first needs to pass a law to agree succession
   details.

   Prince Norodom Ranariddh is to fly to Beijing on Saturday to try and
   dissuade his father from stepping down.

   The king, 81, said on Thursday, that he wanted to retire due to old age
   and ill health.

   There was some doubt over whether King Sihanouk could abdicate, since
   the constitution only allows for a succession in the event of the
   monarch's death.

   TROUBLED SUCCESSION

   Laws for deciding succession still not agreed

   King thought to want Prince Sihamoni to succeed
   Eldest son Ranariddh says he does not want the post

   Succession riddle

   But correspondents say Prime Minister Hun Sen's government appears
   ready to overlook that and pass legislation on how the succession
   should be decided.

   Prince Ranariddh, however, is to try and persuade his father to stay
   on, arguing that neither himself nor his half-brother Norodom Sihamoni
   wants to succeed their father.

   Prince Ranariddh will meet the king in Beijing, where he has been
   receiving medical treatment.

   Prince Sihamoni is the leading candidate to become the next monarch. A
   classically trained dancer, he has worked in Paris for the United
   Nations cultural organisation, Unesco. More recently, he has been with
   his father in China.

   Prince Ranariddh said he hoped the country's assembly would pass a
   succession law on Friday.

   King Sihanouk has said he will not return to Cambodia until the Royal
   Throne Council has chosen a new monarch.

   Prince Ranariddh told Voice of America radio late on Thursday that the
   crisis could also stall key legislation passed by Cambodia's parliament
   earlier this week to allow a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders to go ahead
   as nobody would be able to sign it into law.

   Mercurial leader

   The king, 81, has abdicated before and threatened to quit again many
   times.

   In a letter read on state television late on Wednesday, the king asked
   that he be allowed to "retire" because of his fragile health, saying
   that doctors have detected a "new and serious ailment" in his stomach.

   But there is speculation that he has made the move to force the
   Cambodian authorities to hammer out the succession process.

   Norodom Sihanouk's reign has been as turbulent as his country's
   history, interrupted by civil war and the Killing Fields of the
   communist Khmer Rouge when more than 1m of his subjects were killed by
   starvation or execution.

   In recent years he has run his own outspoken website, commenting on
   Cambodia's endless political power struggles.

   Cambodia king confirms abdication

   King Sihanouk King Sihanouk's successor will be chosen by a nine-member
   council

   Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk has confirmed he is determined to
   abdicate.

   In a letter read on radio and TV and posted on his website, he said he
   was too ill to continue.

   His son, Prince Ranariddh, has travelled to Beijing, where the king is
   receiving medical treatment, to ask him to reconsider.

   In his first public comments on the abdication, PM Hun Sen said
   lawmakers must work "day and night to prevent the country becoming a
   republic".

   The prime minister said he had proposed King Sihanouk's other son,
   Norodom Sihamoni, to become the next king.

   The deadline for picking a new monarch was 14 October, Hun Sen said.

   Succession riddle
   Profile of King Sihanouk

   On Friday, Cambodia approved a law on how to choose a new monarch which
   the senate and constitutional council still have to pass and which
   allows a nine-member Throne Council to elect Sihanouk's heir.

   According to the new law, the council must meet within seven days to
   elect a successor if the king "dies, retires or abdicates".

   "The hope that the king will retake his post as the king appears to be
   lost," Hun Sen told reporters on his return from a summit of Asian and
   European leaders in Vietnam.

   Prince Ranariddh, who is also head of the national assembly, has said
   neither he nor his half-brother Prince Sihamoni want to take the throne
   in these circumstances.

   Prince Sihamoni is a classically trained dancer and has worked in Paris
   for the UN's cultural organisation, Unesco. More recently, he has been
   with his father in China.

   Shock

   The king's decision shocked Cambodia, not least because the
   constitution, rewritten in 1993, does not cover the issue of
   abdication.

   Most of the leading figures in Cambodian life have signed petitions
   asking the king to stay on.

   In some quarters, the abdication announcement was seen as a move to
   spur Cambodia's political leaders to draw up plans for a succession,
   correspondents say.

   The king, who turns 82 at the end of the month, has been receiving
   medical treatment in Beijing for several months for a "serious stomach
   complaint".

   He says he will not return to Cambodia until a new monarch has been
   chosen.

   Sharp CO2 rise divides opinions

   Rhewlif San Rafael (Prifysgol Cymru Aberystwyth)
   Many ice bodies from the poles to the tropics are in retreat

   Climate scientists are puzzled over the possible significance of rising
   levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).

   Some think a recent acceleration in CO2 increases could be a sign of
   imminent, rapid global warming.

   But others say the evidence of just two years is inconclusive, and
   suspect that natural causes are likelier culprits.

   The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, says the
   rise appears on the evidence so far to be an aberration, not the start
   of a trend.

   Carbon dioxide is the main gas given off by human activities (including
   the burning of fossil fuels, and deforestation) which scientists
   believe is exacerbating natural climate change.

   In recent years, the amount of atmospheric CO2 has increased by an
   average of 1.5 parts per million (ppm) each year, as more greenhouse
   gases are emitted.

   But measurements at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii have shown that
   in 2002 and 2003 the increase was more than two ppm.

   The observatory, operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (Noaa), has measured CO2 levels continuously for almost
   half a century.

   MAUNA LOA CO2 DATA

   1993: 357.04 ppm
   1994: 358.88 ppm
   1995: 360.88 ppm
   1996: 362.64 ppm
   1997: 363.76 ppm
   1998: 366.63 ppm
   1999: 368.31 ppm
   2000: 369.48 ppm
   2001: 371.02 ppm
   2002: 373.10 ppm
   2003: 375.64 ppm

   The mean for the 12 months of each year

   Last March it reported that it had measured them at 379 ppm

   Natural events are known to cause CO2 levels to fluctuate. One example
   is the periodic El Niño weather pattern in the South Pacific, which
   lets the oceans emit rather than absorb carbon.

   But there was no strong El Niño effect in 2002 and 2003, prompting some
   scientists to speculate that the Earth's systems are becoming less able
   to absorb CO2.

   If they are right, that could mean the onset of upsets predicted in a
   warming climate - melting ice, sea-level rise, and chaotic weather -
   could happen much sooner than expected.

   But several British scientists are urging caution before anyone leaps
   to such apocalyptic conclusions.

   Sir David told BBC News the 2 ppm rise of the last two years is "likely
   to be an anomaly, which would not be unprecedented, and not the start
   of a trend, unless it is proved otherwise".

   Dr Peter Cox heads the carbon cycle group at the UK Met Office's Hadley
   Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.

   He said the increase in CO2 was not uniform across the globe, and
   suspected something unusual had happened in the Northern Hemisphere.

   Dr Cox suggested Europe's very hot 2003 summer and a larger than usual
   number of forest fires could have killed off vegetation and increased
   carbon releases from the soil.

   He too was cautious about interpreting the Mauna Loa data, and said it
   was possible to read too much into two years' figures.

   Dr David Hofmann, of Noaa, told the Guardian newspaper on Monday: "I
   don't think an increase of 2 ppm for two years in a row is highly
   significant - there are climatic perturbations that can make this
   occur.

   "But the absence of a known climatic event does make these years
   unusual... I would say it was too soon to say that a new trend has been
   established, but it warrants close scrutiny."

   Stolen relics go home to Egypt

   The Great Pyramids in Egypt
   Egypt proved the origin of the antiquities four months ago

   More than 600 Egyptian antiquities flew back to Egypt from the UK on
   Thursday, four years after they were stolen and smuggled out.

   Wadia Hanna from Egypt's prosecutor-general's office said the items
   were stolen before being shipped to London via Switzerland.

   They were seized by British authorities at Heathrow airport.

   They include two pharaoh coffins inscribed with hieroglyphics and
   ceramics from the Greek era.

   "This is a great achievement," said Mr Hanna.

   Egypt has stepped up efforts to stop smuggling and corruption in the
   last few years.

   Rosetta stone

   Earlier this year, a regional conference in Egypt called on Western
   museums to return "stolen" Middle Eastern artefacts to their country of
   origin.

   Lawyers taking part in the event said monuments such as the Rosetta
   Stone at the British Museum had been plundered and should be handed
   back.

   Shaheen Abou-Alfoutouh, one of the Egyptian organisers, said the West
   should agree to protect human heritage.

   The Rosetta Stone was crucial in the early deciphering of
   hieroglyphics. It was found in Egypt by the French in 1799, but later
   fell into British hands.

   "The way the Rosetta Stone was taken from Egypt by France was illegal,
   and the way it ended up in the British Museum was also illegal," said
   Mr Abou-Alfoutouh at the conference in February.

   "We think it's no less important than the three pyramids of Egypt or
   the Sphinx."

   Schumacher suffers grid penalty

   Michael Schumacher's car catches fire after a crash in Saturday
   practice
   Schumacher's car was badly damaged in the crash

   Michael Schumacher will be penalised 10 grid places for Sunday's
   Brazilian Grand Prix after a crash in practice forced him to race his
   spare Ferrari.

   Schumacher will be demoted to 18th after setting only the eighth
   fastest qualifying time, 0.740secs slower than team-mate Rubens
   Barrichello's pole.

   Schumacher was forced to switch to the spare car after the crash led to
   a fire in the engine bay of his race car.

   Formula One rules say drivers must use the same engine throughout a
   weekend.

   The world champion lost control on bumps at Interlagos' Ferra Dura turn
   and slammed backwards into a barrier.

   Grandstand discussion area:
   Who will win in Brazil?

   Schumacher's crash happened just two minutes before the end of the
   session and severely damaged the rear of his car.

   "Very simply, I lost the car. I couldn't control it anymore, I went
   into oversteer, that's why I went off," he said.

   Barrichello set a lap of one minute 10.229 seconds, with Schumacher set
   the second fastest, 0.123 seconds behind.

   McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was third, just ahead of team-mate David
   Coulthard.

   Sudan ultimatum over US embassy

   Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail The animosity between
   Sudan and the US is deep rooted

   Khartoum has threatened to close the US embassy in Sudan unless a bank
   is found for its mission in Washington.

   The Sudanese embassy in Washington has been unable to find a new bank
   after its previous lender was fined $25m for suspected money laundering
   violations.

   Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said the US had until the
   end of the month to resolve the problem.

   Relations between the two countries have been strained over the crisis
   in Sudan's western Darfur region.

   Animosity

   "They failed to make it possible for our embassy in Washington to have
   an account in any of the American banks," Mr Ismail told the BBC's
   Network Africa programme.

   "This is the direct responsibility of the host country. We've been
   waiting for three months.

   "If it is not settled there is no way the Sudan embassy will continue.
   And on a reciprocal basis, there is no way for the US embassy to
   continue here," he said.

   In response, US officials in Washington say they are close to a deal to
   resolve the long-running dispute.

   Several embassies in Washington are reported to have suffered the same
   problem after Riggs Bank, which traditionally serves the diplomatic
   community, was fined by US regulators for alleged violations of the
   Bank Secrecy Act.

   But the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum, says the animosity between
   Sudan and the US is deep rooted.

   Sudan has long accused the US of supporting rebels both in the south of
   the country and in Darfur, our correspondent says.

   And the US was the first country to accuse Sudan of waging a genocide
   in Darfur, where some 70,000 have died since the conflict began in
   February 2003.

   Thai elder killed 'in revenge'

   A Thai police officer transports a Buddhist monk on his motorcycle
   after a morning alms collecting in Pattani province, southern Thailand
   Sunday, Oct. 31, 2004.
   Buddhists have been targeted during nine months of violence

   A Buddhist leader in southern Thailand has been beheaded in apparent
   revenge for the deaths last week of 85 Muslims.

   Local people found the head of the 58-year-old deputy village leader on
   a roadside in Narathiwat province.

   The incident came as Thailand named a panel to investigate last week's
   deaths, and how dozens of people came to suffocate inside army trucks.

   The army commander in charge of southern Thailand has been moved from
   his post and will return to Bangkok.

   Lt-Gen Pisarn Wattanawongkeeree told reporters he had requested to be
   moved while the investigation was under way.

   "I am ready to face any outcome of the investigation," he said.

   The man found beheaded was a deputy village leader. Police in the
   Sukhirin district of Narathiwat province said he was thought to have
   been shot first, the Associated Press reported.

   AREAS OF UNREST

   Survivors' journey to hell
   Thailand's restive south

   His corpse was discovered more than 1km (0.6 miles) away from his head.
   He is the second Buddhist to be beheaded in the region in recent
   months.

   A hand-written note was found by the head, saying: "This is revenge for
   the innocent Muslim youths who were massacred at the Takbai protest,"
   officials said.

   Thailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is under fire for the
   handling of the Takbai protest, in which dozens of Muslims youths were
   bundled into army vans without enough air to breathe and 78 died.

   Panel named

   Seven others died during the protest itself, which was held outside a
   police station to demonstrate against the detention of six Muslim men
   on weapons charges.

   On Tuesday, Mr Thaksin named the investigators who will launch an
   inquiry into the case.

   The panel includes three Muslims. It will report its findings to the
   prime minister by 2 December.

   Most of the survivors of Takbai have now been released, according to
   Reuters news agency.

   Police have charged 58 people with unlawful gathering and threatening
   officials.

   Another 131 men were obliged to take a 42-day job training course at
   another military camp, police said.

   Islamic leaders had warned that the Takbai incident could trigger
   reprisal attacks in Thailand's south.

   Just hours after the village leader's remains were found, a Buddhist
   family was injured in an ambush as they were heading home on a
   motorbike in Narathiwat.

   More than 400 people have died so far this year in unrest in the
   region. The south of Thailand is home to many of the country's Muslim
   minority, who have long complained of discrimination by the
   authorities.

   Suspected Muslim militants have targeted Buddhists - who make up the
   majority of Thailand - and officials, in shooting and bomb attacks,
   although Thai security forces have been responsible for many of the
   deaths.

   US snubs Greece over Macedonia

   US Ambassador to Greece Thomas Miller leaves Greek Foreign Ministry
   Greece summoned the US envoy to make a formal complaint

   Greece has protested strongly at a decision by the US to refer to the
   Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) simply as "Macedonia".

   Greece has waged a long campaign to deny its northern neighbour use of
   the Macedonia name, which is also that of a northern Greek province.

   FYROM President Branko Crvenkovski hailed a "great day" for his
   country.

   Greece has made a formal complaint at "this unilateral US decision",
   saying it would have "many negative effects".

   A US State Department official told BBC News that: "The US has decided
   to refer to Macedonia as the Republic of Macedonia."

   Today is a great day for Macedonia and all Macedonians wherever they
   are

   Branko Crvenkovski
   Macedonian president

   Macedonia's name saga

   The US said the decision was not meant to anger Greece, but to reward
   Macedonia for its commitment to democracy, the AFP news agency said.

   Foreign ministry spokesman George Koumoutsakos said US Secretary of
   State Colin Powell had telephoned to say "that the decision is not a
   turn against Greece and is not linked to the US elections".

   Greece and FYROM have held United Nations-led talks on the issue for
   more a decade.

   'Negative effects'

   The BBC's Matt Prodger says the US move will be a boost for the
   Macedonian government ahead of a controversial referendum aimed at
   overturning legislation giving more rights to the minority ethnic
   Albanians.

   "Today is a great day for Macedonia and all Macedonians wherever they
   are," Mr Crvenkovski said.

   "My message to the Greek government and to the Greek people is that the
   Republic of Macedonia is strongly determined to continue to build
   friendly and good-neighbourly relations."

   But Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said: "Apart from our
   protest, I noted the many negative effects that this unilateral US
   decision will have."

   He has cancelled a trip to the EU summit in Brussels to deal with the
   issue.

   Embargo

   Successive Greek governments have refused to recognise the name
   "Macedonia", because they fear it implies a territorial claim on the
   northern Greek province of that name.

   The name is also seen as a part of Greek heritage.

   The dispute began with the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in 1991.

   Greece imposed an economic embargo on its neighbour until it agreed to
   be referred to as the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" - a name
   which most of its inhabitants dislike.

   Last month, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signed a co-operation
   agreement referring to the country simply as Macedonia.

   Hopes and fears for Blair's US trip
   Analysis
   By Nick Assinder
   Political Correspondent, BBC News website
   The sight of Tony Blair dashing off to Washington as the first
   international leader to visit President Bush seems designed to
   infuriate Labour backbenchers.

   Tony Blair and George Bush
   Mr Blair hopes to get movement on peace process

   Those who are already deeply unhappy about the close relationship
   between their leader and a Republican president believe this is more
   evidence of who is pulling whose strings.

   There is already a feeling of depression and anger on the Labour back
   benches at the failure of "their" candidate, John Kerry, to throw Mr
   Bush out of the White House.

   Yet the prime minister has left no time for recovery before he prepared
   to jet off to reinforce his position as the president's greatest and
   closest ally.

   Watching Mr Blair stand shoulder to shoulder with the president as the
   battle for Falluja continues will only serve to keep the anger at the
   alliance and the war near boiling point.

   So there is an undoubted gamble for the prime minister in this trip.

   He has, however, clearly calculated that there are also things to be
   gained from this visit at this time.

   Peace process

   First off, it is probably better to get it over with now - get all the
   bad news over in one go, as it were.

   But far more than that, the prime minister is taking a direct appeal to
   the president over the Middle East peace process with some predicting
   Yasser Arafat's death may open up new opportunities.

   The talks come amid Falluja battle

   With Labour MPs demanding that Tony Blair proves that his
   much-trumpeted influence with the president is real rather than
   illusory, the prime minister must be confident he can do just that.

   Downing Street has already signalled that a great deal of behind the
   scenes work has been going on in preparation for some sort of movement
   on the peace process.

   Spokesmen refuse to talk in terms of what the prime minister will get
   from the president, insisting it is not that sort of relationship.

   It is more about working together in a process to reach the right
   decisions.

   And, in this instance, it will be about them, offering a "signal of
   intent" on the peace process.

   Empty promises

   The reality is, we already know what the prime minister's intent is. He
   has declared both in his party conference speech in the autumn and in
   comments since the US election that re-injecting momentum into the
   stalled peace process is his priority.

   So it is to win a similar pledge from the president that is undoubtedly
   top of Mr Blair's agenda.

   Getting the deal would clearly help the prime minister's standing with
   his backbenchers, the Muslim community and voters disturbed by the war.

   Tony Blair
   Blair needs to show influence

   But it would need to be accompanied by some sort of action if it is not
   to appear like empty promises designed purely to give Mr Blair some
   breathing space.

   And that is where the problem lies. The crisis surrounding the
   Palestinian leadership complicates issues. It may open up new
   opportunities, but it may also make immediate progress difficult.

   Climate change

   And nobody can be exactly sure how a second term Bush presidency will
   behave and whether, for example, he will feel the need to address the
   peace process head on.

   Disgruntled backbenchers and voters may at least be reassured to see
   the prime minister putting his conference words into practice.

   Similarly, Mr Blair will want to put trade, US-EU relations and,
   crucially, climate change, firmly on the agenda.

   These are equally difficult areas and, again, there is no guarantee Mr
   Bush will play ball.

   But the prime minister will want to show that, on these issues too, he
   is making a powerful case with the president.

   All this might help ease the tight spot he is in with his natural
   supporters at home.

   But this meeting will be scrutinised through an extremely sceptical and
   critical microscope by the prime minister's detractors.

   Queen honours nation's war dead

   The Queen laid a wreath along with other Royals and MPs
   The Queen laid a wreath along with other Royals and MPs

   The Queen led the tributes to Britain's war dead at the Cenotaph in
   London on Remembrance Sunday.

   Following a two-minute silence, the Queen laid a poppy wreath in memory
   of the dead, including 21 troops killed in Iraq this year.

   Her grandson Prince William took part in the National Service of
   Remembrance for the first time.

   Political leaders, including Tony Blair, joined some 9,000 veterans
   from 20th century conflicts at the event.

   Two-minute silence

   The Queen, dressed in black, emerged from the old Home Office building
   in Whitehall just before 11am and took up her position facing the
   Cenotaph.

   At the first stoke of Big Ben at 1100GMT, a single round was fired from
   a field gun to signal the start of a two-minute silence.

   The boom of a second round of cannon fire, from the King's Troop Royal
   Horse Artillery positioned on Horse Guards Parade, broke the silence.

   The Prince of Wales, who is 56 on Sunday, laid a poppy wreath, along
   with the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of York, the Princess
   Royal and Duke of Kent.

   Mr Blair and other political leaders, including for the first time
   Northern Ireland's Rev Dr Ian Paisley, then laid wreaths, followed by
   Commonwealth High Commissioners and military top brass.

   When all the wreaths had been laid, there was a short religious service
   conducted by Bishop of London Richard Chartres.

   Prince William, with Sophie, Countess of Wessex, was watching the
   wreath-laying and march past from a first-floor balcony in the Foreign
   Office, overlooking Whitehall.

   The Normandy veterans led the march as the military mass bands played
   the March of the Veterans of Normandy.

   Representatives of the War Widows' Association marched with the
   ex-service contingent.

   As well as the 9,000 veterans marching or taking part in wheelchairs,
   some 1,500 civilians were also on parade.

   And the Princess Royal, who is Commandant-in-Chief of the Women's Royal
   Naval Services, took the salute at Horse Guards of the columns of
   ex-servicemen and women taking part in the traditional march pass.

   Across the rest of the UK, cities and towns held their own services.

   Prince Edward led the laying of the wreaths in Edinburgh.

   First Minister Jack McConnell said it was important to honour those who
   had made the ultimate sacrifice.

   In Northern Ireland the main service was held in City Hall in Belfast.

   Almost 50,000 people from Ireland died in the First World War.

   In Llandudno, north Wales, the brother of Llywelyn Evans, the first
   Welsh solder to die in the Iraq war, laid a wreath.

   Iraq police 'kidnap' questioned

   Map showing Iraqi-Jordanian border area

   There are conflicting reports about the fate of at least 30 Iraqi
   policemen in western Iraq.

   The group was apparently ambushed by 20 armed men in the town of
   Rutbah, near the Jordanian border, on Sunday.

   Reports said the men, many of whom were believed to come from the
   Diyala province, were seized as they returned home after a training
   course in Jordan.

   Some reports quote police sources in Karbala, but the chief of police
   in the city said none of his men were missing.

   A Karbala police spokesman, who spoke under condition of anonymity,
   said earlier that the police officers were seized while they were
   staying in a hotel in the west of the country.

   "There was an attack on a hotel occupied by policemen coming back from
   training in Jordan," he told the Associated Press news agency.

   Clashes

   Last month, nine Iraqi policemen returning from training in Jordan were
   ambushed and killed on their way back to Iraq.

   Reports of the abduction came as violence continued elsewhere in Iraq.

   In the town of Baiji, north of Baghdad, at least 14 Iraqis were killed
   in a car bomb attack on an American patrol and nine people died in
   Ramadi.

   Clashes have also continued in Falluja, where US marines have been
   carrying out house-to-house searches but the northern city of Mosul is
   said to be relatively calm.

   Big setback for US spy shake-up

   US House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert
   Dennis Hastert had to admit defeat in his efforts to get the bill
   through

   Sweeping plans to reform America's intelligence network have run into
   trouble after key Republicans in Congress objected to the legislation.

   House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert cancelled a vote on the
   bill at the last minute, making it unlikely to pass in this session of
   Congress.

   The shake-up, prompted by the Senate 9/11 Commission, would have
   created a new national intelligence director.

   But some senior figures had argued the overhaul went too far, too fast.

   The surprise setback for the President Bush-backed bill comes despite
   the fact that both houses of Congress have already approved the
   measure, known as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act.

   However, the Senate and the House passed radically different versions
   of the bill and a compromise deal had to be negotiated.

   The decision to cancel the vote has drawn sharp criticism from
   Democrats, who say the move has essentially killed any chance for
   intelligence reform this year.

   If the bill cannot be salvaged next month, it will expire at the end of
   this year, forcing lawmakers to start again from scratch when the new
   Congress convenes in January.

   Counter-terrorism

   Mr Hastert withdrew the amended bill after objections by some
   Republican members of the House, including Duncan Hunter, who is
   chairman of the chamber's Armed Services Committee.

   It's hard to reform. It's hard to make changes

   House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert

   Mr Hunter - seen as an important ally of Defence Secretary Donald
   Rumsfeld - was concerned that shifting some intelligence operations
   from the Pentagon could make it difficult for combat troops to get the
   information they needed, Mr Hastert said.

   The Pentagon currently controls 80% of the intelligence budget - and
   some congressional aides accused Mr Rumsfeld's department of conspiring
   to block the bill.

   The intelligence shake-up was prompted by the investigation into the 11
   September 2001 attacks on the US and followed some of its
   recommendations.

   These included the creation of a new national counter-terrorism centre
   with powers to plan operations.

   The Senate 9/11 Commission found that a failure to co-operate between
   15 military and civilian intelligence agencies hampered efforts to
   defend the US in the run-up to the attacks on New York and Washington.

   But Mr Rumsfeld had expressed concerns about the reform, saying it
   might create barriers between intelligence agencies and senior military
   commanders.

   Benazir 'wants to end her exile'

   Benazir Bhutto
   Ms Bhutto spends her exile in the UAE and London

   Former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto says she wants to end her exile, a
   day after her husband was freed on bail after eight years in jail.

   Ms Bhutto went into self-imposed exile in 1999 to avoid corruption
   charges, which are still outstanding.

   She says it will be "good for Pakistan" if she returns to the country.

   Her husband, Asif Zardari, who had faced corruption and conspiracy to
   murder charges, said after being bailed he hoped to "galvanise
   democracy".

   Sharif call

   The BBC's Paul Anderson in Islamabad says the charges against Mr
   Zardari and his wife have not gone away but from the government's side,
   and Mr Zardari's, the talk now is of reconciliation.

   I don't have to leave Pakistan. [My wife] will, Inshallah [God
   willing], come here and I will wait till she comes

   Asif Zardari

   What now for Pakistan?
   Press hails Zardari release
   Benazir's amazing career

   In another conciliatory act a day after Mr Zardari's release, President
   Pervez Musharraf called a second exiled former premier, Nawaz Sharif,
   in Saudi Arabia, to convey his condolences on the death of his father.

   Mr Sharif was toppled by the military in 1999.

   A leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q) party, Syed
   Mushahid Hussein, said of the phone call: "Political differences should
   not be converted into personal enmity and this is what President
   Musharraf demonstrated."

   Ms Bhutto denied any deal had been done with the government to free Mr
   Zardari but said there had been talks between the administration and
   the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which she still leads.

   "No government official met with me, but there have been meetings with
   Asif Zardari and my party leaders for political reconciliation," she
   said.

   'Life and blood'

   Ms Bhutto was twice prime minister of Pakistan. Her governments were
   dissolved in 1990 and 1996 for alleged corruption.

   his release

   She lives in exile in the United Arab Emirates and London with the
   couple's three children.

   Ms Bhutto said on Tuesday: "I want to go back... My children want to
   see their father. I think all exiled leaders must have the right to go
   back to their country, and I say it will be good for Pakistan."

   Mr Zardari told the BBC's World Today programme after his release he
   hoped his wife would return.

   "I don't have to leave Pakistan. [My wife] will, Inshallah [God
   willing], come here and I will wait till she comes."

   Mr Zardari called his release a victory for democracy and for PPP.

   He was released from detention in hospital on Monday in the southern
   city of Karachi, where he was being treated for various ailments.

   He said he now hoped "to bring some life and blood into the workers" of
   the PPP.

   "I intend to galvanise the democratic forces and hopefully lead them to
   victory... in the salvation of democracy lies the future of Pakistan."

   Our correspondent, Paul Anderson, says the release could revitalise the
   PPP, which is still the biggest opposition but has suffered defections
   to the PML-Q.

   However, he says it may not be the time for exiled leaders to return.
   The last recorded stance of the government on Ms Bhutto's position was
   that she would be arrested the moment she set foot in the country.

   Mr Zardari had previously been granted bail in all but one of the cases
   outstanding against him - including conspiring to murder Ms Bhutto's
   brother, Mir Murtaza, in 1996.

   Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday granted bail of 1m rupees ($16,700)
   in the final corruption case against him - the alleged evasion of
   import duties on a car.

   However, charges of corruption and involvement in murder still stand.

   Diplomats probe post-Arafat world
   By Barbara Plett
   BBC Middle East correspondent

   Top diplomats are streaming to Israel and the occupied Palestinian
   territories.

   Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath (left) welcomes US Secretary
   of State Colin Powell Colin Powell has led a series of diplomats to the
   Middle East

   These include the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.

   He follows the American Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Russian
   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and will be followed in the coming
   weeks by foreign ministers from Germany and Spain.

   They all insist that the death of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
   represents a new beginning for the bloodied Israeli-Palestinian peace
   process.

   But does it?

   For the last two years Washington has said any movement towards peace
   talks depends on the Palestinians electing a new leadership.

   Now, with Mr Arafat's death, they can. But that does not necessarily
   mean there will be movement toward peace talks.

   Powell welcomed

   The US and Britain see presidential elections as crucial to bolstering
   the legitimacy of any post-Arafat leadership, particularly moderate
   leaders like PLO chairman Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister
   Ahmed Qurei.

   On Monday, Mr Powell told reporters he had been encouraged by the
   Palestinian Authority's commitment to reform.

   Palestinians Ahmed Qurei and Mahmoud Abbas
   Ahmed Qurei and Mahmoud Abbas want sound ties with the US

   He also said he had got a degree of commitment from Israel to
   facilitate the election, scheduled for 9 January.

   Israeli officials spoke of easing travel restrictions to allow
   Palestinian candidates and voters freedom of movement.

   And they suggested they could come to an arrangement that would allow
   Palestinians living in occupied East Jerusalem to vote.

   Mr Abbas and Mr Qurei welcomed Colin Powell's visit and will of course
   welcome those who come after him.

   They know a sound relationship with the United States is the surest way
   to influence Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and thus
   build support in the Palestinian street for their moderate line.

   So they were happy to see the US Secretary of State once more in
   Jericho.

   They were less happy with the answers he gave them.

   For example, he did not accede to their central demand that Israel's
   plan to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza should be negotiated with the
   Palestinians as part of the peace plan known as "the roadmap".

   No ceasefire deal

   The most Mr Powell and Israeli officials would say is that
   disengagement could perhaps be co-ordinated with the Palestinians.

   However, they stressed there would be no return to the roadmap until
   the Palestinians had fulfilled their obligations to curb incitement and
   halt violence against Israel.

   Nor was there any real support for Mr Abbas's main policy initiative.
   This is to agree a Palestinian ceasefire in the run up to the
   presidential election.

   But the Palestinian factions say they will only stop the violence if
   Israel does too.

   A Palestinian car hit by a missile
   Palestinians say Israeli assassinations must stop

   Above all they want an end to Israel's military raids and its
   assassination of Palestinian activists.

   Mr Powell ruled out any formal ceasefire. So has Israel - apparently in
   deed as well as word.

   On Sunday night an undercover army unit killed three militants in the
   West Bank city of Ramallah.

   Israel said the soldiers returned fire after they were shot at. But
   accounts by three different Palestinian human rights groups said it was
   an extra-judicial killing.

   Mr Abbas reportedly told Colin Powell that, as long as such Israeli
   actions continued, he and Mr Qurei would be powerless to prevent
   violent Palestinian reactions.

   Assassinations are "the biggest threat to the continuation of
   Palestinian rule and our ability to hold elections on 9 January in an
   optimal fashion", one senior Palestinian official told Israel's
   Ha'aretz newspaper.

   'Death squad' dismantled in Gaza

   Al-Aqsa members at demonstration in support of Mahmoud Abbas, carrying
   pictures of Yasser Arafat
   The al-Aqsa brigades are to be merged with other militias

   The Palestinian Authority has said it is disbanding a small security
   unit in Gaza accused of human rights abuses.

   A senior official said the 70 members of the Department of Protection
   and Security, known as the "Death Squad", would be re-assigned to other
   units.

   The unit was formed more than a year ago in response to attacks by
   opposition factions against the Palestinian Authority.

   Critics say some of the unit's members turned into criminals.

   We must clear the air of past mistakes

   Rashid Abu Shbak
   Palestinian security official

   They allegedly confiscated land, smuggled weapons and intimidated the
   public.

   Correspondents say Palestinian reformers, as well as Israeli and
   American officials, have long demanded a major overhaul of the
   Palestinian security services.

   Meanwhile the interim Palestinian leadership has arrived in Cairo for
   talks with Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

   They are expected to discuss January's elections for a Palestinian
   Authority president.

   But violence continued on Saturday, with the killing of a lecturer in
   an explosion at Gaza's al-Azhar University.

   Reuters news agency quoted Palestinian security sources as saying the
   violence was part of internal unrest.

   'Farewell to chaos'

   Rashid Abu Shbak, head of Palestinian preventive security, said the
   unit had become "a source of accusation and doubts".

   "We are facing a new phase and we must say farewell to chaos and to all
   those who cause it in the Palestinian street," he said. "We must clear
   the air of past mistakes of the previous era."

   Mr Shbak, who is an official in the Fatah movement, also said Fatah
   would merge its armed militias, including the al-Aqsa Martyrs'
   Brigades, a militant group responsible for suicide bombings and other
   attacks on Israelis.

   He said there had to be a centralised leadership which was responsible
   for their actions.

   Correspondents say the disbanding of the unit follows calls for a
   shake-up of competing security forces and anti-corruption reforms as
   lawlessness rages in the West Bank and Gaza.

   Mahmoud Abbas hopes to curb the unrest ahead of presidential elections
   on 9 January, they say.

   Mr Abbas' position as frontrunner in the election has been strengthened

   India edge ahead in Calcutta
   Second Test, Calcutta, day three (stumps):
   South Africa 305 v India 359-6
   Full scorecard

   Rahul Dravid
   Dravid's fears are realised as his bails are dislodged by Hall

   India were establishing a handy lead over South Africa when bad light
   brought an early end to the third day's play of the second Test in
   Calcutta.

   The hosts led by 54 runs on 359-6 at stumps, with Dinesh Karthik (35)
   and Irfan Pathan (21) putting on 51 unbroken runs for the seventh
   wicket.

   Virender Sehwag went for 88 in the morning, and Rahul Dravid also had a
   ton in sight before falling for 80.

   Makhaya Ntini was the most impressive of the visiting attack with 2-85.

   Resuming the day on 129-1, India added only 15 runs before Sehwag was
   caught in gully off a brutish short ball from Ntini.

   Sachin Tendulkar's indifferent run of form continued when he misjudged
   an off-drive and played Zander de Bruyn (2-32) onto his stumps for 20,
   leaving India 198-3 at lunch.

   Nakhaya Ntini
   Ntini is suitably ecstatic after ousting Sehwag with a fine bouncer

   Dravid, 33 overnight, doubled his boundary tally to eight and was
   looking sharp but he was one of two batsmen to fall in the afternoon,
   bowled by Andrew Hall off an inside edge.

   Skipper Sourav Ganguly was the other, dubiously given out lbw to de
   Bruyn for 40 despite the ball pitching outside leg-stump and possibly
   not hitting the stumps.

   VVS Laxman did not look entirely comfortable at the crease, and on 38
   he drove loosely at Ntini and was caught by Justin Ontong at point.

   India were just three runs ahead at that point, and it spoke volumes
   for the competitiveness of South Africa that India's best partnership
   of the day was left to the seventh wicket.

   Both Karthik and Pathan were supremely watchful, and they will look to
   reap the rewards on day four.

   Sri Lanka rebuffs rebels' demands

   Tamil Tigers in eastern Sri Lanka
   The Tigers pulled out of direct talks in April last year

   Sri Lanka's government has rejected demands from Tamil Tiger rebels to
   unconditionally resume peace talks.

   The rebels threatened at the weekend to return to military action
   unless discussions based on their blueprint for self-rule began again.

   But the government says any talks must take place alongside
   negotiations for a final political solution to the decades-old
   conflict.

   Talks to resolve the conflict stalled some 19 months ago.

   The Tigers want their interim proposals discussed and implemented
   before talks on a final solution begin.

   The government says the two must go in tandem, and that it is
   impossible to have an interim process without knowing where it is
   leading.

   'Freedom struggle'

   The government has rejected the rebel demands but says it remains
   committed to discussing their proposals for an interim self-governing
   authority in areas they control.

   It said in a statement on Wednesday: "Threats won't help start peace
   talks.

   "A call, couched in threatening language, from the [Tamil Tigers] for a
   resumption of negotiations without conditions, while setting conditions
   itself by insisting unilaterally on a single agenda item is scarcely
   conducive to good-faith negotiations."

   The announcement was the government's first reaction to a statement
   issued by Tamil Tiger rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran on Saturday.

   He warned the Tigers may resume what he called the freedom struggle of
   the Tamil people if there was any further delay to peace talks.

   Negotiations

   During an annual radio broadcast to mark the rebels' war dead, he said
   they had "reached the limits of patience".

   A ceasefire between the two sides has remained largely intact since
   February 2002, even though the Tigers pulled out of negotiations in
   April last year, saying the government was not honouring pledges it had
   made.

   The Tigers have been fighting for more than two decades for
   self-government in the north and east, which they consider the Tamil
   homeland.

   More than 60,000 people have been killed in the course of the conflict.

   The rebels' proposal calls for a largely independent territory with
   control over its own administration, police and legal system,
   unrestricted access to the sea, and the right to collect taxes and
   receive direct foreign aid.

   Ukraine set for election showdown

   Yanukovych supporters at a rally in Donetsk
   Yanukovych supporters voiced their anger at the ruling

   Ukraine's Moscow-backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych has confirmed
   he will contest the re-run of the disputed presidential poll on 26
   December.

   He spoke a day after the Supreme Court ruled that last month's run-off,
   which gave him victory over opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, had
   been fraudulent.

   Mr Yanukovych angrily attacked the ruling, saying it was
   unconstitutional.

   Parliament, meanwhile, failed to adopt electoral law changes the
   opposition said were needed to prevent fraud.

   The emergency session was adjourned until 14 December without passing a
   package of bills that would reshuffle the central electoral commission
   and make other key changes to ensure fair balloting in the repeat
   run-off.

   The chances of democracy prevailing are significantly higher now. This
   is not, however, time to relax. More work needs to be done - in
   particular, the number of observers must be increased

   Court ruling: Your views
   Yanukovych camp angered
   Yushchenko sitting pretty

   Ukraine's Socialists and Communists had promised to vote for the
   amendments if the opposition supported a constitutional reform aimed at
   trimming presidential powers.

   But the deal collapsed after pro-Yushchenko lawmakers said they would
   only consider the constitutional changes after the electoral amendments
   were approved.

   The central election commission met on Saturday to fix 26 December as
   the date for the new poll, a decision which needs parliament's and
   President Leonid Kuchma's approval.

   'No choice'

   "I am certain the Supreme Court's decision is a violation of the
   Ukrainian constitution and that it was taken under pressure from the
   street," Mr Yanukovych said in a statement given to journalists.

   "Without any doubt I have no other choice but to run again and to win,"
   he said.

   The BBC's Stephen Mulvey reports from Kiev that there had been
   speculation that the outgoing president was considering backing another
   candidate with popular appeal outside the east of the country.

   Mr Yanukovych's supporters were angry at the ruling and vowed to vote
   for him again.

   At a meeting in the eastern city of Kharkiv on Saturday, officials from
   Ukraine's eastern and southern regions - where Mr Yanukovych enjoys
   strong support - urged both Mr Yanukovych and Mr Yushchenko to withdraw
   from the contest.

   The meeting also discussed calls for greater regional autonomy.

   The original 21 November run-off had been criticised by Western
   observers over what they said were numerous irregularities.

   The prime minister and President Kuchma had pressed for a completely
   new election. Mr Kuchma has yet to issue his response to the court
   ruling.

   But Mr Yushchenko wanted - and got - a re-run of the second round only.

   Thousands of opposition protesters celebrated through the night after
   the verdict, which came after nearly a fortnight of street
   demonstrations in the capital.

   Finland tops global school table

   Helsinki classroom
   Finnish pupils spend the shortest amount of time in lessons

   Finland's claim to have the best school system has been reinforced by
   the latest international comparisons.

   First results from the PISA study of 40 countries put it top overall in
   the maths, reading and science tests.

   PISA is a three-yearly appraisal of 15 year olds in the principal
   industrialised countries, organised by the OECD economic grouping.

   The UK as a whole was excluded for failing to provide enough results,
   though Northern Ireland did well.

   Maths focus

   PISA - the Programme for International Student Assessment - aims to
   assess the knowledge and skills needed for full participation in
   society, rather than mastery of a curriculum.

   Chart showing best and worst maths proficiency The 2003 PISA study
   focused on mathematics

   It compares Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   (OECD) member nations and "partner countries" and regions, such as
   Russia and Brazil.

   The tests were taken by more than a quarter of a million students,
   representing about 23 million in the participating countries.

   The focus of the 2003 study was mathematics, with problems mainly set
   in real-world situations, covering space and shape, change and
   relationships, quantity and uncertainty.

   Hong Kong had a slightly higher mean score than Finland but on overall
   proficiency, Finland came top, ahead of South Korea then Canada, with
   Indonesia bottom.

   The OECD used seven proficiency levels in increasing order of skill,
   from "below Level 1" to Level 6.

   BEST MEAN SCORES: MATHS

   Hong Kong-China: 550
   Finland: 544
   South Korea: 542
   Netherlands: 538
   Liechtenstein: 536

   Source: OECD PISA 2003 data

   Half or more of the 15-year-olds reached at least Level 4 in Finland,
   South Korea and Hong Kong.

   In Mexico, only 3% did so - with an even lower percentage in Indonesia
   and Tunisia.

   In most countries that are members of the OECD, at least three quarters
   of students reached Level 2 - but more than a quarter were unable to
   complete those tasks in Italy, Portugal and the US.

   "These students fail to demonstrate consistently that they have
   baseline mathematical skills," the report said.

   Internal variations

   The authors caution that - in line with previous international
   comparisons - only about one tenth of the variation in student
   performance on the overall mathematics scale lies between countries.

   SAMPLE MATHS QUESTIONS

   Have a go at some of the problems the students were asked to tackle.

   More details

   Most is within countries - between education systems and programmes,
   between schools and between students within schools.

   For example, in Belgium, mean scores on the maths scale for the Flemish
   community were higher than those in the best-performing OECD countries,
   Finland and South Korea.

   There was a particular problem with Year 11 pupils who tend not to
   return to school after their exams

   UK National Statistics

   Why the UK missed out

   Results from the French community, however, were at the OECD average.

   Both Germany and the Republic of Ireland scored near to the OECD
   average but the range of performance within Ireland was one of the
   narrowest, while the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles
   in Germany was among the widest.

   Gender gap

   In "reading literacy", the overall results found Finland, South Korea
   and Canada at the top, and Indonesia again bringing up the rear.

   BEST MEAN SCORES: READING

   Finland: 543
   South Korea: 534
   Canada: 528
   Australia: 525
   Liechtenstein: 525

   On the science scores, four entrants had statistically
   indistinguishable high average performances: Finland, Japan, Hong
   Kong-China and South Korea.

   The OECD report also considers gender differences.

   In maths, it said much remained to be done to close the gap which saw
   boys outperforming girls.

   BEST MEAN SCORES: SCIENCE

   Finland: 548
   Japan: 548
   Hong Kong-China: 539
   South Korea: 538
   Liechtenstein: 525
   Australia: 525
   Macao-China: 525

   In reading, girls had "significantly higher average performance" in all
   countries except Liechtenstein. The biggest gap was in Iceland.

   Science showed the smallest average gender gap, with boys doing a
   little better.

   Girls performed significantly better than boys only in Finland, Iceland
   and Tunisia.

   Egyptian anger over 'spy' release

   Some of the students on their way back to Egypt
   The six students had not been charged by Israel

   There has been a public outcry in Egypt at the exchange of a convicted
   Israeli spy for six Egyptian students charged with plotting to kill
   Israeli soldiers.

   Opposition politicians and even the students' families criticised the
   deal.

   The father of one student said a spy who had harmed Egypt should not
   have been bartered for "innocent students".

   Azzam Azzam himself - a member of Israel's ethnically Arab Druze
   minority - has categorically denied he acted as an agent for the
   Israeli state.

   Someone that has harmed Egypt and the Egyptian people should not have
   been swapped with innocent students

   Yusri Salem
   Father of Mohammed Yusri

   The Egyptian students - Muhammad Yusri, Muhammad Maher, Moustafa
   Mahmoud, Moustafa Abu Deif, Mahmoud Ezzat and Emad Sayyed - said they
   entered Israel by mistake during a holiday in al-Arish in the Sinai
   peninsula.

   "This deal is a sign of the demeaning and dishonouring of Egypt and the
   Arabs by the Israelis," said Diaa Eddin Daud of the opposition
   Nasserist party

   "Nothing can justify this gift for Israel at time when it is increasing
   its aggression against the Palestinians and the Arabs," said Hussein
   Abdel Razzek of Tagammu.

   Early release

   Egypt insists that technically it had not been an exchange of prisoners
   - because the decision to release Azzam for good behaviour had been
   taken in October.

   It claimed implementation had been delayed until Israel released the
   students.

   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon welcomed Azzam home. He also
   insisted the charges had been baseless.

   Azzam, an Israeli textiles worker, served half of a 15 year prison
   term.

   He was convicted of helping to send news about Egyptian industrial
   cities to Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad.

   He was said to have communicated secret messages in invisible ink
   written on women's underwear.

   Critics of the conviction said there was no need to have resorted to
   such an elaborate method in the modern information age.

   Rapprochement

   BBC correspondent Simon Wilson says the release of Azzam - whose
   imprisonment was a frequent point of friction - comes amid signs of a
   possible improvement in relations between Egypt and Israel.

   Egypt is reported to be considering sending an ambassador back to Tel
   Aviv after a long absence and taking on a security role in the Gaza
   Strip, with Israel due to pull out next year.

   The two countries signed a peace deal in 1979, but relations have
   remained cool and worsened after the beginning of the Palestinian
   intifada in 2000.

   The state security court in Cairo sentenced Azzam, 41, a member of
   Israel's minority Druze community, to 15 years in prison in August
   1997.

   An Egyptian accomplice, Emad Abdel-Hamid Ismail, was given 25 years.

   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is now considering shortening the
   sentences of some Palestinian militants as part of the rapprochement -
   which comes in the wake of the death last month of veteran Palestinian
   leader Yasser Arafat.

   Thai PM heads for Burma visit
   By Kylie Morris
   BBC News, Bangkok

   Buddhists worship at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
   Buddhists from 20 countries are scheduled to visit Burma

   Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra is to visit neighbouring Burma on
   Thursday.

   It is his first trip to Rangoon since the sacking of his friend, former
   Burmese Prime Minister Khin Nyunt.

   Khin Nyunt was ousted in October by Burma's ruling conservative
   generals and replaced by an apparent hardliner, Lt Gen Soe Win.

   Mr Thaksin is expected to speak at an international Buddhist summit,
   although many of the participants have declined their invitations.

   This is a multi-purpose visit by the Thai prime minister.

   He needs to build new relationships with the generals who ousted Khin
   Nyunt, a man who Thaksin Shinawatra once regarded as a friend.

   But Mr Thaksin is unlikely to see him as he is now thought to be under
   house arrest.

   Buddhist disquiet

   Thailand invested heavily in Burma's development under the previous
   leadership, so there will no doubt be questions as to how those funds
   might now be spent.

   And there will be questions too about the generals' plans for
   democracy.

   Burma barely escaped public criticism as the recent Asean summit,
   thanks only to Thailand's intervention.

   Now Mr Thaksin is expected to raise the issue with Senior General Than
   Shwe.

   He is also in town to offer legitimacy to the World Buddhist Summit, an
   international gathering of Buddhists which has been somewhat deflated
   by the withdrawal of the co-organisers, a Japanese Buddhist sect.

   The Nenbutsushu group pulled out in the wake of the recent political
   upheaval in Burma, but, undaunted, the government has decided to go
   ahead.

   The original organisers have predicted that many countries will not
   attend.

   One in 10 families 'pays bribes'

   Dollar bills
   The World Bank estimates that more than $1,000bn is paid out in bribes
   every year

   One in 10 people says they or a member of their household has paid a
   bribe in the past year, according to a global opinion survey published
   on Thursday.

   It suggests that Cameroon is the most corrupt country, as a majority of
   those surveyed there admitted paying bribes.

   It was followed by Nigeria, Kenya, Lithuania and Moldova - all
   countries where at least one in three people admitted paying bribes.

   Transparency International released its poll to mark UN Anti-Corruption
   Day.

   It was based on the responses of more than 50,000 people in 64
   countries

   While most countries where a high level of bribery was reported were
   relatively poor, there were exceptions to this rule.

   Some 11% of Greeks reported that they or a member of their household
   had paid a bribe in the past year.

   South Africans, by contrast, admitted paying bribes at similarly low
   levels to most developed countries.

   Parties 'most corrupt'

   People across the world perceive political parties as the institutions
   most affected by corruption, the survey suggests.

   They are followed by parliaments, police and the judiciary in being
   seen as corrupt.

   Akere Muna, a Transparency International board member and president of
   the anti-corruption body's Cameroon branch, said: "It is time to use
   international co-operation to enforce a policy of zero tolerance of
   political corruption, and to put an end to practices whereby
   politicians put themselves above the law - stealing from ordinary
   citizens and hiding behind parliamentary immunity.

   "Political parties and the politicians they nominate for election are
   entrusted with great power and great hopes by the people who vote for
   them. Political leaders must not abuse that trust by serving corrupt or
   selfish interests once they are in power."

   The survey was conducted for Transparency International by Gallup
   International as part of its Voice of the People Survey between June
   and September 2004.

   Convention

   The Berlin-based pressure group, founded by a former World Bank
   official after he encountered corruption in Africa, has been a prime
   mover behind the idea of the UN World Anti-Corruption Day

   Events are being held in several countries on Thursday to mark the
   first such day. It aims to highlight the scale of the problem and
   efforts to fight it.

   Nations including Bangladesh, Germany, Colombia and Morocco are marking
   the occasion with workshops, rallies, and the release of research.

   The World Bank estimates that more than $1 trillion is paid out in
   bribes every year around the globe.

   This particular date, 9 December, was picked as it marks the first
   anniversary of the launch of the UN convention against corruption at a
   conference in Mexico.

   The anti-bribery rules set out in the convention will come into force
   when 30 countries have signed up to it - so far 12 have, according to
   Transparency International.

   Israeli troops kill four in Gaza

   Bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Rafah
   The bodies were riddled with bullets

   Israeli troops have killed four Palestinians near the town of Rafah in
   the southern Gaza Strip.

   The Israeli military said they were trying to cross from Gaza into
   Egypt overnight and were suspected of being militants or weapons
   smugglers.

   Reports are coming in of a Palestinian car exploding on the road
   between Rafah and Khan Younis.

   The cause of the explosion is not yet known. Witnesses say an Israeli
   unmanned aircraft had been in the area.

   At least three members of militant umbrella group called the Popular
   Resistance Committees were wounded in the blast, reports say.

   Israeli troops opened fire at the group of Palestinians near the border
   at about midnight. Three bodies were recovered soon afterwards and a
   fourth was recovered at daybreak, sources said.

   It is not yet known if the dead men were members of any Palestinian
   militant group.

   Palestinian militants have been waging a four-year intifada or uprising
   against Israel, whose forces have occupied the Gaza Strip and West Bank
   since 1967.

   Kumble overtakes Kapil's record
   First Test, Dhaka, day one (stumps):
   Bangladesh 184 all out v India
   Match scorecard

   Kumble broke the Indian record in his 91st Test for his country Kumble
   broke the Indian record in his 91st Test for his country

   Anil Kumble took the 435th wicket of his Test match career to set a new
   Indian record on the first day of the first Test against Bangladesh.

   Kumble overtook the mark set by Kapil Dev when he had Mohammad Rafique
   lbw.

   And he followed up with a wicket next ball before Bangladesh were
   bowled out for 184 in 58 overs in Dhaka.

   After the first session was lost to rain, Irfan Pathan took five
   wickets to reduce the hosts to 106-7 before Mohammad Ashraful dug in.

   Ashraful ended unbeaten on 60, having hit six fours and faced 135
   balls.

   Congratulations to one of the most dedicated cricketers to represent
   the country

   Kumble had a chance of a hat-trick after removing Tapash Baisya via a
   catch at first slip but Mashrafe Mortaza safely defended the fifth ball
   of his 12th over.

   But a run out ended the innings not long afterwards.

   India did not get chance to begin their reply as openers Virender
   Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were immediately offered the light on
   stepping to the wicket.

   India won the toss and Pathan soon got stuck into the top order,
   dismissing Javed Omar lbw in his second over with one that nipped back.

   I Pathan
   Pathan was in destructive mood on Friday at the Bangabandhu

   Nafis Iqbal and Rajin Saleh were also ajudged lbw by umpire Jeremy
   Lloyds off consecutive balls in Pathan's fifth over.

   Captain Habibul Bashar then pulled Zaheer Khan straight to square leg
   and when the same bowler had Khaled Mashud caught behind, Bangladesh
   were 50-5 after just 16 overs.

   Ashraful, largely in partnership with Rafique (47), did his best to
   build a recovery but India will expect to amass a huge lead on
   Saturday.

   Kumble is now fifth in the all-time list. Aged 34, he may still be able
   to reach the 500-mark, passed by only three men.

   Fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne tops the list with 552 wickets.

   "I am delighted with this landmark achievement," Kumble, who has a Test
   average of 28.15, said. said.

   Day 1 reaction: Kumble thrilled

   "I always wanted to give my hundred percent and I played well this
   season."

   'Little hope' for Alaska sailors

   The Selendang Ayu freighter has split in two
   Both pieces of the freighter are grounded upright

   The US Coast Guard has called off a search for six missing crew of a
   tanker which ran aground and split in half on Wednesday off the coast
   of Alaska.

   A statement said there was little hope survivors would be found given
   the icy water temperature and the type of clothes the men were wearing.

   Attention now turns to thousands of gallons of oil which have leaked
   from the ship near Unalaska Island.

   Environmentalists warn the spill could have a disastrous impact on
   wildlife.

   The area where the spill happened is a sensitive habitat for mammals
   and birds, and also a crab fishery.

   "It's a serious spill, it's going to be very difficult to deal with,"
   said Kurt Fredriksson, from the Alaska Department of Environmental
   Conservation.

   Bering Sea map

   The Coast Guard is standing by with oil containment equipment near the
   site of the spill.

   A 40-member response team has been assembled in Dutch Harbor, on the
   other side of the island.

   But the team needs a break in the weather to start the clean-up, and
   winds appeared to be strengthening.

   Wildlife in the area include several endangered or threatened species
   including Steller sea lions and Steller's eiders.

   The area is also home to western Alaska sea otters whose population has
   dropped to low levels.

   The spill, though much smaller, is being compared to the Exxon Valdez
   disaster in 1989 when 11 million gallons spilled near a remote wildlife
   haven.

   Search hampered

   The six members of the tanker's crew plunged into the sea when a US
   Coast Guard helicopter crashed while evacuating them from the
   freighter.

   Four other people, including three coast guard members, were
   rescued.The cause of Wednesday's helicopter crash is still unknown.

   The search for the missing crew had been hampered by strong winds,
   heavy seas and the shortage of daylight in the area, 1,300km (800
   miles) south-west of Anchorage.

   The missing crew members were reported to be from India and the
   Philippines.

   Survival time in the cold, heavy seas was estimated to be just three
   hours.

   But coast guards said there was a slim chance some of them could have
   got ashore.

   The 40,000-tonne Malaysian-flagged Selendang Ayu broke in two after
   running aground in the Aleutian chain of islands off south-western
   Alaska.

   It had been drifting after its main engine broke down on Tuesday.

   The ship was carrying soya beans and around 480,000 gallons (2.3
   million litres) of fuel oil.

   Indonesia's Golkar to elect leader

   Indonesian vice-president Jusuf Kalla
   The Indonesian leadership would welcome a Kalla win

   Indonesia's largest political party is meeting on Thursday on the
   island resort of Bali to elect its next leader at a critical time in
   its history.

   Incumbent party boss Akbar Tandjung and Indonesia's Vice-President
   Jusuf Kalla are the main contenders.

   Golkar, which has the most number of MPs, is the main opposition party
   and still wields considerable power.

   But the meeting was clouded by reports that traces of the poison
   arsenic were found in a soup meant for Mr Kalla.

   Mr Kalla's security guards are said to have detected the poison.

   It is the second suspected case of arsenic in Indonesian politics in
   recent months.

   A prominent human rights activist, Munir, died on a flight to Amsterdam
   in September.

   Time for change

   The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Jakarta says a Kalla win would bring the
   party closer to government and boost its ability to push through its
   agenda.

   For more than three decades Golkar was the political machine which
   helped to keep former President Suharto in power, she says.

   The party's candidate for this year's presidential election failed to
   make it past the first round, but it is still the largest party in
   parliament and as such Golkar wields significant influence.

   Now in a new twist to the leadership race, Indonesia's vice-president
   has thrown his hat into the ring.

   Officially there are six candidates in the contest to become leader of
   Indonesia's most powerful political party, but the focus is on the two
   leading contenders, current leader Mr Tandjung and Mr Kalla.

   Mr Tandjung enjoys strong grass roots support and he has won praise for
   steering the party through the turbulent years which followed the fall
   of President Suharto.

   He also managed to survive a corruption conviction which was overturned
   on appeal earlier this year.

   But the party failed in the presidential contest and some Golkar
   insiders now feel it is time for a change.

   Mr Kalla offers a powerful alternative. Despite his decision to run for
   vice-president against the official Golkar ticket, Mr Kalla has
   retained an influential position within the party.

   A win for Mr Kalla would swing the party towards the government. That
   could have a profound impact on the government's ability to implement
   its programme.

   There is a lot more than just the party leadership riding on the
   outcome of this race.

   'Italian hostage killed' in Iraq

   Gunmen pose over body
   Gunmen said the body in the desert was that of an Italian photographer

   Gunmen in Iraq claim to have shot dead an Italian photographer they had
   taken hostage, reports say.

   A blindfolded body - purportedly that of 52-year-old Salvatore Santoro
   - was shown to a group of Iraqi journalists in the desert near the town
   of Ramadi.

   The militants who led the journalists to the body also showed them a
   passport and documents in Mr Santoro's name.

   Mr Santoro is believed to have been a resident of the UK. Officials in
   Rome and London cannot confirm the reports.

   Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said reports of Mr Santoro's
   killing should be treated with caution.

   The blindfold on the body seen in pictures taken by the Iraqi
   journalists made it difficult to identify the man, Mr Fini said.

   According to the Associated Press news agency, the journalists were led
   to the body by a group of militants that stopped them at a checkpoint
   near Ramadi in central Iraq.

   The gunmen told them the Italian photographer was taken prisoner after
   he tried to drive through an insurgent roadblock, crashed his vehicle
   and killed one of their group.

   Separate footage obtained by Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera shows a group
   claiming to be the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Mujahideen posing with
   documents apparently taken from the slain man.

   There are conflicting reports over why Mr Santoro may have been in
   Iraq.

   Targets

   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been a vocal supporter of
   the US-led campaign in the country.

   Several Italians have been among the foreigners taken hostage by Iraqi
   militants.

   Seven of them have been killed, including the journalist Enzo Baldoni
   and a security guard, Fabrizio Quattrochi.

   Two Italian women working as aid workers in Baghdad were released after
   weeks in captivity earlier this year.

   Bugging device found in UN room

   UN headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland
   The room was used by ministers and heads of delegations

   The United Nations says it has found a bugging device in a room at its
   European offices in Geneva.

   The revelation, first made on Swiss television, was confirmed in a
   statement by a UN spokeswoman.

   She said the device was found recently during repairs to the French
   Hall, often used for video conferences with the UN headquarters in New
   York.

   The room is reported to have been used by ministers from major powers
   last year during private talks on Iraq.

   Older device

   The UN spokeswoman, Marie Heuze, said an inquiry had failed to
   determine who planted the device.

   A Geneva-based security expert who saw photos of the device told
   Television Suisse Romande that the system appeared to be of Russian or
   Eastern European origin.

   "It's a very sophisticated piece of listening equipment where the sound
   is picked up and immediately retransmitted," Surveillance Consulting
   Group head Patrick Daniel Eugster said, according to the Associated
   Press news agency.

   Its size indicated it was three or four years old, he added.

   There have been allegations in the past that senior UN officials were
   bugged during the run-up to the Iraq war by countries such as Britain
   and the United States.

Missing Munitions Become Focus of Presidential Race

   By Dana Milbank and Jim VandeHei
   Washington Post Staff Writers
   Thursday, October 28, 2004; Page A01

   LITITZ, Pa., Oct. 27 -- The disappearance of nearly 400 tons of
   explosives in Iraq dominated the presidential race for a third straight
   day on Wednesday, as Democratic nominee John F. Kerry accused President
   Bush of evading responsibility and the Republican said Kerry was making
   unsubstantiated charges.

   Kerry, traveling in Iowa, scrapped plans to talk about domestic policy
   to accuse Bush of trying to cover up the failure to secure the
   explosives in Iraq. "This is a growing scandal and the American people
   deserve a full and honest explanation of how it happened and what the
   president is going to do about it," Kerry told supporters in Sioux
   City. Instead, he said, "we're seeing this White House dodging and
   bobbing and weaving . . . just as they've done each step of the way in
   our involvement in Iraq."
   Bush's team includes Deputy Chief of Staff Joseph W. Hagin, adviser
   Karl Rove and deputy national security adviser Stephen J. Hadley.

   Bush, breaking two days of silence on the issue, told supporters at a
   rally here that Kerry was making "wild charges" about the missing
   munitions and was "denigrating the action of our troops and commanders
   in the field without knowing the facts."

   "Our military is now investigating a number of possible scenarios,
   including that the explosives may have been moved before our troops
   even arrived at the site," Bush said, adding: "A political candidate
   who jumps to conclusions without knowing the facts is not a person you
   want as your commander in chief."

   That Bush addressed the issue at all -- on Tuesday he only glared at a
   reporter who inquired about the matter -- reflected the prominence the
   explosives have gained in the final days of the presidential race, when
   every moment is precious to the campaigns. Kerry has used the situation
   to question Bush's terrorism-fighting credentials, and the matter has
   crowded out the subjects Bush is raising, particularly an appeal to
   Democrats.

   The candidates' dispute centers on when the munitions disappeared from
   an Iraqi weapons depot -- before or after Saddam Hussein's fall from
   power last year. Details about which U.S. troops were among the first
   to reach the depot and what they did there have dribbled out of the
   Pentagon.

   On Wednesday, the Pentagon said members of the 3rd Infantry and 101st
   Airborne divisions stopped there in early April 2003 but pushed on to
   Baghdad without hunting for the explosives. The first designated search
   teams, members of the 75th Exploitation Task Force, surveyed the depot
   on May 8, 11 and 27 in 2003 but found none of the explosives in
   question, the Pentagon said.

   While there has yet to be an "October surprise" that shakes up the
   race, a series of small, negative surprises have undermined Bush's
   campaign: the flu-vaccine shortage, climbing oil prices, falling stocks
   and this month's disappointing jobs report.

   On Tuesday, Iraqi interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi accused the
   U.S.-led forces in Iraq of "gross negligence" in allowing the massacre
   of 49 Iraqi guardsmen by insurgents. That followed the news Monday that
   the International Atomic Energy Agency had told the Bush administration
   on Oct. 15 that about 380 tons of powerful explosives had vanished from
   the depot.

   Recently, Kerry has jumped from bad headline to bad headline to
   calibrate his attacks on Bush. For the most part, he is making this
   race a mandate on Bush measured by public reports and statistics,
   relegating his own ideas largely to the closing moments of 40-minute
   speeches. Kerry aides privately acknowledge that the Democrat has not
   captured the imagination of many voters. But they argue that he has
   successfully presented himself as an acceptable alternative to Bush.

   While the bad news does not necessarily translate into support for the
   challenger, a survey of swing voters released Wednesday by the
   nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that Kerry "has made more
   substantial gains among these swing voters in the past month." Pew
   reported that the number of swing voters leaning toward Kerry increased
   to 40 percent from 28 percent, while the number supporting Bush
   increased to 38 percent from 34 percent.

   To quiet audiences on Wednesday, Bush sought to use the missing
   munitions to his advantage by suggesting their existence, though
   conventional, confirmed the case for war. "After repeatedly calling
   Iraq the 'wrong war' and a 'diversion,' Senator Kerry this week seemed
   shocked to learn that Iraq was a dangerous place full of dangerous
   weapons," he told supporters. "The senator used to know that, even
   though he seems to have forgotten it over the course of the campaign.
   But after all, that's why we're there."

   Bush said U.S.-led forces have destroyed or captured more than 400,000
   tons of munitions, and he pointed to remarks by Kerry foreign policy
   adviser Richard C. Holbrooke. "Now the senator is making wild charges
   about missing explosives when his top foreign policy adviser admits,
   quote, 'We do not know the facts,' " he said. "Think about that. The
   senator's denigrating the action of our troops and commanders in the
   field without knowing the facts."

   Aides said Bush was referring to an interview Holbrooke gave Fox News
   on Tuesday in which he said: "The U.N. inspectors and the IAEA
   inspectors had told the American military this was a major depot. . . .
   Now the thing has been looted. I don't know what happened. I do know
   one thing: In most administrations, the buck stops in the Oval Office."

Retired Army General Is Sworn In as Indonesian President

   By Alan Sipress
   Washington Post Foreign Service
   Thursday, October 21, 2004; Page A21

   JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 20 -- A retired army general who holds a
   doctorate in economics was sworn in Wednesday as Indonesia's first
   directly elected president and announced a cabinet that reflected his
   style as a cautious reformer.

   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was elected by a landslide one month ago,
   defeating President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Yudhoyono, 55, begins his
   five-year term with public expectations running high that he will bring
   stability to a country that has had four presidents since the longtime
   dictator, Suharto, was ousted after protests in 1998.
   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said he would focus of domestic issues.

   "I have to remind you all that the complicated and complex problems of
   the nation cannot be solved within the period of a hundred days. It is
   not as easy as turning over the palm of your hand," Yudhoyono said in
   his inaugural speech at the presidential palace. "But I'm convinced
   that our determination and good intentions are more powerful than the
   problems we face."

   He said he would focus on domestic affairs, cataloguing challenges from
   unemployment and corruption to terrorism and separatist conflicts in
   the outlying provinces of Aceh and Papua.

   Yudhoyono also singled out the rising price of oil, which could
   represent an early test for his administration. Government subsidies
   have increased in recent months to maintain artificially low consumer
   fuel prices, and Yudhoyono must soon decide whether to cut the popular
   subsidies or risk wrecking the national budget.

   Earlier in the day, appearing at parliament wearing a blue suit and
   traditional black Muslim cap, he read the oath of office from a brown
   batik folder, as a religious leader held a copy of the Koran, the
   Muslim holy book, above his head. Outside, more than 2,000 police
   officers stood guard.

   Security forces in Jakarta have been on alert since the August 2003
   bombing of the JW Marriott Hotel, which killed 12 people. Last month, a
   truck bombing outside the Australian Embassy killed nine people. Both
   attacks were blamed on Muslim extremists.

   Yudhoyono's inauguration as the leader of the world's largest Muslim
   nation drew lawmakers, judges, ministers, diplomats and the leaders of
   five neighboring countries. Megawati did not attend, and reportedly
   spent the morning gardening at her home in the south of the capital.

   Most of the cabinet ministers named by Yudhoyono were described as
   advocating measured changes in the country.

   "He wants reform, not a big bang, but a systematic and gradualist
   approach. That's the message from his cabinet appointments," said
   Bambang Harymurti, editor of Tempo, a weekly magazine.

   The post of attorney general has drawn the most public interest because
   it is central to fighting graft in a country that was ranked by
   Transparency International, which analyzes government openness, as
   among the most corrupt in the world. Yudhoyono gave the job to Abdul
   Rahman Saleh, a Supreme Court justice who cast the only dissenting vote
   this year when a five-judge panel cleared the former parliament speaker
   of graft charges. But several analysts said they were waiting to see
   whether Saleh's courage extends to tackling the many vested interests
   that benefit from Indonesia's corrupt legal system.

   For chief security minister, Yudhoyono named retired Adm. Widodo
   Adisutjipto, a former armed forces commander, who will have significant
   influence in military affairs. He will face demands from activists and
   some lawmakers to reform the powerful armed forces by placing the
   military under civilian control and restricting its role in politics
   and business.

   Yudhoyono's chief economics minister will be Aburizal Bakrie, a
   businessman and former head of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce who
   has close ties to the Golkar party of former president Suharto. Jusuf
   Anwar, an Asian Development Bank director, will become finance
   minister.

   The new administration will seek to reinvigorate the economy, which is
   growing too slowly to accommodate the estimated 40 percent of the
   workforce now either jobless or underemployed.

   Yudhoyono is expected to play a central role in economic policy. Days
   after his election victory, he received an economics doctorate from the
   Bogor Institute of Agriculture, having written a dissertation on the
   role of agricultural development in alleviating poverty.

   World leaders mourn death of Arafat [typk.jpg]

   Special report: Concern mounts over Yasser Arafat's health

       BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhuanet) -- World leaders on Thursday expressed
   their condolences over the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
   who died earlier in the day at a French military hospital outside Paris
   after battling his illness for more than two weeks.

       Chinese President Hu Jintao sent a letter of condolences to Rawhi
   Fattuh, speaker of the Palestine Legislative Council, on Arafat's
   death.

       "His passing away was a great loss for Palestinians," Hu said. "The
   Chinese people has lost a great friend."

       Hu hailed Arafat as a great leader and an outstanding politician
   who had dedicated his whole life to the just cause of regaining the
   lawful right of the Palestinian people. Arafat enjoys profound respect
   among the Palestinian people and great prestige in the international
   community, Hu added.

       Hu expressed the conviction that the Palestinian government
   andpeople will carry forward Arafat's uncompleted causes, continue to
   advance the peace process in the Middle East, and exert unremitting
   efforts to resolve the Middle East issue through political means.

       China stands ready to work with the Palestinian side to further
   boost friendly relations, the Chinese president said.

                             the hands of God."

       French President Jacques Chirac said in a statement that "it is
   with emotion that I have just learnt of the death of President Yasser
   Arafat." "I offer my very sincere condolences to his family and to
   people close to him."

       "To the Palestinian people, I want to express at this moment of
   mourning the friendship of France and the French people."

       Arafat was "the man of courage and conviction," who had embodied
   the Palestinian struggle for statehood for the past four decades,
   Chirac said.

       "Firmly and with conviction," France will maintain its commitment
   to two states that live side by side in peace and security, the
   statement said.

       The French government is holding an emergency ministers' meeting to
   discuss the transportation of Arafat's body to Cairo, where a funeral
   is to be held on Friday. After the memorial service, Arafat will be
   laid down to rest at his headquarters in the West Bank city of
   Ramallah.

       A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the UN chief
   was "deeply moved to learn of the death of President Yasser Arafat."

       "For nearly four decades, he expressed and symbolized in person the
   national aspirations of the Palestinian people," the spokesmansaid.

       Annan urged both Israelis and Palestinians as well as friends of
   both peoples to "make even greater efforts to bring about the peaceful
   realization of the Palestinian right of self-determination."

       US President George W. Bush also expressed condolences over
   Arafat's death.

       "The death of Yasser Arafat is a significant moment in Palestinian
   history. We express our condolences to the Palestinian people," Bush
   said in a statement.

       "For the Palestinian people, we hope that the future will bring
   peace and the fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent,
   democratic Palestine that is at peace with its neighbors," the
   statement said.

       The US government urges "all in the region and throughout the world
   to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the
   ultimate goal of peace," Bush said.

       Spokesman for the Arab League Hossam Zaki said Arafat's death is "a
   great loss, not only to the Palestinian cause but to the Arab world."

       "Arafat was the embodiment of the Palestinian question and his
   absence will certainly be greatly felt," Zaki said.

       New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff said Arafat "symbolized
   Palestinians' long search for statehood and independence."

       "His achievement was to win acknowledgment for the existence of the
   Palestinian nation and to advocate for the rights of a dispossessed and
   disadvantaged people," Goff said in a statement.

       In Indonesia, a government spokesman hailed Arafat as a "hero to us
   all."

       "He was the ultimate embodiment of decades of the just struggle of
   a nation for its undeniable rights to self determination," Foreign
   Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa said.

       Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called Arafat "a pioneer
   who had laid out the foundation for the establishment of a Palestinian
   state."

       "I sincerely hope the Palestinians overcome their sorrow and
   continue with their effort toward achieving peace and prosperity in the
   region," Koizumi said in a statement. Enditem

          DHAKA, Nov. 12 (Xinhuanet) -- Bangladeshi President Iajuddin
     Ahmedhas left for Cairo to attend the funeral of Palestinian leader
    Yasser Arafat who died Thursday in Paris, the Daily Star reported on
                                   Friday.

         The Bangladeshi government announced a three-day mourning since
       Thursday night to pay respect to the late founder of Palestine
     Liberation Organization (PLO) and President of the Palestine State.

       Bangladesh's national flag is flying at half-mast in all important
        public and private buildings and Bangladesh missions abroad.

        Meanwhile, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum Khaleda, who is nowin
    Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah Haj, Thursday termed Yasser Arafat as a
         trusted friend of Bangladesh in her message of condolences.

         Chief of the main opposition Awami League Sheikh Hasina in her
    message also expressed deep grief at the death of Arafat, saying his
    sacrifice, struggle and courage for the cause of Palestinian autonomy
                     would always be etched on history.

          Former diplomats and other opposition leaders, who witnessed
   Arafat's rapport with Bangladeshi leaders since 1971, said the lasting
    relationship between Arafat and all the leaders of Bangladesh was in
    fact a symbol of solidarity and friendship between the two peoples of
     the two countries. Although Arafat's death marks the end of an era,
     Bangladesh will not and should not cease supporting the Palestinian
               struggle for independent statehood, added them.

       Mohammad Zamir, a former Bangladeshi ambassador who met Arafat over
   150 times, was quoted as saying that Bangladesh's foreign ministry and
     its permanent representative in the United Nations should initiate
       steps to push for holding a free and fair electionin Palestine,
    especially in the Israel-occupied cities and towns in the West Bank.

           The Palestinian embassy in Dhaka Thursday opened a book of
    condolences. President Iajuddin Ahmed Thursday signed the book before
                             leaving for Cairo.

        Palestinian Ambassador in Dhaka Shahta Zarab was quoted as saying
     that Arafat had a special place in his heart for Bangladesh and its
   people, as whenever he traveled to anywhere in Asia he tried to make a
                           stopover in Bangladesh.

       Meanwhile, hundreds of political and civil society organizations of
   the country Thursday issued messages of condolences, terming the death
      of Arafat as a great loss to the oppressed of the world. Enditem

       BEIJING, Nov. 15 (Xinhuanet) -- The secretary of the Iranian
   Supreme National Security Council, Hassan Rowhani, says Tehran has
   agreed to suspend activities relating to uranium enrichment.

       Rowhani's announcement followed two days of talks with French,
   German and British ambassadors in Tehran. It's also reported that the
   International Atomic Energy Agency has received an official statement
   to this effect, reported CCTV on Monday.

       Hossein Moussavian, a top Iranian security official, said the
   suspension would take effect while negotiations continue with the EU.

       The IAEA will meet at the end of the month to discuss the
   situation. If Iran fails to clarify the purpose of its nuclear
   research, the agency could refer the matter to the UN Security Council,
   which, in turn, may impose harsh sanctions.

       BEIJING, Nov. 16 (Xinhuanet) -- France says the medical files of
   former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat can be released upon demand to
   eligible parties, such as his family.

       French defence ministry spokesman Jean-Francois Bureau said on
   Monday that if the eligible parties ask for Arafat's file to be
   transferred, the law, which also applies to military doctors, says the
   medical file should be released.

       Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei has asked France to provide
   him with a medical report detailing the cause of Arafat's death.

       Arafat died in a French military hospital last Thursday at the age
   of 75 after sinking into a coma, but no information has been released
   about the exact cause of death.

       BEIJING, Nov. 29 (Xinhuanet) -- Near 100 whales and dolphines have
   commited mysterious "mass beaching suicide" from last week on
   Australia's south coast.

       According to the reports of Monday's AFP, a second pod of 17 whales
   has died on King Island between the Australian mainland and the
   country's island state of Tasmania. Last weekend, a fatal stranding had
   caused the death of about 80.

       The number of deaths on King Island could be higher as some bodies
   might have been washed back out to sea, said Warwick Brennan, a
   spokesman for Tasmania's Department of Primary Industry, Water and
   Environment.

       Rescuers were rushing to the area to drag by all means the mammals
   back to sea.

       According to Brennan, the success of the rescue operation would
   depend on the condition of the animals and the depth of the water.

       No one knows exactly why the mammals are stranding themselves.
   Scientists have been on their way to King Island to help with
   postmortems as part of the process of trying to discover a reason.

       These stranding mammals were first noticed by the local people. And
   they immediately pitched in to try to save them.

       The deaths come a year after 100 pilot whales died on a remote
   beach on the southwest coast of Tasmania. Enditem

   US launches offensive operation in Afghanistan
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-11 16:13:54

       KABUL, Dec. 11 (Xinhuanet) -- The US-led coalition has launched a
   winter offensive against Taliban militias, US military spokesman said
   Saturday.

   "Operation Lightening Freedom has begun and would continue till the
   parliamentary election is held," Mark McCann told reporters here.

       He declined to give the exact date when the operation began.
   However, he described the primary objective of the operation as
   ensuring security during the upcoming legislative elections slated for
   next April.

       Remnants of the former Taliban regime who failed to disrupt the
   landmark Oct. 9 presidential polls or presidential inauguration last
   Tuesday have vowed to continue Jihad or holy war till the US-dominated
   foreign troops leave Afghanistan.

       The US military has conducted a series of operations against the
   Taliban militias and their al-Qaeda allies for the last two years, of
   which the prominent Operation Anaconda and Operation Mountain Storm
   failed to stamp out the insurgents. Enditem

   Pakistani police arrest 11 suspects for Quetta blast
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-11 20:25:35

       ISLAMABAD, Dec. 11 (Xinhuanet) -- The Pakistani police have
   arrested over 11 suspects to be involved in the bomb blast on Friday in
   Quetta, capital of the southwestern Baluchistan province, which killed
   11 persons including two soldiers, said a senior police officer
   Saturday.

       "We have taken into custody more than eleven suspects in overnight
   raids," Pervez Bhatti, deputy inspector general of Baluchistan Police,
   told reporters in Quetta.

       The preliminary investigation revealed that a new terrorist group
   was behind the attack, Bhatti said without naming it.

       Local reports said Saturday that a little known group, the
   Balochistan Liberation Army, has claimed of carrying out the attack.
   Azad Baluch, spokesman for the group, was quoted as saying the group
   had targeted a military truck "to express our anger."

       Bhatti said suspects have been arrested all over the province on
   the information received from the intelligence agencies and the
   terrorists of a new organization are targeting police in the checkposts
   outside urban areas.

       They are now doing terrorist activities inside the city, he added.

       Security has deteriorated in Balochistan in the past year and
   reports say that there have been more than 30 bomb attacks in Quetta,
   but none have been as deadly as the Friday's blast.

       The blast killed 11 people including two armymen and wounded more
   than 20 others. It also wrecked several vehicles including a military
   truck and smashed glasses of the nearby shops. Enditem

              France races against clock in Iraq hostage crisis
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-08-30 21:14

      France scrambled to secure the freedom of two French journalists
     kidnapped by Iraqi militants who gave Paris until Monday evening to
        drop its controversial ban on Muslim headscarves in schools.

   French President Jacques Chirac, in a televised address in Paris on
   August 29, 2004, urges Islamic militants to release French journalists
   they were holding in Iraq. [Reuters]

     French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, in Egypt at the start of a
   Middle East tour to appeal for regional help, made an impassioned plea
      to the Islamic Army in Iraq holding Christian Chesnot and Georges
                                 Malbrunot.

    The militant group, which last week said it killed Italian journalist
    Enzo Baldoni, Saturday gave the French government 48 hours to rescind
       the headscarf ban, without saying what would happen to the two
                       Frenchmen if it did not comply.

   "I call for their release in the name of the principles of humanity and
   respect for human beings which are at the very heart of the message of
     Islam and Muslim religious practice," Barnier told reporters at the
                          French embassy in Cairo.

   The crisis over the French journalists stunned France which won Russian
    and German support last year in its high-profile campaign against the
    U.S.-led war in Iraq and because of this considered itself safe from
                              militant attack.

      "Their kidnapping is incomprehensible to all those who know that
    France, the country of origin of human rights, is a land of tolerance
     and of respect for others," Barnier said before seeing Arab League
      chief Amr Moussa and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit.

    "France has always opposed the vision of a clash between the West and
       Islam," said Barnier, who along with other French officials was
   entrusted with trying to secure the journalists' release. The minister
                   did not give other details of his trip.

    Chesnot of Radio France Internationale and Malbrunot, who writes for
   the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest France, disappeared on Aug. 20 on their
     way from Baghdad to Najaf, the day after Baldoni was taken hostage.

                        CRISIS DRAGS FRANCE INTO IRAQ

    "France, due to its position on the war in Iraq, could have hoped it
     was safe," Le Figaro said in an editorial Monday. "This was not the
                                   case."

   President Jacques Chirac, who sent Barnier to the Middle East and made
     a televised appeal for the journalists' release, postponed Monday's
      talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor
                             Gerhard Schroeder.

      The Foreign Ministry said its secretary-general, Hubert Colin de
     Verdiere, left for Baghdad Sunday night for separate talks aimed at
                       securing the hostages' release.

     Diplomats in Iraq said that, while Barnier's Middle East trip was a
     very public response to the kidnappings, private contacts with the
     kidnappers could be the most effective way of trying to secure the
                       release of the two journalists.

    Most countries that have had citizens taken hostage in Iraq have used
   Iraqi intermediaries to try to contact kidnap groups and open a channel
                              for negotiations.

        Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab world's largest Islamist
     organization but officially banned in Egypt, said in a statement it
                         condemned the kidnappings.

   "The Muslim Brotherhood demands the two French journalists kidnapped in
   Iraq be freed, especially as there is no proof of their involvement in
        any activity against the law and order, but rather they were
   participating in exposing the occupation and its practices," the group
                                    said.

                      FRANCE UNITES AGAINST KIDNAPPERS

      French critics and defenders of the ban on Muslim headscarves in
     schools united in support of the law Monday, pledging to stand firm
                           against the kidnappers.

    Representatives of France's five-million strong Muslim community, the
   largest in Europe, have denied any link with the militant Islamic Army
                                  in Iraq.

   Fouad Alaoui, secretary general of an Islamic group that had previously
   urged schoolgirls to defy the French headscarf ban, recommended Monday
               that they refrain from openly flouting the law.

       "This episode must not lead to a further radicalization of the
                situation in France," Alaoui told RTL radio.

   A group of Arab intellectuals called for a demonstration of support for
                the journalists at RFI's headquarters Monday.

   France passed the law in March in reaction to the growing influence of
     Islamist activists and tensions between Muslim and Jewish youths in
      schools. The law also banned Jewish skullcaps and large Christian
                                  crosses.

    It was widely condemned as a flagrant breach of religious freedom, in
    countries such as the United States and Britain as well as across the
                                Muslim world.

   The French government, which rejected the criticism, said there was no
                     question of the law being revoked.

     "It will be applied," government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope told
                           Canal Plus television.

                         Hostages face death in Iraq
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-09-20 09:59

   Several insurgent groups set deadlines for killing more than a score of
    hostages in Iraq -- from a trio of American and British workers to an
    entire squad of 18 Iraqi soldiers -- unless their various demands are
                                    met.

     One militant group threatened to kill two Americans and a Briton on
   Monday unless women prisoners were freed, and another group threatened
   to kill 10 workers from a U.S.-Turkish firm if their company failed to
                    leave the country within three days.

    The wave of hostage-taking spread to Iraq's security forces, with an
   Islamist group saying it would kill 18 soldiers unless authorities free
    an aide to Shi'ite rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr within 48 hours, Arab
                    television Al Jazeera said on Sunday.

   It showed a video of masked gunmen and a group of uniformed men it said
    were 18 members of the fledgling National Guard, which has come under
    fierce attack from insurgents who see them as collaborators with the
                         U.S.-led occupying forces.

   The kidnappers were demanding the release of Sadr aide Hazem al-Araji,
     also a Shi'ite Muslim cleric. Sadr supporters in Baghdad said U.S.
                forces seized Araji overnight in the capital.

    Much of the kidnapping of foreigners seen in the past few months has
     been in the minority Sunni Muslim heartlands, where U.S. and Iraqi
              officials say foreign Islamists are also active.

    Many of dozens of hostages have been freed over the months, some have
    died. An Islamist group said it had beheaded three non-Arab Kurds who
    were members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which cooperates with
                       Iraq's U.S.-backed government.

   An Internet video from the Army of Ansar al-Sunna appeared to show the
     heads of three young men being severed and placed on their bodies.

   Lawlessness in the last two weeks has claimed the lives of hundreds of
    people and raised doubts that elections scheduled for January will go
                                   ahead.

                                Election vow

   But Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said on Sunday the elections will
              be held in January despite the surge in violence.

     Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair (R) meets Iraq's interim Prime
     Minister Iyad Allawi in Downing Street, London September 19, 2004.
      Allawi insisted on Sunday that elections in Iraq will go ahead in
                        January as planned. [Reuters]
     "We definitely are going to stick to the timetable of elections in
   January next year," Allawi told a news conference after talks in London
                   with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

   The abduction of Westerners has forced many foreign firms to scale back
   their operations or pull out, hindering efforts to rebuild the country
                    after the ousting of Saddam Hussein.

        Blair and Allawi said they were working to resolve the latest
                                kidnappings.

    The British Foreign Office appealed on Al Arabiya television for any
              information from Iraqis on Briton Kenneth Bigley.

    "We implore anyone with information which may help us free Kenneth to
    contact us and we will not reveal their identity," a British Foreign
                       Office official said in Arabic.

    Bigley's brother, Phillip, appealed to the kidnappers on Al Arabiya,
      saying: "Ken is a loving and caring father ... and he is looking
     forward to becoming a grandfather for the first time in February."

   He added: "At the end of the day, we just want him home, safe and well,
                         especially for my mother."

                                Death threat

     The two Americans and Bigley, seized from their home in Baghdad on
                 Thursday, work for an engineering company.

    Internet video footage showed the hostages and a gunman who said the
     Tawhid and Jihad group led by Jordanian suspected al Qaeda ally Abu
     Musab al-Zarqawi would kill them unless Iraqi women prisoners were
                  freed from Abu Ghraib and Umm Qasr jails.

     The deadline expires on Monday morning, measured from the time the
                           footage first appeared.

         The U.S. military said no women were held at either prison.

   Only two women are publicly acknowledged to be in U.S. custody in Iraq.
      Dubbed "Dr Germ" and "Mrs Anthrax" by U.S. forces, they have been
   accused of working on weapons programs for toppled Iraqi leader Saddam
                                  Hussein.

          The women are held in a camp for high-ranking detainees.

      Washington has identified ally Zarqawi as its top target in Iraq,
                  putting a $25 million bounty on his head.

   He and his group have claimed responsibility for many of the bloodiest
    attacks. In May, the group released video footage of the beheading of
                    U.S. civilian hostage Nicholas Berg.

    There was no firm word on the fate of two French journalists and two
   Italian women aid workers being held. An unconfirmed report on Saturday
   said the Frenchmen were no longer captives but had agreed to spend some
      time with the group that seized them to report on its activities.

   In Rome, an Italian aid group on Sunday sent a video montage of emotive
   images to Arab television of the two Italians and two Iraqi colleagues
                    in the hope of winning their release.

                "I love Iraq," said hostage Simona Torretta.

                              Bombing campaign

     A car bomb on Sunday near the rebel stronghold of Samarra north of
   Baghdad killed an Iraqi soldier and wounded three U.S. troops, the U.S.
                               military said.

    A day earlier, a suicide car bomber killed at least 23 people queuing
      up for jobs with the Iraqi National Guard in the northern city of
                      Kirkuk, hospital officials said.

     Over the weekend in Baghdad, a car bomb killed two U.S. soldiers as
   they went to the scene of an earlier suspected suicide car bomb attack
                      that had wounded three soldiers.

                Musharraf: US must address root of terrorism
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-09-21 10:06

   The United States could lose its war on terrorism unless it deals with
        the poverty and political disputes that give rise to militant
   extremism, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said in an interview on
                                   Monday.

    "We are only involved at the moment in fighting terrorism frontally,
      the military perspective, the immediate response. But we are not
     addressing the root causes," Musharraf said in the interview on ABC
                                    News.

   sponsored by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the US-Pakistan
         Business Council in New York September 20, 2004. [Reuters]
       "I always say the root cause is political disputes, poverty and
   illiteracy," Musharraf said, adding that he does not think those issues
                            are being addressed.

     "I hope they are, otherwise we are not going to succeed. We may be
               winning battles, but we lose the war," he said.

     Poor and illiterate people who feel aggrieved because of political
    disputes are easy targets for indoctrination by militant groups, said
   Musharraf, who has played a pivotal role in the U.S.-led war on terror
           after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

      Musharraf named the Palestinian issue as the principal political
     dispute that must be addressed because he said it had "the maximum
             negative perspective" throughout the Muslim world.

   "There is unanimous sympathy for the Palestinians against the Israelis.
   And the United States is seen or perceived as an Israeli supporter and
    totally against Muslims," Musharraf said. "So I think this is the one
                  which needs to be resolved immediately."

    On the subject of his country's role in the ongoing hunt for al Qaeda
     militants and remnants of Afghanistan's toppled Taliban leadership,
          Musharraf described the Pakistani campaign as a success.

    "We have operated in south Pakistan, we have busted their sanctuaries
    from three valleys, so we are very successful. However, there may be
   more elsewhere," he said, adding that the military operation continues.

     Pakistani troops are engaged in an offensive in tribal regions just
   across the border from the southern Afghan provinces where U.S. troops
       are hunting al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his followers.

     The Pakistan leader said he had no idea where bin Laden was hiding.

     Musharraf spoke in New York where he will meet with U.S. President
     George W. Bush on the fringes of this week's U.N. General Assembly.

              Russia wins permanent military base in Tajikistan
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-17 09:34

    Tajikistan on Saturday formally granted Russian forces in the Central
      Asian state a permanent military base in a move Russian President
         Vladimir Putin hailed as a guarantee of regional security.

   With some 7,000 soldiers, Moscow said the 201 Divisions's headquarters
   in Tajikistan would be Russia's largest military base on foreign soil.

    Imomali Rakhmonov in Dushanbe, October 16, 2004. Putin has arrived in
   Tajikistan on an official visit and to attend a summit of leaders from
    the Central Asian Cooperation Organization, which groups Kazakhstan,
              Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. [Reuters]

              Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. [Reuters]
      "Our military presence in Tajikistan will not only guarantee our
   investment but will also guarantee stability in the region," Putin said
             after talks with Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov.

     At a joint news conference, Putin also announced deals to invest $2
                     billion in the former Soviet state.

   Russian forces were a stabilising factor in Tajikistan's 1992-97 civil
              war and a buffer against Taliban-run Afghanistan.

   But in past years Tajik officials openly said they wanted the Russians
      out to let Dushanbe, like other Central Asian neighbors, build on
    cooperation with the United States begun during the 2001 anti-Taliban
                      military campaign in Afghanistan.

   Tajikistan had dragged its feet on a 1999 pact granting the division a
    formal base, but promises of big investment and debt relief by Moscow
                                changed that.

     Criticized by nationalists for failing to defend its interests and
     presence in Central Asia, Russia has of late been keen to match the
                    growth of U.S. influence in the area.

    Last October, it opened a base in Central Asian Kyrgyzstan where NATO
                  established itself during the Afghan war.

   Tajikistan also on Saturday formally confirmed Russia's ownership of a
    space control center at Nurek, which was built in 1980 for the Soviet
                               space program.

    Between the 201 Division and its border guards in Tajikistan, Russia
                   has some 20,000 troops in the country.

     Rakhmonov and Putin reiterated an earlier agreement to relocate the
   guards, who hold 90 percent of the Tajik-Afghan border, from Tajikistan
                                  by 2006.

    That could weaken control over trafficking from Afghanistan, believed
             to account for 90 percent of drugs used in Europe.

    But the head of Russia's drugs control agency Viktor Cherkesov, said
        Moscow would work hard to counter that. "Our possibilities of
   discovering the channels of heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to the
     CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), to Russia, have seriously
                            increased," he said.

                   Sharon: Gaza plan only way to security
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-26 09:02

        Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon opened a stormy debate in
   parliament Monday with a passionate appeal to lawmakers to support his
     Gaza withdrawal plan which has divided the country and weakened his
            government as the only way to secure Israel's future.

   The withdrawal would mark the first time Israel has pulled down Jewish
    settlements in the West Bank or Gaza, and Sharon is hoping a decisive
   victory in a parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday will blunt calls
                   for a national referendum on the plan.

      Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon confers with an unidentified
   official during a special session in the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
      about his government's proposed 'disengagement plan' in Jerusalem
    Monday, Oct. 25, 2004. Sharon told the parliament he is determined to
    press ahead with his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and part of
    the West Bank, but remains open to peace talks with the Palestinians
     after their violent uprising ends. At left is Deputy Prime Minister
                              Ehud Olmert.[AP]

      about his government's proposed 'disengagement plan' in Jerusalem
    Monday, Oct. 25, 2004. Sharon told the parliament he is determined to
    press ahead with his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and part of
    the West Bank, but remains open to peace talks with the Palestinians
     after their violent uprising ends. At left is Deputy Prime Minister
                              Ehud Olmert.[AP]
    "This is a fateful moment for Israel. We are dealing with a difficult
      decision that has few parallels," he said in a speech repeatedly
              interrupted by heckling from hard-line opponents.

       The two-day debate in the Knesset is the climax of a monthslong
    confrontation over the "unilateral disengagement" plan, which Sharon
    has pushed despite strong opposition from much of his Likud Party and
         the threat that it could destroy his coalition government.

      As the debate began, violence flared in Gaza, with Israeli troops
    killing 15 Palestinians and wounding 91 others in a raid on the Khan
        Younis refugee camp to halt Palestinian mortar fire at nearby
               settlements. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded.

      Violence in Gaza has increased in recent months, with Palestinian
      militants trying to prove they are forcing Israel out, and Israel
     seeking to crush the militants to show it is not withdrawing under
                                    fire.

    Sharon says his plan to leave Gaza and pull down four small West Bank
    settlements is vital to ending four years of devastating violence in
    the region. Jewish settlers accuse Sharon of caving in to Palestinian
     violence and fear the withdrawal will be the first step in a larger
                                  pullback.

   Palestinians view the plan with skepticism and worry that Sharon hopes
   to use the limited withdrawal to mute international criticism of Israel
     and strengthen its hold over large parts of the West Bank and East
            Jerusalem, lands the Palestinians claim for a state.

   The program, which will uproot 8,800 settlers, is a sharp reversal for
    the premier, who was once the settlers' top patron in the government.
    Sharon said supporting the withdrawal was the most difficult decision
                             of his long career.

     "I know the significance of the Knesset's decision for thousands of
   Israelis who have lived for many years in the Gaza Strip, who were sent
   there in the name of Israeli governments, and built their homes there.
   Who planted flowers and trees, and brought up their children, who have
    never known another home," he said. "I know this well. I sent many."

   Sharon said his plan was not intended to replace negotiations with the
                        Palestinians in the long run.

    "It is a necessary step during a period in which negotiations are not
       possible. All is open when terror this murderous terror stops."

   The plan has sharply divided Sharon's Likud Party, with nearly half the
   40 Likud lawmakers saying they will vote against it, forcing Sharon to
              rely on the support of dovish opposition parties.

   Sharon is expected to win Tuesday's vote, but will need a solid margin
     of victory to silence opponents' demand for a national referendum.

    Sharon opposes a referendum, which would take months to prepare, as a
    stalling tactic and said it would only increase the divisions and the
      hatred on both sides. However, several Cabinet members, including
    Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have called for a national vote.

    Media reports say Sharon should get at least 65 votes and possibly as
     many as 70 in the 120-member Knesset, with fewer than 48 lawmakers
                          voting against the plan.

           The withdrawal plan has stirred passions on both sides.

     Thousands of supporters demonstrated outside the Knesset on Monday
    night, singing songs, waving Israeli flags and holding signs reading
    "leaving settlements a choice for life" and "leave Gaza immediately."

      Opponents plan a major demonstration of their own before the vote
                                  Tuesday.

     In the Gaza settlement of Neve Dekalim, dozens of settlers gathered
    around a campfire Monday evening to burn letters the government sent
   them offering advance compensation payments if they agree to leave the
                              settlement early.

      Sharon was repeatedly heckled during his speech, with hard-liners
    yelling for him to resign and calling him a traitor. Three lawmakers
        were ejected for repeatedly interrupting the prime minister.

   Reaching beyond parliament, Sharon appealed Monday for support from the
        Israeli public, which polls show strongly supports his plan.

     "I call on the people of Israel to unite in this fateful moment, to
     allow us ... to erect a dam against the hatred among us," he said.

   Tuesday's vote is the first of several that Sharon will need to win for
      the plan to be implemented next year. Sharon told Likud lawmakers
   Monday that a final government vote on the withdrawal will come in June
                                  or July.

     Sharon's government remains in danger of falling over other issues,
                            including the budget.

     Also Monday, Israel agreed to let Yasser Arafat leave his Ramallah
   compound for the first time in 2 1/2 years for medical treatment in the
    West Bank city, raising concerns the Palestinian leader is seriously
                                    ill.

     The Defense Ministry said it made the decision after a request from
   Palestinian officials. But Palestinian spokesman Saeb Erekat denied the
   Palestinians asked for such permission and said Arafat will not take up
                                 the offer.

       The 75-year-old Arafat has been suffering from the flu, but is
                   recovering, Palestinian officials said.

    The Israeli media has speculated that Arafat may be far more ill than
   has been disclosed and may actually have cancer. Arafat's health became
   the subject of intense speculation after Tunisian and Egyptian doctors
                were flown in to examine him in recent weeks.

                   Sharon: Gaza plan only way to security
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-26 09:02

        Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon opened a stormy debate in
   parliament Monday with a passionate appeal to lawmakers to support his
     Gaza withdrawal plan which has divided the country and weakened his
            government as the only way to secure Israel's future.

   The withdrawal would mark the first time Israel has pulled down Jewish
    settlements in the West Bank or Gaza, and Sharon is hoping a decisive
   victory in a parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday will blunt calls
                   for a national referendum on the plan.

      Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon confers with an unidentified
   official during a special session in the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
      about his government's proposed 'disengagement plan' in Jerusalem
    Monday, Oct. 25, 2004. Sharon told the parliament he is determined to
    press ahead with his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and part of
    the West Bank, but remains open to peace talks with the Palestinians
     after their violent uprising ends. At left is Deputy Prime Minister
                              Ehud Olmert.[AP]

    "This is a fateful moment for Israel. We are dealing with a difficult
      decision that has few parallels," he said in a speech repeatedly
              interrupted by heckling from hard-line opponents.

       The two-day debate in the Knesset is the climax of a monthslong
    confrontation over the "unilateral disengagement" plan, which Sharon
    has pushed despite strong opposition from much of his Likud Party and
         the threat that it could destroy his coalition government.

      As the debate began, violence flared in Gaza, with Israeli troops
    killing 15 Palestinians and wounding 91 others in a raid on the Khan
        Younis refugee camp to halt Palestinian mortar fire at nearby
               settlements. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded.

      Violence in Gaza has increased in recent months, with Palestinian
      militants trying to prove they are forcing Israel out, and Israel
     seeking to crush the militants to show it is not withdrawing under
                                    fire.

    Sharon says his plan to leave Gaza and pull down four small West Bank
    settlements is vital to ending four years of devastating violence in
    the region. Jewish settlers accuse Sharon of caving in to Palestinian
     violence and fear the withdrawal will be the first step in a larger
                                  pullback.

   Palestinians view the plan with skepticism and worry that Sharon hopes
   to use the limited withdrawal to mute international criticism of Israel
     and strengthen its hold over large parts of the West Bank and East
            Jerusalem, lands the Palestinians claim for a state.

   The program, which will uproot 8,800 settlers, is a sharp reversal for
    the premier, who was once the settlers' top patron in the government.
    Sharon said supporting the withdrawal was the most difficult decision
                             of his long career.

     "I know the significance of the Knesset's decision for thousands of
   Israelis who have lived for many years in the Gaza Strip, who were sent
   there in the name of Israeli governments, and built their homes there.
   Who planted flowers and trees, and brought up their children, who have
    never known another home," he said. "I know this well. I sent many."

   Sharon said his plan was not intended to replace negotiations with the
                        Palestinians in the long run.

    "It is a necessary step during a period in which negotiations are not
       possible. All is open when terror this murderous terror stops."

    Friends and adversaries of the United States voted overwhelmingly in
      the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday against the four-decade-old
      American economic, financial and commercial embargo against Cuba.

    The vote, conducted for the 13th consecutive year, was a lopsided 179
    to 4 with one abstention on the resolution opposing the embargo. The
    United States, Israel, Palau and the Marshall Islands voted "no" and
                            Micronesia abstained.

   Cuba has been under a U.S. trade and travel embargo since Fidel Castro
   defeated a CIA-backed assault at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. In subsequent
      years, some foreign firms have been threatened with penalties for
                             dealing with Cuba.

   "The U.S. government has unleashed a world wide genocidal economic war
   against Cuba," said Havana's foreign minister, Felipe Perez Roque, the
                       only speaker warmly applauded.

     But the U.S. delegate said Cuba has shown no interest implementing
   economic reforms that would lead to democratic change or a free market.

    "The Cuban government is not a victim as it contends. Rather it is a
     tyrant, aggressively punishing anyone who dares to have a differing
          opinion," said Oliver Garza, a State Department adviser.

    Members of the European Union, along with such U.S. allies as Japan,
    Canada, Australia and New Zealand, voted for the resolution, which is
    nonbinding. They again objected to the "extra-territorial" effects of
    U.S. legislation that punishes non-U.S. firms for commercial dealings
                                 with Cuba.

       "The European Union strongly condemns the current human rights
      situation in Cuba, which since 2003 has not shown any significant
   improvement," said the Netherlands deputy ambassador, Arjan Hamburger,
                            speaking for the EU.

     Typical of the more than dozen speakers was Mexico's delegate, who
   criticized the United States for not heeding the resolutions year after
          year, saying this weakened the U.N.'s multilateral role.

    "Mexico is concerned that this type of resolutions that are presented
     year after year do not have any effect on the reality they seek to
           change," said Mexican U.N. Ambassador Enrique Berruga.

     Garza denied the United States was denying Cuba food and medicine,
   saying its had licensed over $1.1 billion in sales and donations since
    1992 and agricultural goods worth more than $5 billion since 2001. In
     addition remittances amounted to about $1 billion a year, he said.

   But Cuba's Perez said that if Washington was so sure Cuba was using the
    blockade as a pretext "why does it not lift the blockade and leave us
                             without a pretext?"

    Presidents and kings mourned Yasser Arafat on Friday, with his wooden
      coffin draped in the Palestinian flag and borne on a horse-drawn
   guncarriage a state funeral for a leader who symbolized the aspirations
                       of Palestinians for statehood.

    After humble prayers in a mosque, a military band in scarlet played a
    funeral dirge and a high-stepping honor guard carried wreaths at the
                  head of an almost-triumphant procession.

    Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah as well
    as Farouk Kaddoumi, the newly chosen head of the Fatah organization,
     and Mahmoud Abbas, head of the PLO executive committee, were among
   those in the front row of about 60 world leaders and other dignitaries
    trailing the casket down Salah Salem Street, which was closed to the
                                   public.

   The service, amid high-security at the Galaa Club, a military compound
   in northern Cairo, was aired live on Egyptian television, although all
   other media was barred from the mosque and tent where most dignitaries
                          sat through the prayers.

    "He has served his people all his life, until he faced his God, with
     courage and honesty. Let us pray for his soul," the Grand Sheik of
       Al-Azhar Mohammed Sayed Tantawi told the gathered dignitaries.
   Throughout the ceremony Egyptian television played Quranic recitations,
                 including a verse: "After hardship, ease."

   Arafat's widow, Suha, watched with their daughter, and both wept as the
                    coffin was lifted from the carriage.

     After the funeral, Arafat's coffin was expected to be taken to the
     Almaza military base just behind the club. From there, it was to be
    flown to el-Arish, in Egypt's northeastern Sinai Peninsula, according
        to Palestinian coordinator Hani Jebour. He said two Jordanian
   helicopters would then ferry the coffin and its accompanying delegation
   to Arafat's Ramallah compound, where he was kept a virtual prisoner in
                 his final years, for burial before sunset.

   Arafat, who died Thursday in Paris, was mourned by Palestinians at home
    and in refugee camps across the region who had hoped he would one day
      lead them back to Jerusalem, and by Arabs who had seen him as an
    inspiring leader. Arab and Israeli authorities took steps to prevent
    any emotional outpouring from evolving into riots, and many countries
         declared official mourning periods for Palestinian leader.

    Harried preparations for Arafat's grave were made in Ramallah. Early
   Friday, workers raked sand to level the ground as they laid gray marble
   slabs around the base of the open, stone-lined, tomb. The Palestinians
    consider the grave site as temporary a place for Arafat's body until
   the day they hope they can honor his request to be buried in Jerusalem.

    Flags flew at half-staff in the compound, where Palestinian policemen
     rehearsed rifle drills for the ceremony. Palestinian Prime Minister
    Ahmed Qureia briefly stopped by to inspect progress on Arafat's tomb,
    while outside a few young men sat, heads clasped in their hands, next
             to posters of Arafat and piles of wilting flowers.

      Security was a concern throughout Cairo, with the possibility of
   demonstrations at mosques and in public squares. The Arab public among
        whom Arafat was popular was told to stay away from the area.

   Early Friday, black-uniformed Egyptian police lined Saleh Salem Street
    near the Galaa Club, where the funeral began at 10 a.m. (3 a.m. EST),
     an hour earlier than officials had said it would. An armed soldier
         watched over the club from high in a minaret of the mosque.

    After a traditional funeral prayer lasting only a couple of minutes,
   eight dark-suited pallbearers carried the casket out of the mosque and
    handed it to an Egyptian honor guard. They placed it inside a silver
    hearse and drove away from the mosque; the carriage stood motionless
                      flanked by Egyptian honor guards.

       Egyptian television showed pictures of Mubarak arriving at the
   colorful, red-carpeted tent on the grounds of the military club. There,
     Farouk Kaddoumi, newly chosen leader of the Fatah organization, and
   Abbas could be seen standing with Arafat's nephew, Palestinian envoy to
         the United Nations Nasser al-Kidwa, to receive condolences.

     Among the dignitaries inside the tent were Syrian President Bashar
   Assad, Sultan Hasanal Bolkiah of Brunei, South African President Thabo
      Mbeki, European Union Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana and Pope
            Shenouda III, head of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church.

    U.N. envoy for the Middle East and a key player in the talks that led
     to the 1993 Oslo peace accord, Terje Roed-Larsen, briefly left the
        reception tent to give an interview to The Associated Press.

      "I grieve with the Palestinian people. The symbol of Palestinian
   identity, the symbol of their aspirations for nationhood, the symbol of
   their aspirations for a Palestinian state has passed away," Roed-Larsen
    said. "Yasser Arafat was more important for Palestinian identity than
                   their flag and their national anthem."

    He said he hoped the new Palestinian leadership would return to peace
                          negotiations with Israel.

   A plane carrying Arafat's coffin arrived late Thursday at Cairo airport
    from a Paris military base. Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of the Egyptian
         president, hugged Arafat's widow, Suha, after she alighted.

     Arafat's coffin was then taken to the nearby Galaa Club, a compound
   that includes a hospital, mosque and social club for military officers.
     It remained in the hospital until being taken to the mosque. Beyond
      usual security concerns, the funeral was designed to prevent any
    outpouring of public emotion that could evolve into angry protests or
   merely show the late Palestinian leader as more popular than other Arab
     leaders. Many Arabs have accused their own governments of doing too
        little to help the Palestinians through the latest uprising.

   Egyptian authorities went out of their way to tell the public to steer
                    clear of the suburban Cairo funeral.

       "I would like to draw your attention to something that is very
      important: It's an official military funeral and not open to the
       public," Col. Ahmed Assem of the Interior Ministry told Egypt's
                      state-run television on Thursday.

       The U.S. Embassy in Cairo warned Americans to avoid areas where
   spontaneous protests might occur, including the downtown Tahrir Square,
                    a traditional site of demonstrations.

    In Jerusalem, Israeli police also took steps to prevent rioting, with
    plans to impose restrictions on entry to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound
    for prayers on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A
     police statement said only men over 45 with Israeli identification
         cards will be allowed to enter the mosque compound, Islam's
        third-holiest shrine. The restrictions do not apply to women.

                  India offers Kashmir talks, pulls troops
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-11-18 09:42

   India's prime minister offered Wednesday to hold unconditional talks on
     Kashmir "with anyone and everyone" as his country began withdrawing
   troops from the divided Himalayan region as a goodwill gesture to rival
                                  Pakistan.

      But a gunbattle launched by militants hours before Prime Minister
   Manmohan Singh's rare visit to the region underscored the fragility of
                             the peace process.

      India has not announced how many troops it will withdraw from the
    highly militarized frontier with Pakistan, but news reports have said
     only about 40,000 of a half million troops would be redeployed. The
    first contingent of at least 1,000 soldiers headed out Wednesday from
      the Khanabal base camp, 35 miles south of the region's main city
          Srinagar, an army officer said on condition of anonymity.

       Srinagar, Kashmir, India, Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2004. Singh vowed
    Wednesday to move peace talks forward in insurgency-wracked Kashmir,
     saying he was prepared to hold unconditional talks with anyone and
    everyone. Person behind Singh is a member of his security personnel.

     accompanied by Jammu Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed,

     right, and Congress leader Ambika Soni, during a public meeting in

    Wednesday to move peace talks forward in insurgency-wracked Kashmir,
     saying he was prepared to hold unconditional talks with anyone and
    everyone. Person behind Singh is a member of his security personnel.
                                    [AP]
      "We want a permanent end to violence," Singh said in a speech to
    graduating doctors in Srinagar. "I am prepared to hold unconditional
                      talks with anyone and everyone."

   India has cited a decline in separatist violence as the main reason for
       its troop withdrawal. But violence flared again Wednesday when
   suspected separatists lobbed grenades and fired at soldiers in Srinagar
                           ahead of Singh's visit.

     Two suspected militants were killed and two soldiers and a civilian
   wounded in the attack, said K. Srinivasan, Border Security Force chief.

      Kashmir is divided between the nuclear-armed neighbors with both
   claiming all of it. India accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim insurgents
   fighting for the region's independence or merger with Islamic Pakistan.
                            Islamabad denies it.

    Talks with Kashmiri separatists began last year during the tenure of
   Singh's predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But Wednesday's speech was a
     strong signal the new government would press for an end to tensions
               with Pakistan and separatist Islamic militants.

    "It is an important day in my life. I was waiting for this for a long
    time," said Singh, who was given a standing ovation by the crowd. "I
   have come here with the realization and hope that I can understand what
                     your aspirations and desires are."

     The two-day visit, Singh's first to the region since becoming prime
       minister in May, won praise among Kashmiris, many of whom feel
         disconnected from the rest of India and distrust the Indian
                               establishment.

   "For the first time, an Indian leader was not speaking to Pakistan. He
          was speaking to us," said 45-year-old teacher Tariq Butt.

   Singh was expected to soon announce a $1.5 billion economic development
    plan for Kashmir, an aide to the prime minister said on condition of
                                 anonymity.

    The plan was to include a $890 million contribution from the federal
       government, with the rest of the money coming from domestic and
   international financial institutions, the aide said. The funds would go
    toward building new roads, developing infrastructure for water, power
                  and health care and building new schools.

      In his speech, Singh said economic issues are a major part of the
     problem in Kashmir, where rampant unemployment has helped create a
                     generation of disillusioned youths.

    "We have to rebuild the economy, change the manner of government and
               root out nepotism and corruption," said Singh.

        Despite such talk, militant shootings and bomb attacks remain
                           commonplace in Kashmir.

      While some separatists have begun talks with the government, many
        remain opposed to discussions. Separatists shut down much of
    Jammu-Kashmir on Wednesday with a general strike, called to coincide
    with Singh's visit and protest the central government's control over
   the region. Only a few cars and motorcycles were on the roads, and most
                           businesses were closed.

   Pakistan has welcomed the troop reduction, which Singh has said was the
                result of a lessening in separatist violence.

       "This confidence-building measure would further facilitate the
   (India-Pakistan) dialogue," Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Masood
                                 Khan said.

   The separatist insurgency has ravaged Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority
    state in predominantly Hindu India. More than 65,000 people have died
                                 since 1989.

   The militancy and a five-decade territorial dispute over Kashmir are at
      the heart of the India-Pakistan rivalry and two wars between the
                                  nations.

                Leading Iraq parties call for election delay
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-11-27 08:04

   Leading Iraqi political parties, including the two main Kurdish groups
     closely allied to the United States, called on Friday for elections
      scheduled for Jan. 30 to be postponed because of Iraq's widening
                                  violence.

        Following a meeting at the Baghdad home of Adnan Pachachi, an
    influential, moderate Sunni leader and former presidential candidate,
      15 political parties and groups signed a petition calling for the
                election to be put off for up to six months.

      "The participants call for elections to be delayed and to be held
    within six months, allowing for changes in the security situation and
      completion of necessary arrangements in terms of organization and
                     administration," the petition read.

         Three interim government ministers attended the meeting and
     representatives from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the
            Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) signed the petition.

     A delegate from the Iraqi National Accord, headed by Prime Minister
                   Iyad Allawi, attended but did not sign.

      US President Bush in Crawford, Texas, said he wanted the vote as
                                 scheduled.

       "In terms of Iraq, the Iraqi Election Commission has scheduled
    elections in January, and I would hope they'd go forward in January,"
                                 Bush said.

     Significantly, no representatives of the country's two main Shi'ite
     parties, Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in
    Iraq, were present. Their absence highlighted division in the country
            on religious lines between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims.

    Most Shi'ites, who make up about 60 percent of Iraq's population, are
   eager for early elections. Oppressed during Saddam Hussein's rule, they
     are eager to cement the increased political power they have gained
                            since his overthrow.

   The call for postponement comes amid mounting violence, particularly in
   Sunni Muslim areas to the north and west of Baghdad, and follows calls
    from influential Sunni religious and political groups for the poll to
                                be postponed.

   British security firm Global Risk Strategies said four of its employees
     were killed and about 15 wounded in a mortar attack on the heavily
                      defended Green Zone on Thursday.

     In recent weeks, the Muslim Clerics' Association, a group of senior
     Sunni scholars, has called for a boycott of the poll. And the Iraqi
   Islamic Party, the country's main Sunni party, which also attending the
   meeting and signed the petition, has said it will boycott the elections
                        if they go ahead as planned.

   In the wake of the U.S.-led offensive on the Sunni city of Falluja, and
    fighting in Sunni-dominant towns such as Samarra, Baquba, Tikrit and
    areas around Baghdad, the parties argue that there is not enough time
                     to arrange free and fair elections.

    Iraq's interim constitution says elections must be held by the end of
      January to choose a parliament that will select a new cabinet and
              oversee the writing of a permanent constitution.

       Pachachi's backing for an election postponement is significant.

   The Sunni politician is seen as an Iraqi elder statesman and is closely
   allied to Washington. He was the preferred choice of the United Nations
   for the Iraqi presidency, but the post went instead to Ghazi al-Yawar,
                           a Sunni tribal leader.

    The participation of the Kurds is also significant. Not only are they
    close to the United States, but Kurdish regional elections, a chance
    for the parties to show their strength and influence, were due to be
                          held on Jan. 30 as well.

                              GREEN ZONE ATTACK

      The push for a postponement came amid persistent violence across
     central and northern Iraq, with insurgents even managing to strike
     inside the most protected area of Iraq, the heavily fortified Green
                    Zone, home to the interim government.

    London-based firm Global Risk Strategies, reporting the death of four
    staff in an attack on the Green Zone, gave no further information on
   the incident or nationalities of the casualties. Coalition sources said
    they were believed to be Nepalese Gurkhas, hundreds of whom work for
                               Global in Iraq.

      The Green Zone, a sprawling complex surrounded by blast walls, is
    attacked by mortars or rockets regularly, although most attacks cause
                               little damage.

    Two loud explosions echoed from the area on Thursday and thick black
                  smoke was seen rising above the compound.

        Global employs more than 1,000 security personnel in Iraq and
    Afghanistan, protecting installations such as Baghdad's international
                                  airport.

   Srinagar, November 28
   In a fit of anger after he was punished, a CRPF constable went on a
   shooting spree killing seven of his colleagues, including a company
   commander, and injuring two before being shot dead at the battalion
   headquarters in Jammu and Kashmirs Baramulla district late last night.

   CRPF Inspector-General Ranjit Sinha told reporters that constable S.
   Deka fired indiscriminately killing company commander Sadu Ram, a
   sub-inspector, a head constable and four constables before he was shot
   dead inside the headquarters of the 152 battalion, he said.

   Besides Sadu Ram, the other victims were sub-inspector Chandra Ram,
   head constable K.D. Sharma, constables Tariqnath Dey, Maria Pillay,
   Hardeep Singh and Kuldeep Singh.

   CRPF Director-General J.K. Sinha said Deka, who was recruited in 2003,
   and was in Jammu and Kashmir on his first posting, was not present
   during the roll call and was reprimanded and given three days of
   fatigue duty, a kind of punishment.

   He said CRPF Additional Director-General Shyam Mehra would inquire into
   the incident and submit his report in three days.

   Mr Ranjit Sinha said, We are examining all aspects that prompted the
   jawan to take the extreme step.

   Union Minister of State for Home Sriprakash Jaiswal told reporters in
   Kanpur that it seemed that the jawan had taken the extreme step due to
   frustration or tension. He said the government would try to address the
   causes of frustration and tension among security personnel working in
   difficult areas.

   Meanwhile, militants killed four persons, including two former
   colleagues and a counter-insurgent, in the Kashmir Valley, whereas the
   security forces recovered two kg of RDX since last evening, a police
   spokesman said today. PTI

Iran: U.S. Drones Spy On Nukes

   Iran's intelligence chief on Wednesday accused the United States of
   flying spy drones over its nuclear sites and threatened to shoot down
   the unmanned surveillance crafts.
   Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi comments backed a report in The
   Washington Post on Sunday that quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying
   the drones have been flying over Iran for nearly a year to seek
   evidence of nuclear weapons programs.
   "U.S. spying activities over Iranian airspace have been going since a
   long time ago," Yunesi told reporters.
   "Most of the shining objects that our people see in Iran's airspace are
   American spying equipment used to spy on Iran's nuclear and military
   facilities," the minister told reporters.
   Iranian media has been gripped by a kind of "flying object" fever with
   dozens of reported sightings in recent weeks. State-run media has
   reported numerous sightings of unknown objects flying over parts of
   Iran where nuclear facilities are located.
   In an incident on Wednesday, there were reports of anti-aircraft fire
   and an explosion near the town of Deilam, about 60 miles from a nuclear
   facility. Iranian state television later said that the explosion may
   have been caused by a fuel tank dropping from an Iranian plane.
   In speaking to reporters, the Iranian minister said U.S. surveillance
   flights would not reveal anything the United States doesn't already
   know.
   "Our nuclear activities are open and very transparent. Our military
   activities are all legal," Yunesi said. He spoke while visiting a
   prison for dissidents under the Shah that has been turned into a
   museum.
   The Washington Post reported the drones had been flying over Iran from
   U.S. military bases in Iraq and were equipped with air filters to pick
   up traces of nuclear activity.
   In December, the Iranian air force was ordered to shoot down any
   unknown flying objects. At the time, there were reports in Iranian
   newspapers that Iran had discovered spying devices in pilotless planes
   its air defense force had shot down.
   "If any of the bright objects come close, they will definitely meet our
   fire and will be shot down. We possess the necessary equipment to
   confront them," Yunesi said.
   Last month, Yunesi said the United States had been conducting aerial
   surveillance, but he neither mentioned drones nor nuclear and military
   sites. Yunesi said U.S. commandoes had not entered Iran, adding the
   security forces would catch any American who did.
   The unidentified objects described by Iranian media were spotted near
   Natanz — which has a uranium enrichment plant — and Isfahan, which has
   a facility for producing uranium hexaflouride gas, the feedstock for
   enriching uranium.
   Uranium enriched to low grades is used for fuel in nuclear reactors.
   Further enrichment makes it suitable for atomic bombs.
   The United States accuses Iran of having a secret program to
   manufacture nuclear weapons. Iran denies this, saying its nuclear
   program is entirely for the generation of electricity.
   Middle East expert and Brooking Instituion Senior Fellow Shibley
   Telhami says a nuclear Iran poses new questions for the United States
   and Israel.
   "Military option remain very very limited for the U.S. and Israel,"
   Telhami said. "It is clear that Iran is not Iraq, Iran has far more
   potential militarily. It is clear they have learned the lesson of the
   1980 Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor and most likely have
   dispersed their assets. I think in the short term, the reality remains
   military option is very limited, very dangerous and has got a lot of
   consequences."

Syria flexes muscle in Lebanon

   BEIRUT, LEBANON â Lebanon's parliament is set Friday to rubber-stamp a
   Syrian-ordained decision to grant its close ally President Emile Lahoud
   an additional three years in office.

   But the move, which has sparked a storm of protest here as well as
   international disapproval, now faces a formidable challenge from the
   United Nations Security Council, which was expected Thursday to preempt
   the Lebanese parliament by approving a resolution effectively giving
   Syria 30 days to leave Lebanon.

   The UN intervention and mounting domestic opposition is rapidly turning
   the debate over the presidential extension into the most serious crisis
   in Lebanese-Syrian relations since the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil
   war.

   "This is the greatest miscalculation Syria has made in recent years,"
   says Farid Khazen, professor of politics at the American University of
   Beirut. "The Syrians thought they could get away with imposing their
   man on Lebanon, but they failed to realize that the world has changed."

   Mr. Lahoud's six-year term was supposed to end in November in
   accordance with the Lebanese Constitution. But Syria made it known last
   week that it wanted its ally to remain.

   The unusually blatant nature of the decision outraged the mainly
   Christian opposition and has stunned even Syria's Lebanese allies. It
   also had the rare effect of uniting the United States and France on a
   Middle East issue, with the two countries cosponsoring the draft UN
   Security Council resolution.

   Simon Karam, a former Lebanese ambassador to Washington and a member of
   the Qornet Shehwan opposition group, says that if Lahoud is granted his
   extension, "the relationship between Lebanon and Syria will turn from
   the facade coalition that it is now into sheer occupation," he says.

   The draft Security Council resolution includes demands that Syria
   withdraw its estimated 15,000 troops from Lebanon and that all militias
   to be dismantled, a reference to Lebanon's Hizbullah organization. If
   the demands are not met within 30 days, "additional measures" could be
   taken to enforce the resolution, raising the possibility of economic
   and financial sanctions again Syria and Lebanon.

   Damascus already faces strong pressure from the US for its support of
   Palestinian and Lebanese organizations designated in Washington as
   terrorist groups, as well as its alleged pursuit of weapons of mass
   destruction and its opposition to the US role in Iraq.

   But Michael Young, a Lebanese political commentator, says that Syria's
   backing for Lahoud shows it prefers the status quo.

   "It's a simple rule with the Syrians. They are not comfortable with
   change, especially when they feel under pressure," Mr. Young says.

   But domestic opposition to Lahoud's presidential extension is gaining
   momentum. The influential Maronite church issued a withering indictment
   on Wednesday of Syria's interference in Lebanese affairs, saying
   Damascus treats Lebanon as if it were a "Syrian province."

   "Syria gives orders, appoints leaders, organizes parliamentary and
   other elections, brings in whoever it wants and drops whoever it wants,
   and interferes in all aspects of life: in the administration, the
   judiciary, the economy and particularly politics, through its
   representatives here and their aides," the statement said.

   The crisis has left Syria's allies struggling to justify publicly why
   the president should be granted a further term in office.

   "It is our choice that the president remain because the situation in
   the region is unstable and change at this time is not beneficial," says
   Qassem Qanso, a minister of state, the head of the Lebanese branch of
   the Baath Party, and one of Syria's closest allies.

   But amending the Lebanese constitution to grant Lahoud an extra three
   years in office requires two-thirds of parliament to vote in favor of
   the measure.

   The key to the vote resides with Lebanon's redoubtable prime minister,
   Rafik Hariri, a billionaire businessman who has steered the country
   through its post-civil war reconstruction phase. Mr. Hariri, who heads
   the largest parliamentary bloc, is a bitter rival of the president.

   Hariri had indicated he would resign if Lahoud stayed on as president.
   But he appeared to change his mind after meeting with Gen. Rustum
   Ghazali, the head of Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon, who plays
   the role of Syrian proconsul here. Hariri subsequently told his bloc to
   vote as they please before heading to his holiday home in Sardinia for
   a short break.

   Analysts say that the prospect of another three years of political and
   economic paralysis between Hariri and Lahoud spells disaster for the
   country. "We've had no political life and economic life has been
   blocked," Young says. "And all the Syrians can do is perpetuate this."

   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf this week urged steps to end the
   bitter dispute.

By Scott Baldauf, Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor October 29,
2004

   Save for later Saved

   NEW DELHI â Within hours of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's
   dramatic proposal this Monday to demilitarize the disputed region of
   Kashmir, both India and Pakistan demurred.

   Refusing to consider its merits, Indian officials said that the
   proposal should have been sent through "proper channels." Pakistani
   leaders, meanwhile, said their president shouldn't have made the offer
   at all, calling it a "betrayal" of the Kashmir cause.

   Ironically, what appeared to be a breakthrough only underscored both
   countries' inability to resolve even the simplest matters in the
   57-year territorial dispute that has sparked three wars and cost tens
   of thousands of Kashmiri lives.

   Neither the new Congress-led government in Delhi nor Mr. Musharraf's
   freshly handpicked Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has the political
   strength to pass any radical proposal through their parliaments.

   Also, neither country has the military power to control Kashmir
   outright. Given that, experts say, negotiation can only bring
   superficial change.

   "This kind of posturing is not intended to further the peace process,
   but ... obstruct it, and the media inevitably play into the trap by
   shaking up an international storm over 'new proposals'" says Ajai
   Sahni, executive director of the Institute of Conflict Management, a
   New Delhi think tank. "The idea that negotiations ... can create a
   different outcome than the facts dictated by the balance of power is
   ridiculous."

   To be sure, there has been some progress from the yearlong series of
   talks started after India's then-Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
   extended his "hand of friendship" to Pakistan last winter. Bus services
   between the Pakistani city of Lahore and the Indian city of Amritsar
   have restarted, air links between the two countries have been reopened,
   and this week, a group of Pakistani pilgrims were allowed to visit Sufi
   shrines in the Indian section of Kashmir.

   At face value, Musharraf's proposals are bold. He suggested that
   Pakistan would be willing to set aside its demand for a Kashmir vote
   for self-determination if India would set aside its policy of making
   the current cease-fire line into a permanent boundary. Instead, he
   urged both sides to pull back their troops, identify each of the seven
   regions of Kashmir, and decide their status afterward.

   Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said last month that his country
   was open to "possible options for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of
   the issue."

   Yet the manner in which Musharraf announced his proposal - in front of
   editors of Pakistan's major newspapers - is a painful reminder of the
   general's penchant for thunderstealing publicity, often followed by
   limited results.

   "[Musharraf] is superb at making tactical gestures, but these have
   little meaning or substance," says Sumit Ganguly, director of the India
   Studies Program at Indiana University. "Given the latent and
   understandable distrust of Musharraf in New Delhi, I suspect that
   Congress [India's ruling party] will proceed with considerable
   deliberation."

   Indeed, Congress has responded coolly. Indian official Navtej Singh
   Sarna said tartly, "We do not believe that Jammu and Kashmir is a
   subject on which discussion can be held through the media."

   Even Kashmiri separatist parties seemed miffed by Musharraf's proposal,
   in part because the general never considered a third option between
   Indian or Pakistani control: independence.

   "Unless the people of the state are made party to any negotiated
   settlement, it will meet the same fate" as previous agreements, said
   Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the Kashmiri separatist coalition, the
   All Parties Hurriyat Conference.

   Back home, Musharraf's proposal has not exactly swept Pakistanis off
   their feet.

   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called Musharraf's plan a
   "betrayal" of Kashmiris, and the leader Syed Salahuddin - head of
   Kashmiri militant group Hizbul Mujahideen - rejected Musharraf's call
   for a debate. "Such a debate will cause a wedge in Pakistan's
   principled position, which will be a national loss," he said.

   The problem now is Musharraf's inability to sell his ideas to the
   Pakistani public, says Najam Sethi, editor of the Friday Times
   newspaper in Lahore.

   "This is a great proposal" says Mr. Sethi. "But the problem is: Where
   is the mainstream support for this?"
