   children, at a school in Russia near the border with Chechnya.

   A group of around 17 heavily armed men and women stormed the secondary
   school, in the southern city of Beslan, during a morning ceremony being
   held to mark the first day of the new school year.

   There were conflicting reports about casualties. The Itar-Tass news
   agency said eight people died in the initial attack but officials put
   the death toll at between two and four.

   Russia's regional emergencies minister, Boris Dzgoyev, said two
   civilians were killed and nine hospitalised. His ministry said 13
   people suffered gunshot wounds, including two women.

   Among those killed at the start of the hostage-taking were a father who
   had attempted to resist the terrorists and one of the attackers, who
   was shot dead by police.

   Tass quoted Valery Andreyev, head of the FSB intelligence service in
   Russia's North Ossetia province, as saying contact has been made with
   the hostage-takers.

   The regional chief of the federal security service, Valery Andreyev,
   said on NTV television that negotiations "are ... just beginning" and
   that brief contact has not allowed authorities to evaluate the
   situation at the school.

   Kazbek Dzantiyev, head of the regional interior ministry, said the
   hostages have threatened "for every destroyed fighter, they will kill
   50 children and for every injured fighter, 20 [children]", ITAR-Tass
   reported.

   One report claimed that the gang has demanded Russia pull out of
   Chechnya and release fighters seized in the neighbouring province of
   Ingushetia during a huge rebel raid on the region in June.

   Earlier reports had put the number of hostages at around 400, including
   200 children, but the figure was later revised.

   Officials cited by Russia's Interfax news agency said the number of
   hostages was between 120 and 150, but the number of pupils among them
   was not specified.

   Ruslan Ayamov, spokesman for North Ossetia's interior ministry, denied
   earlier reports that the hostage-takers had freed 15 of children.
   However, he said some students had managed to escape by hiding in the
   school's boiler room when the terrorists stormed the site, and then
   later fleeing.

   The Russian news agency RIA reported that the attackers had mined the
   school's gymnasium and threatened to blow it up if security forces
   attempted to intervene. A regional police official told the Associated
   Press that the hostages had been herded into the gym building.

   Parents of the seized children have recorded a video appeal urging the
   Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to meet the terrorists' demands. The
   text of the appeal was not immediately available.

   Around 1,000 people, most of them parents, gathered outside the site,
   demanding information and accusing the authorities of failing to
   protect their children.

   Mr Putin, who interrupted his holiday to return to Moscow and address
   the latest in a wave of violence linked to separatist rebels in
   Chechnya, sent his interior minister and the head of the FSB security
   service to the scene.

   In London, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said: "No cause can justify
   such wicked acts of terrorism. My thoughts, and the thoughts of the
   British people, are with you and the Russian people at this difficult
   time."

   Russia's UN ambassador, Andrey Denisov, called for the UN Security
   Council to convene urgently to discuss the spate of recent terrorist
   acts, Interfax reported.

   Today's seizure came hours after a suicide bomber last night killed 10
   people and injured more than 50 outside a Moscow subway station. Last
   week, terrorists were blamed after two Russian airliners crashed,
   killing 90 people.

   Belsan is in the republic of North Ossetia, which borders wartorn
   Chechnya. The identities or origin of the kidnappers were not known,
   but their tactics and demands suggest they are Chechen separatist
   rebels.

   One report said a local Muslim leader had entered the school to meet
   the attackers, but had been turned away. They insisted they would
   negotiate only with the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia.

   Chechen rebels have taken hostages in the past. In 2002, terrorists
   held hundreds of people hostage in a Moscow theatre, wrapping many of
   the women in explosives.

   The siege ended when Russian security forces used an opiate-based gas
   to disable the gunmen. However, it was later revealed that more than
   100 of the hostages had died as a result of inhaling the gas.

   In 1995, Chechen rebels led by warlord Shamil Basayev seized a hospital
   in the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, taking around 2,000 people
   hostage. The six-day standoff ended with a fierce Russian police
   assault, and around 100 people died in the incident.

   On Sunday, presidential elections were held in Chechnya - a
   Kremlin-baked move aimed at undermining support for insurgents by
   establishing a degree of civil order in the republic.

   Fears that Chechen rebels aimed to take their fight outside the
   republic's borders increased in June after insurgents launched a
   coordinated series of attacks on police facilities in neighbouring
   Ingushetia, killing more than 90 people.

   In a video released several days after the attack, a man appearing to
   be Basayev claimed responsibility for the assaults, saying his fighters
   had seized huge quantities of arms from police arsenals.

Dr Yudhoyono poised to remedy Indonesian ills

   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono

   You cannot call him "Mr President" yet, but you could try Dr Susilo
   Bambang Yudhoyono.

   While waiting to become Indonesia's next leader, the former general
   entered the classroom over the weekend to defend a doctoral thesis on
   poverty and unemployment, subjects that could not be more important for
   when he takes office on October 20.

   Dr Yudhoyono will soon rule the world's fourth most populous nation,
   but that counted for little in front of six examiners at the
   prestigious Bogor Institute of Agriculture, where he was grilled for
   three hours.

   The encounter displayed the differences with outgoing President
   Megawati Soekarnoputri, whom Dr Yudhoyono crushed in Indonesia's first
   direct presidential poll last month.

   A student who twice failed university courses, Mrs Megawati had little
   interest in the details of governing her messy country, nor explaining
   the finer points to her 220 million people.

   Dr Yudhoyono, known as a "thinking" general when he wore uniform, has
   at least shown he has the intellectual capacity to grasp the problems
   that bedevil Indonesia.

   Indeed, his 56-page thesis was rated excellent and was swiftly
   accepted. Titled "The development of agriculture and village life as a
   way to overcome poverty and unemployment", it was the final requirement
   for his doctorate at the institute south of Jakarta.

   Watched by 200 fellow students, most of them half his age, Dr Yudhoyono
   fought back tears as he left student life.

   "For more than three years I have studied without leaving my posts . .
   . it has been some of the most beautiful and challenging moments for
   me," said Dr Yudhoyono, 55, who has served in several previous
   administrations.

   In his campaign speeches, Dr Yudhoyono promised to raise productivity
   in Indonesia's agriculture sector.

   He also pledged to cut poverty by creating jobs, a tall order for a
   country where foreign investment has dried up because of endemic graft,
   red tape and tough labour laws.

   While his thesis was peppered with jargon and theories but no case
   studies, students seemed impressed with his brain power. "When he
   becomes president and implements his theories, I'm sure it will make
   Indonesia a better place," masters student Ria Kusumawati, 23, said
   while watching the presentation on television screens outside a student
   hall.

   Dr Yudhoyono has had time to hone his doctoral arguments, lying low at
   his home in Bogor while waiting for the election commission to declare
   his victory valid tomorrow.

   Asked about his cabinet, the man who also holds a master's in
   management refused to give details but said ministers would sign
   accountability contracts, indicating that, unlike previous governments,
   poor performing ministers may not last.

   Dr Yudhoyono is not the first Indonesian head of state to hold a
   doctorate. Former president B. J. Habibie holds an engineering
   doctorate from a German university.

Rupert Murdoch leaves his heart in Adelaide

   annual general meeting in Adelaide.

   Depending on who you spoke to, it was either the end of an era or
   business as usual at yesterday's News Corporation annual general
   meeting in Adelaide.

   "I'll see you next year," chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch
   told shareholders after a marathon session agreed to shift the
   organisation's headquarters from Adelaide to the blue-chip US corporate
   haven of Delaware.

   According to Murdoch, 73 - who 51 years ago used the feisty Adelaide
   afternoon tabloid, The News, to build a $29 billion global empire - the
   change was just legal noise. He would be back next year as usual for
   drinks, cake and a chat with his loyal shareholders.

   "Let's be clear about this," Murdoch said. "We're not moving anything,
   we're not moving any people, we're not moving anyone, it's a legal
   basis so that we will be seen as an American company."

   He promised that his heart would remain in Adelaide. "Today, as I look
   across this vast ballroom, there are so many familiar faces, so many
   loyal shareholders who have encouraged me with their kind words and
   loyal support as we've made our journey from a single newspaper into a
   global media company."

   There was a sense of history to the occasion not lost on those closest
   to him, among them daughter Prudence MacLeod, who yesterday made a rare
   appearance at a News Corp annual general meeting.

   Ms MacLeod, the only child from his Adelaide marriage to the late
   Patricia Booker and the first of his six children, moved to Sydney from
   London two years ago with husband Alasdair MacLeod, managing director
   of News Limited's Community Newspapers.

   She said she had been at an AGM only once before "because I've not been
   here, on this side of the world". "It's sad but exciting and it's
   historic. But there will be a (information) meeting every year so
   that's nice."

   More than 500 people attended News Corp's 25th and last annual meeting
   in Adelaide.

   Ms MacLeod, who sat in the front row next to Rupert Murdoch's sister,
   Janet Calvert-Jones, said the connection with Adelaide would be
   maintained. "I mean, it's an Australian company, at least in everyone's
   head," she said. "It's almost just paperwork. I don't think the
   romanticism (of its Adelaide beginnings) is going."

   The other Murdoch heir in attendance yesterday was Prudence MacLeod's
   stepbrother, Lachlan, who as chairman of News Ltd sat on stage with his
   father and next to him at a press conference. Lachlan kept a low
   profile, answering the occasional question but staying out of the
   limelight. His mind may have been on other things. While he was in
   Adelaide his wife, Sarah O'Hare, was in Sydney about to give birth to
   their first child.

   It was difficult not to wonder if the News shift to the US was due in
   some way to the presence in the past six years of corporate governance
   warrior Stephen Mayne.

   Before Mayne started coming, Murdoch faced one question from the floor
   in seven years. Yesterday, Murdoch and his fellow directors took
   questions about US inheritance tax, Murdoch's superannuation, his
   contract (he doesn't have one), his $US27 million in salary and bonuses
   and the notoriously low News Corp dividends. Not all the questions came
   from Mayne, although he was the one to tell Murdoch he was $1 billion
   out of pocket from the 14 per cent downward adjustment in the company's
   share price from the US move.

   "It's the best sport of the season," said Mayne, who runs the
   Crikey.com.au website.

   "There is no better sport in shareholder activism than jousting with
   Rupert."

U2 launches colour iPod

   Paint it black: a front and back view of the U2 iPod, with the band's
   autographs on the rear.

   Apple Computer Inc has introduced a new larger-capacity iPod with a
   colour display as well as a first-of-its-kind digital compendium of the
   rock band U2's songs.

   U2's lead singer Bono and guitarist The Edge joined Apple chief
   executive Steve Jobs on stage in a newly renovated 1920s era theatre in
   San Jose to unveil the new products.

   Apple's latest effort to maintain supremacy in the portable audio
   player market and the online music business also includes a new special
   edition U2 iPod.

   Analysts expect the Apple-U2 partnerships to be the first of many to
   come between artists and music product providers.

   The digital album set will be available for $US149 ($200) at the iTunes
   online music store in late November. A digital boxed set, it brings
   together  400 U2 tracks from the band’s career -  including every U2
   album and  over 25 rare and unreleased tracks.

   The new iPod Photo has a colour screen that can display photos and
   slide shows accompanied by music. The 60-gigabyte model can hold 25,000
   photos, costs $US599 ($800), and is available now. A 40-gigabyte model
   costs $US499 ($670).

   The special edition U2 iPod is a 20-gigabyte iPod that's encased in
   black with a red click wheel instead of being all white. It will cost
   $US349 ($470) and will be available in November.

   U2 was among the first artists to endorse Apple when it introduced the
   groundbreaking iTunes store that helped jumpstart the legal music
   download market.

   "We see it as a next step for us and the music industry," The Edge
   said.

   Apple has continually introduced new features and slimmer iPod models
   with a longer battery life. It introduced the diminutive 4-gigabyte
   iPod Mini in January for $US249 ($335) and unveiled the
   fourth-generation, 20 and 40-gigabyte models of the iPod in July,
   lowering their respective prices by $US100 ($135) to $US299 ($400) and
   $US399 ($540).
   Susan Kevorkian, an analyst at market research firm IDC says to sustain
   its market lead, "Apple is going to have to keep innovating at the same
   price point, or introduce other products that are less expensive, and
   offering a flash-based player will be an easy way to do it."

   In the past month, five companies have unveiled their latest iPod
   challengers - portable music players with hard disks that can store
   anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 songs.
   There's Dell Inc's new Pocket DJ, Virgin Electronics' Player, Creative
   Labs Inc's Zen Micro, iRiver America Inc's H300, and Archos Inc's Gmini
   XS200.
   "Everyone is trying to get a bite out of Apple's piece of the pie,"
   said Kevorkian.

   Analysts say Apple could continue to dominate but expect that its
   market share will erode amid the slew of new arrivals that are matching
   the iPod's storage capacity, nearing it in style and ease of use,
   adding extra features like an FM tuner or voice recorder and, in some
   cases, undercutting Apple in price.
   The competition also includes players introduced earlier this year from
   Samsung Electronics Co, Sony Corp, and MP3 player pioneer, Rio Audio.
   But Apple always has more tricks up its sleeves.

Australians wary of Pak trio

     * Last time: Aust vs Pakistan, Perth, 1999

   Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist have backed Australia's relentless
   pressure to overcome Pakistan's erratic brilliance this summer, but say
   it will be vital to keep three of the tourists' most dangerously
   mercurial stars subdued.

   McGrath has highlighted captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and his fellow
   middle-order batsman Yousuf Youhana as the Pakistanis Australia will
   have to watch the closest as the three-match series begins at the WACA
   Ground on Thursday.

   And wicketkeeper-batsman Gilchrist knows from experience how speedster
   Shoaib Akhtar can turn a match in half-an-hour.

   But over five days, the Australians are confident of absorbing the
   heaviest blows from the unpredictable Pakistanis as they try to stretch
   their unbeaten home run to 21 successive series.

   Gilchrist was reading little into Pakistan's woeful form so far in the
   warm-up games.

   "All of us have seen Pakistan be hot and cold, whether it's in a tour
   match or an international game. We'll be wary of them still. A lot of
   touring teams over the years have come to the WACA for the first game
   of the tour and struggled," he said, conceding there would be days in
   this series when Pakistan will dominate.

   "Their batting has that kind of flair whereby they can take it away
   from you in a short space of time. They have that ability, with the
   attacking flair of their players, and Shoaib (Akhtar) is the prime
   example.

   "He's done it to us before. He can have a bowling spell where he'll
   come on and, particularly with reverse swing at his pace, he can take
   5-20 with one spell and totally end an innings. But we try to back
   ourselves against most teams in that scenario. That's Test cricket,
   you've got the ability to lose a session or lose a day and still come
   back. As long as you still come back from that - that's where we think
   we're a good team."

   At a relaxed first training session in baking hot Perth, Gilchrist was
   not about to go into Justin Langer-style lyrical waxing about Akhtar.
   Langer recently gushed that he often found himself preoccupied by
   Akhtar as he lay in his bed at night.

     Some days, they (Pakistan) don't play too well, other days they can
     beat anyone.
     GLENN McGRATH

   "Justin dreams about him? I won't touch that," Gilchrist told guffawing
   reporters, before adding: "Others probably have nightmares about him.
   We've played him before. We've played him bowling fast, we've played
   him bowling slow, we've seen him trying all his tricks."

   Illustrating the unpredictable qualities of a side that has played only
   five Tests this year - to Australia's 12 - McGrath was not even sure
   yesterday who would be his target.

   Instead, he hedged his bets, saying: "You never know with Pakistan.
   Some days they don't play too well, other days they can beat anyone.
   They have a bit of a younger team this time. I haven't seen a great
   deal of their players, so that'll be interesting.

   "But Youhana and Inzi are still class players and they're big wickets."

   GEORGETOWN, Del., Nov. 15 - Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of
   the Walt Disney Company, played down his decades-long relationship with
   the former Disney president Michael S. Ovitz on Monday, as he began
   testifying in a shareholder lawsuit over the board's handling of Mr.
   Ovitz's brief and controversial tenure in the mid-1990's.

   Mr. Eisner described Mr. Ovitz as charming, clever and an enjoyable
   dinner companion over their years in the entertainment business, but
   disputed Mr. Ovitz's previous testimony that the two men were close
   friends.

   "Michael Ovitz had a lot of best friends," said Mr. Eisner, wearing his
   signature Mickey Mouse tie. "Michael Ovitz was -- is -- a salesman, and
   we all deal in hyperbole."

   Mr. Eisner added: "We're talking semantics here."

   Mr. Eisner's testimony comes in the fifth week of the trial in which
   Disney shareholders contend that the board breached its fiduciary
   responsibility when it hired Mr. Ovitz, the former agent and co-founder
   of the Creative Artists Agency, as president in 1995 and then signed
   off 14 months later on his severance package, then valued at $140
   million.

   During Mr. Eisner's days on the stand, legal analysts expect him to try
   to justify both the hiring and firing of Mr. Ovitz. But he will need to
   walk a fine line, demonstrating that he did not merely hire Mr. Ovitz
   because he was a good friend and that while Mr. Ovitz's performance as
   president was flawed, it was not so egregious that he should have been
   fired for cause.

   On Monday, under questioning by his lawyer, Gary Naftalis, Mr. Eisner
   spent more than two hours describing the events that led to Mr. Ovitz's
   hiring. He said that he first met Mr. Ovitz when he was a young
   executive at the ABC network and Mr. Ovitz was an agent at William
   Morris, and the two became friendlier after Mr. Ovitz helped found
   Creative Artists, their families even vacationing together. "He was the
   most important person my age," Mr. Eisner said.

   Mr. Eisner also testified that he had tried to hire Mr. Ovitz several
   times, first to run the television division at Paramount Pictures in
   the early 1980's and then at Disney, which Mr. Eisner joined in 1984.

   After Frank G. Wells, Disney's former president and chief operating
   officer, died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Mr. Eisner approached Mr.
   Ovitz about that job during a plane ride to the Herb Allen conference
   of media and entertainment executives in Sun Valley, Idaho.

   "He was really impressive," said Mr. Eisner, referring to Mr. Ovitz's
   reputation as a top agent and his moves into other areas, including
   advertising.

   But Mr. Ovitz desired the title of co-chief executive of Disney, a
   notion Mr. Eisner rejected. Mr. Eisner recalled that as each of them
   were getting in their separate cars to drive to the conference, Mr.
   Ovitz yelled to Jane Eisner, Mr. Eisner's wife, "Tell him to do this
   because I'm going to save his life." Two days later, Mr. Eisner said,
   he had emergency bypass surgery.

   Negotiations became serious again in the spring of 1995, when Mr.
   Eisner said Mr. Ovitz told him that the Creative Artists Agency, by
   then a powerhouse in Hollywood, was discussing a transaction with Edgar
   Bronfman Jr. to join the television and film businesses of MCA Inc.,
   now part as NBC Universal. Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz asked Mr. Eisner
   to match his deal with Mr. Bronfman, and once again asked for the
   co-chief executive title. When Mr. Eisner said no, he said Mr. Ovitz
   "gave me a lecture on relationships."

   When the deal with Mr. Bronfman fell through, Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz
   was distraught. Mr. Eisner said, for his part, he saw an opportunity.
   Before the merger with ABC/Capital Cities announced in August 1995, Mr.
   Eisner said he told Mr. Ovitz about it to "whet his appetite." Within
   weeks of the merger's announcement, Mr. Ovitz agreed to become
   president of Disney.

   Mr. Eisner said he kept the board informed of those discussions. After
   Mr. Wells's death, Mr. Eisner said he discussed it with the investor
   Sid Bass, as well as with Roy E. Disney and Stanley P. Gold, who were
   board members at the time. Mr. Disney and Mr. Gold have since left the
   board and have campaigned to oust Mr. Eisner for the company's
   performance.

   But in his testimony on Monday morning, Mr. Disney said board members
   had not approved Mr. Ovitz's employment agreement before it was signed
   and were not given a breakdown of the value of the stock option plan.
   He added that he could not recall if board members were given
   comparable figures of executive pay at other companies.

   (Mr. Eisner said that Disney gave Mr. Ovitz five million stock options,
   two million of them dependent solely on Mr. Ovitz's renewing his
   contract. Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz had originally asked for eight
   million stock options.)

   Mr. Disney said Mr. Eisner had no doubts about hiring Mr. Ovitz. But
   within the company, there was a degree of unhappiness that built over
   time, he said. There was trouble within the first few weeks of Mr.
   Ovitz's joining, Mr. Disney said. He recalled that Mr. Ovitz was about
   15 minutes late for a weekly staff luncheon attended by 25 to 30
   people. "Oh, don't worry, he's always late," Mr. Disney said a
   colleague told him at the time. After noticing that the conversation
   froze as Mr. Ovitz arrived and that several executives displayed
   negative "body language" during the meeting, Mr. Disney said he had the
   impression that there was tension in the executive suite.

   Mr. Ovitz said Mr. Disney, too, appeared uncomfortable at times, and
   was in particular reticent to wave at a crowd when the two were in a
   parade together in New Orleans.

   Heart disease can strike with few warning signs
   By Steve Sternberg, USA TODAY
   Former president Bill Clinton has become one of 64 million Americans
   with diagnosed heart disease. As many as 4 million more have a "silent"
   illness with no symptoms to betray their risk, doctors say.
   [clear.gif]
   [clinton.jpg] [clear.gif] Quadruple bypass: Doctors said Bill Clinton
   had well over 90% blockage in some arteries. [clear.gif]
   By Stephan Savoia, AP

   Trouble is, no one can predict who will go on to have a major heart
   attack or a stroke, says Christopher White, chief of cardiology at the
   Ochsner Institute in New Orleans. "You can't ever look at a patient and
   say something's going to happen next Tuesday, but you can build a risk
   profile." (Graphic: Coronary bypass)

   Heart attacks are difficult to predict, because coronary artery
   disease, or hardening of the arteries, is a process "that gets worse
   with time. It grows in fits and spurts."
   [clear.gif]   How to spot trouble [clear.gif] [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]

   Bill Clinton's symptoms of progressive chest discomfort and shortness
   of breath were classic signs of heart disease. Yet Clinton waited so
   long to get help that doctors say he was courting a major heart attack.

   How do you tell when you're risking a heart attack?

   Christopher White, chief of cardiology at the Ochsner Institute in New
   Orleans, offers these tips:
   [bullet.gif] Chest discomfort from clogged arteries often worsens with
   activity and eases with rest. When the discomfort persists at rest,
   it's a sign that the heart isn't getting enough oxygen and a heart
   attack could be imminent.
   [bullet.gif] Chest "pain" isn't necessarily painful. It's more a
   feeling of pressure, of fullness, of a weight crushing on the chest. It
   can radiate up your left arm and shoulder to your jaw. Heart disease
   also is associated with shortness of breath and clamminess.
   [bullet.gif] Heartburn sometimes is mistaken for heart disease, but
   there are giveaways. Heartburn is caused by acid reflux, so you can
   often taste the acid in your throat. Also, heartburn usually occurs
   after a big meal or at night when you lie down. It doesn't get worse
   when you're climbing stairs.
   [bullet.gif] Up to 4 million people in the USA have "silent" heart
   disease, without symptoms.
   The Web site of the American Heart Association offers a free
   questionnaire to help gauge your risk at www.americanheart.org.
   [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]

   Artery blockages, called plaques, are fat-filled bulges that can cut
   off blood flow. The most dangerous plaques are the "hot" ones, bulges
   that have become irritated and inflamed. "When it ruptures, it grows
   suddenly. It will grow from a 30% to 80% (blockage) in five minutes.
   That's why somebody who yesterday was running in the park, playing with
   their kids, today is having a heart attack."

   Clinton was so unaware of his condition that he spent a day last week
   in New Orleans "eating New Orleans food. ... He was signing his book;
   he was fine," White says. "Something obviously happened to rupture that
   plaque, but the rupture didn't completely block the artery. If some
   blood gets through, you don't have a dead heart; you have a hurting
   heart."

   A person can determine personal risk with checklists available on the
   American Heart Association Web site, www.americanheart.org. The
   checklists calculate risk based on your answers to several questions,
   including diet, cholesterol levels, obesity, diabetes, blood pressure,
   smoking and age.

   "If you answer no to all those things, the chance you'll have problems
   is relatively small," White says. "If you answer yes to all of them,
   you're in big trouble. If you answer yes to a couple, we take you to
   the next level of testing."

   Those tests might include a simple finger-stick blood test
   forC-reactive protein, a telltale sign of inflammation in artery walls
   that often accompanies coronary artery disease. Doctors also often
   recommend treadmill stress tests, which use EKGs, echocardiography or
   nuclear imaging studies to gauge heart function.

   Sometimes doctors will recommend a $300 to $400 computed tomography
   scan that can detect calcium in artery walls, which is a sign of
   hardened arteries. If the test is negative, your arteries are clear.
   But a positive test generates more anxiety than information, White
   says. It doesn't necessarily mean your arteries are blocked; "it leads
   to more testing," he says.

   White calls whole-body CT scans a risky fad that exposes people to
   radiation levels similar to those absorbed by some survivors of
   Hiroshima.

   Someone with suspicious test results or severe symptoms may be
   scheduled for a coronary angiogram and possible angioplasty. A person
   having three or more clogged vessels, such as Clinton had, fares better
   with bypass surgery, doctors say.

   And prevention works best when it begins before disease sets in.
   "Chelsea ought to know what her cholesterol is. Her daddy had a bypass
   at 58," White says. "She should be screened now rather than waiting
   until she's 50."

   Russians bid Americans dasvedanya in U.S. Open women's semis
   By Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press
   NEW YORK — Fighting back from a disastrous start and winning the
   49-stroke point of the tournament along the way, Jennifer Capriati
   served for the match against Elena Dementieva in their U.S. Open
   semifinal Friday. Right where Capriati wanted to be, right? Nyet!

   [2004-09-10-inside-russians.jpg] [clear.gif] Elena Dementieva and
   Svetlana Kuznetsova gave their country a flashback to the all-Russian
   final at the French Open. [clear.gif]
   By David Duprey and Richard Drew, AP

   Up big but battling a leg injury, Lindsay Davenport just had to hold
   off first-time major semifinalist Svetlana Kuznetsova for a handful of
   games. Surely, Davenport could rely on her experience and powerful
   strokes to extend a 22-match winning streak and keep alive her bid for
   the No. 1 ranking, right? Nyet!

   Capriati came oh-so-close yet again at Flushing Meadow before falling
   to 0-4 in Open semifinals, succumbing to the soft-as-cotton-candy
   serves and hard-nosed grit of an ailing Dementieva 6-0, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).

   Davenport, limping on a bad hip, devolved from near perfection in the
   first set and a 3-0 lead in the third to a 1-6, 6-2, 6-4 loss to
   Kuznetsova.

   By beating the crowd favorites in topsy-turvy matches, No. 6 Dementieva
   and No. 9 Kuznetsova became the first Russian women to reach a U.S.
   Open final. As of four months ago, no Russian woman ever won a Grand
   Slam title; now the country will have its third straight major
   champion.

   Anastasia Myskina beat Dementieva for the French Open title and Maria
   Sharapova won Wimbledon.

   "I guess they're just pretty hungry to play, and there's just so many
   of them," Capriati said. "And there's also a few good ones — I mean,
   all of them are good."

   It's the first time since 1988 that no Americans will be in the Open's
   singles finals. In the men's semifinals Saturday afternoon, top-ranked
   Roger Federer of Switzerland plays No. 5 Tim Henman of Britain, and
   2001 U.S. Open champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia faces No. 28
   Joachim Johansson of Sweden, who upset defending champ Andy Roddick in
   the quarterfinals.

   Federer is bidding to become the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988
   to win three majors in a year. There's no such dominant figure in
   women's tennis these days — indeed, Amelie Mauresmo will be No. 1 in
   the rankings without having won a Slam in her career — but there is a
   dominant nation.

   "It really surprises me as much as it surprises you," said Dementieva,
   so wiped out after outlasting Capriati that she pulled out of the
   doubles semifinals. "There are a lot of us, and we play very good. But
   to see another all-Russian final in a Grand Slam, that's amazing. It's
   unbelievable to me."

   And probably to the executives at CBS, which is paying millions for the
   right to air the weekend's matches, including the women's prime-time
   final Saturday.

   For the first time in the Open era, which dates to 1968, none of the
   four top-seeded women made the semis in New York. That seemed to clear
   the way for Davenport and Capriati — both 28, former No. 1s, and owners
   of three Slams each — to get to the title match.

   After all, Kuznetsova, 19, was best known until now as Martina
   Navratilova's former doubles partner. Dementieva, 22, was in just her
   third major semifinal, injured her left groin during the week, needed
   IV fluids after beating Mauresmo in the fourth round, and her
   infamously slow serves (around 60 mph) solicit laughter from
   spectators.

   But, as Dementiva's coach, Olga Morazova, put it: "At the end, Elena
   was tougher."

   Morazova lost to Chris Evert in the 1974 French Open and Wimbledon
   finals, the last time a Russian woman played for a Slam title until the
   recent run.

   Capriati is building a forgettable body of work in U.S. Open
   semifinals. She's now served for a spot in the final a total of five
   times dating to 1991, always getting broken. Last year, she served for
   it twice against Justine Henin-Hardenne and 10 times was two points
   from victory. This time, she finally converted her eighth break chance
   over two games to get to 6-5 in the third set. But Capriati
   double-faulted to send it to a tiebreaker, which Dementieva ended with
   a backhand winner down the line.

   At least Capriati made it competitive. She was absolutely awful in the
   17-minute first set, losing 24 of 29 points and hitting zero winners.
   Early in the second set, she let her frustration show, motioning at her
   family in the guest box, hammering a ball against the wall, asking the
   chair umpire to turn off her mike so it wouldn't pick up the loud sound
   of the wind.

   When someone barked out advice from the stands, Capriati snapped: "Shut
   up! I know what to do!"

   Apparently, she did, and the third set had its great moments and its
   ridiculous ones — including a combined eight breaks of serve in 12
   games. But on the set's third point, the players engaged in a 49-stroke
   exchange that featured fantastic defense by Capriati. When it finally
   ended with Dementieva missing an easy overhead, Capriati dropped her
   racket and raised her arms, while the Russian bent over, hands on
   knees. While both stopped to catch their breath, the fans responded
   with a standing ovation.

   Two games later, Capriati — whose victory over Serena Williams in the
   quarterfinals was marked by officiating errors — got flustered when
   chair umpire Leann White mistakenly announced the score at 30-all.
   White corrected herself, saying Dementieva led 40-15, and Capriati
   shouted, "You can't change it now!" White responded, and Capriati fired
   off an expletive, drawing a warning.

   Davenport hurt her left hip while practicing in the morning, and while
   she was superb in the first set, she had a hitch in her step late in
   the second. She left the court to get the area rewrapped and won the
   first three games of the third set. Then she dropped six of the last
   seven games. Davenport just watched a backhand by Kuznetsova fly by to
   get broken to 5-4, then allowed the Russian to serve it out at love.

   At Wimbledon, Davenport talked about retiring at season's end. She
   didn't lose again until Friday, then said she's not sure about her
   future.

   "I'm just going to see how I feel in the next few weeks, and how my
   body feels, and mentally how I feel, and what my motivation is,''
   Davenport said. ''It would be tough to walk away knowing that, 'Oh, I
   still could have won a Slam,' or 'I was still at the top.' That
   probably makes it a little bit more challenging of a decision."

   Usher leads American Music Award noms
   LOS ANGELES (AP) — R&B casanova Usher, whose album Confessions steamed
   up the charts with songs about sex, affairs and breakups, received a
   leading four nominations Tuesday for the American Music Awards.

   Many categories included last year's winners — Toby Keith, Tim McGraw
   and Linkin Park — and previous nominees Beyonce, Avril Lavigne, Norah
   Jones and R. Kelly. (Related item: American Music Award nominee list)

   Meanwhile, rapper-producer Kanye West, whose album The College Dropout
   combines gospel, rap and braggadocio, had three nominations, the second
   most after Usher.

   Usher was nominated as favorite male artist in both the pop/rock and
   soul/R&B categories, and his Confessions also has best album bids in
   both groups.

   In the hip-hop/rap class, West was up for favorite male artist, The
   College Dropout got a mention for best album, and his third bid came
   for the cross-genre award as best newcomer.

   Two categories feature all of the same nominees as last year. The
   country male artist group again includes Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson,
   Toby Keith, Tim McGraw (who won in 2003). It also was deja vu for
   contemporary inspirational music, as 2003 winner Steven Curtis Chapman
   competes once more against MercyMe and Third Day.

   Meanwhile, OutKast — the big winner at February's Grammys — was
   nominated for best rap/hip-hop group, and its Grammy-winning
   Speakerboxxx/The Love Below got a bid for best rap album.

   The awards will be presented during a Nov. 14 ceremony that will be
   shown live on ABC. Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel will host it.

   The nominations are based on sales figures and radio play. Winners are
   selected by a survey of about 20,000 listeners.

   British man shot dead in Riyadh worked for communications company
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — A Briton who was shot dead outside a Saudi
   shopping center has been identified as an employee of the
   communications company Marconi.
   [clear.gif]
   [inside-saudi-killing.jpg] [clear.gif] A British man was killed here in
   the latest attack on a Westerner in the kingdom. [clear.gif]
   AFP

   The victim was shot near the Max discount shopping center in the
   eastern part of the Saudi capital. A ministry spokesman gave no further
   details.

   Earlier, Saudi-owned TV station Al-Arabiya said the man was shot four
   times while in the shopping center's car park.

   Police ringed the area looking for the killer while an ambulance
   removed the victim's body.

   A British diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he heard
   about the report but could not confirm that a British citizen was
   killed.

   There has been a spate of attacks against foreigners in Saudi Arabia by
   militants bent on hurting the economy of the world's largest oil
   producer. That sector, in particular, depends on foreigners.

   In May, two Britons were among six Westerners killed by militants who
   sprayed gunfire inside an oil contractor's office in Yanbu, 220 miles
   north of the Red Sea port of Jiddah.

   Later that month, a Briton was among 22 people killed during a hostage
   siege in Khobar, an oil hub 250 miles northeast of Riyadh.

   A British Broadcasting Corp. reporter, Frank Gardner, was shot and
   seriously wounded in Riyadh in June. His Irish colleague was killed in
   that attack.

   On Saturday, an explosion rocked Jiddah near a branch of the
   Saudi-American bank.

   The Gulf kingdom has been hunting al-Qaeda-linked militants behind a
   series of bombings and shootings targeting the U.S.-allied Saudi
   regime, security authorities and foreign interests.

   Senators ask Bush to rethink Iraq policies
   WASHINGTON (AP) — Senators from both parties urged the Bush
   administration on Sunday to make a realistic assessment of the
   situation in Iraq and adjust its policies aimed at pacifying the
   country.
   [clear.gif]
   [mccain-iraq-policies-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] Sen. John McCain,
   R-Ariz., who has campaigned often with the president, said mistakes in
   Iraq generally can be attributed to inadequate manpower. [clear.gif]
   By Jim Cole, AP

   But Bush readied a firm defense of his Iraq policy — and a sharp new
   attack on rival John Kerry's stance — for a speech Monday.

   "The fact is a crisp, sharp analysis of our policies is required. We
   didn't do that in Vietnam, and we saw 11 years of casualties mount to
   the point where we finally lost," said Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam War
   veteran who is co-chairman of President Bush's re-election committee in
   Nebraska.

   "We can't lose this. It is too important," Hagel, R-Neb., said on CBS'
   Face the Nation.

   A major problem, said leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations
   Committee, was incompetence by the administration in reconstructing the
   country's shattered infrastructure.

   The chairman, Sen. Richard Lugar, noted that Congress appropriated
   $18.4 billion a year ago this week for reconstruction. No more than $1
   billion has been spent. "This is the incompetence in the
   administration," Lugar, R-Ind., said on ABC's This Week.

   "Exactly right," interjected Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, the
   committee's top Democrat. He said later: "This has been incompetence so
   far. Five% of the $18.4 billion that George Bush keeps ... beating the
   other candidate up and about the head for how he voted and didn't vote,
   and he's released 5%."

   Sen. John McCain, who has campaigned often with the president, said
   mistakes in Iraq generally can be attributed to inadequate manpower.
   McCain, R-Ariz., said problems began arising shortly after the dash
   through the desert to take Baghdad, the capital, in April 2003.

   "We made serious mistakes right after the initial successes by not
   having enough troops on the ground, by allowing the looting, by not
   securing the borders," McCain said.

   "Airstrikes don't do it; artillery doesn't do it. Boots on the ground
   do it," McCain told Fox News Sunday.

   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said Bush had pointed out from the beginning
   that the risks of combat in Iraq.

   "I find it shocking that some people are surprised by the fact that it
   is a long and difficult conflict," Kyl said.

   "What's important is that you have a leader who recognizes that there
   are difficulties, but who is committed to prevailing; who has a firm
   idea of what he wants to accomplish, confidence in his commanders in
   the field, and who doesn't send mixed messages to the troops or to our
   allies, or most importantly, to our enemies," Kyl said.

   Bush planned to use that line of attack against Kerry on Monday,
   seeking to counter increasingly hard-hitting language the Massachusetts
   senator has been using on Bush's Iraq policy.

   In a speech in New Hampshire, Bush "will step up his critique of John
   Kerry's policy on Iraq of retreat and defeat," said Bush campaign
   spokesman Scott Stanzel. "Our troops deserve better than to hear
   Kerry's campaign pushing pessimism and lack of faith in the mission."

   Kerry too was ratcheting up his attacks on Bush and Iraq, in a speech
   to be delivered at New York University. The Democrat "will lay out his
   plan for cleaning up the mess George Bush has made in Iraq," said
   campaign spokesman Phil Singer.

   Bush's campaign also was airing a new TV commercial promoting his
   broader anti-terror efforts.

   "President Bush and our leaders in Congress have a plan," an announcer
   says. Among the items listed on the ad are beefing up border and port
   security, reorganizing the intelligence services, renewing the Patriot
   Act, and giving the military "all it needs."

   Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., acknowledged that the situation may
   deteriorate further before it gets better as antidemocratic forces try
   to prevent democracy from taking hold.

   "So this is not a civil war. This is a part of the war on terror, where
   the terrorists have gone to Iraq, and we need to fight back or we'll
   lose the region," Graham told CNN's Late Edition.

   McCain was asked about a report in Sunday's New York Times that U.S.
   commanders were planning a drive in November or December to retake
   areas where insurgents have won control. Such a timetable would place
   the operations after the Nov. 2 election for the White House.

   McCain said Bush was not being "as straight as we would want him to be"
   about the situation. "The longer we delay with these sanctuaries, the
   more difficult the challenge is going to be and the more casualties we
   will incur and the Iraqi people will suffer because they will be able
   to operate out of these sanctuaries obviously now with somewhat of
   impunity," McCain said.

   Phelps, fellow Olympians swimming again
   By Vicki Michaelis, USA TODAY
   INDIANAPOLIS — Michael Phelps has reached the stratosphere of sports
   stardom: He's on a first-name basis with fans.

   "People come up to me and say, 'Are you Michael?' " Phelps said
   Wednesday at Conseco Fieldhouse, where the short-course world swimming
   championships begin today in a temporary pool built on the arena floor.

   The problem with being held in such esteem — as another famous Michael,
   last name Jordan, likely would tell Phelps — is that notoriety comes
   with the highest of expectations.

   Every time Phelps, who won eight medals at the Athens Olympics, touches
   a starting block now, the American sports public will assume he can
   turn the race into gold.

   But at the short-course worlds, where Phelps plans to swim in five
   individual events, gold medals won't be a given. His life since the
   Olympics has been a string of appearances rather than a steady diet of
   training laps, and short-course swimming isn't his strong suit. Phelps
   went to Athens with the stated goal of winning one gold medal. He won
   six golds and two bronzes. For this meet, he hasn't voiced any personal
   expectations.

   "Just having the opportunity to swim in front of a home crowd is the
   most important thing," he said.

   Several other U.S. Olympians, including Jenny Thompson and backstroke
   king Aaron Peirsol, interrupted their post-Olympic rest to swim at
   home.

   "It's more of a mental thing than a physical thing," said Peirsol, who
   won three gold medals in Athens. "After the Olympics there's a tendency
   (to think) you've done it and what can top that."

   Thompson, the most decorated U.S. Olympian with 12 medals, has said
   this meet is her last. Next week, she returns to medical school at
   Columbia University.

   "I'm going to approach this meet as I would any other — I want to do my
   best," said Thompson, who is entered in the 50 freestyle and 50 and 100
   butterfly.

   Phelps does his best in long-course meets (held in 50-meter pools) such
   as the Olympics, not 25-meter pools.

   "In short course there are more turns, which aren't really my forte,"
   Phelps said.

   Phelps tends to build his speed throughout a race, Australian swim
   coach Leigh Nugent noted. That is difficult to do in 25-meter pools,
   where the 400-meter individual medley — usually one of Phelps'
   strongest events — requires 15 turns instead of seven.

   "If you're not a very good turner, the momentum's going to be hard to
   keep going throughout the race," Phelps said.

   Phelps will compete in the 100, 200 and 400 individual medleys, as well
   as the 200 free and 200 fly. He's also likely to swim in up to three
   relays.

   For the last month, Phelps has been on a cross-country tour with U.S.
   Olympic teammates Ian Crocker and Lenny Krayzelburg. Phelps hasn't swum
   more than 5,000 meters in a day, a mark he often meets or surpasses in
   regular training.

   "You can get by in short course with a lot less conditioning than long
   course," said Phelps' coach, Bob Bowman.

   Fans of "Michael" will have to hope that holds true over the next five
   days.

   Israeli missile strike in northern Gaza kills civilian
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli aircraft fired a missile at
   Palestinian gunmen in the Jebaliya refugee camp after nightfall Sunday,
   wounding eight, in the second airstrike of the day.

   By Kevin Frayer, AP

   Hospital officials said two of the wounded were in critical condition.
   Palestinian security officials said the target of the missile was some
   gunmen organizing an attack on Israeli troops. Israeli military sources
   said the airstrike was aimed at Palestinians planting a bomb.

   Large numbers of Israeli troops and tanks have been operating in
   northern Gaza for nearly two weeks, trying to stop militants from
   firing rockets at nearby Israeli towns.

   Earlier Sunday, Israeli aircraft fired a missile at a home near a Hamas
   stronghold in the Jebaliya refugee camp, killing one civilian and
   wounding eight, including a young girl, hospital officials said.

   It was not clear why the army targeted the house, which was not far
   from the Kholfa Mosque, a Hamas power base. The army did not comment.

   The strike caused extensive damage to nearby homes and stores,
   witnesses said.

   Also Sunday, a Palestinian gunman wounded earlier in the army's
   offensive died in the hospital, officials said.

   The two deaths brought the number of Palestinians killed in the
   operation to 96. Almost half of those killed were civilians, and 18
   were under age 17, Palestinian officials said.

   Also in Jebaliya on Sunday, an Israeli soldier was slightly wounded by
   an anti-tank missile fired by Palestinians, the military said.

   The offensive began Sept. 29 and was expanded after militants launched
   a homemade rocket into the Israeli town of Sderot, killing two
   children, later that day. The raid was intended to stop militants from
   launching the rockets into Israel, though the attacks have continued.

   Army Radio reported Sunday that an army officer had been arrested on
   suspicion of selling forged entry permits to Palestinians. The report
   did not identify the lieutenant colonel, but said he could be charged
   with endangering state security. The military had no comment on the
   report.

   Israel's government tightly controls the entry of Palestinians into
   Israel with roadblocks, checkpoints and a system of work permits,
   saying restrictions are needed to stop Palestinian bombers and other
   attackers from getting in.

   Even Palestinians with work permits — about 15,000 — are banned from
   entering Israel now. Israel imposed a total closure a month ago, at the
   beginning of the Jewish holiday season.

   The military said Sunday the ban would remain in effect until further
   notice, though the last holiday last week.

   380 tons of high explosives missing in Iraq
   By Dave Moniz, USA TODAY
   WASHINGTON — The head of the United Nations' nuclear inspection arm
   told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that nearly 380 tons of
   high-grade explosives that could be used in nuclear bombs or terrorist
   weapons are missing from a storage facility in Iraq.

   The explosives, known as HMX and RDX, are some of the most powerful
   conventional explosives used by the world's militaries. They were
   stored at a weapons complex at Al Qaqaa, about 30 miles south of
   Baghdad. The site was never secured by U.S. forces following their
   rapid movement across Iraq in March and April 2003. (Audio: Spokesman
   confirms missing explosives)

   The apparent theft of the materials was first reported in Monday's New
   York Times. (Related list: Missing explosives)

   Mohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the International Atomic Energy
   Agency, notified the Security Council on Monday, two weeks after
   informing U.S. officials that the materials were missing. Before the
   war, the explosives were being monitored by the IAEA because they can
   be used in nuclear bombs to trigger a nuclear explosion.

   The disappearance of the high explosives is the latest and perhaps most
   striking evidence of Saddam Hussein's immense prewar stockpile of
   conventional weapons and the failure by the U.S. military and its
   allies to secure those weapons during the rush to topple Saddam's
   regime and in the chaotic aftermath of that initial campaign.

   The explosives constitute a fraction of the conventional weapons that
   were scattered across Iraq at storage sites, at ammo dumps and in
   non-military stashes.

   Since the end of the major combat phase of the Iraq war on May 1, 2003,
   the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has destroyed 178,000 tons of
   munitions and secured an additional 150,000 tons.

   But weapons experts say that if insurgents or terrorists obtain some or
   all of the missing materials, they could use the explosives against
   targets in Iraq and the United States or sell them to groups or
   countries trying to build nuclear weapons.

   Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry blasted the Bush
   administration's handling of the Iraq occupation during an appearance
   in New Hampshire. Kerry said the administration was warned that
   terrorists might be helping themselves to explosives but did nothing.
   "This is one of the great blunders of Iraq," he said.

   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Monday that "President Bush
   wants to make sure we get to the bottom of this." He said the United
   States has secured more than 10,000 munitions caches since invading
   Iraq. He dismissed Kerry's comments and said the Democratic nominee
   "has a strategy for retreat and defeat in Iraq."

   A number of Iraqi facilities were looted after the invasion, according
   to IAEA officials. Among the items presumed missing are precision
   machinery that could be used to build nuclear weapons.

   Many details about how the weapons disappeared remained uncertain
   Monday. It was unclear when they were taken or whether they have fallen
   into the hands of insurgents in Iraq. Capt. Harold Pittman, a spokesman
   for U.S. Central Command, said he could not say whether any of the
   missing explosives have been used in attacks against U.S. or allied
   troops

   Paul Leventhal, founding president of the Nuclear Control Institute in
   Washington, D.C., said he fears the explosives were taken by Baath
   Party insurgents and are already being used against U.S. troops or kept
   in reserve in the event of civil war in Iraq.

   Another, darker possibility, Leventhal said, is that the explosives
   were removed by those "who might retain the capacity to assemble a
   nuclear weapon."

   Dan Goure, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington,
   Va., said the disappearance of the explosives was another sign of how
   overwhelmed the U.S. military was after the fall of Saddam's regime.

   "It was in keeping with what we saw in Iraq almost from day one," Goure
   said, noting the large amounts of weapons that U.S. and allied troops
   were unable to secure from looters.

   Bush, Kerry sparring over troops in Iraq
   By Judy Keen and Jill Lawrence, USA TODAY
   SAGINAW, Mich. — President Bush and Sen. John Kerry continued a
   bruising series of attacks on each other's ability to serve as
   commander in chief Thursday as the presidential race entered the final
   weekend of campaigning.
   [clear.gif]

   in Dayton, Ohio. The state is a must-win for Bush and Democratic
   challenger John Kerry. [clear.gif]
   By Tim Sloan, AFP

   As they traveled through a handful of closely fought Midwestern
   battleground states — Kerry in the company of rock icon Bruce
   Springsteen — Bush and Kerry traded barbs about the disclosure this
   week that nearly 400 tons of explosives are missing in Iraq.

   "This week Sen. Kerry is again attacking the actions of our military in
   Iraq, with complete disregard for the facts," Bush said in Saginaw.
   "Sen. Kerry will say anything to get elected. The senator's willingness
   to trade principle for political convenience makes it clear that John
   Kerry is the wrong man for the wrong job at the wrong time."

   The Bush campaign released a new television ad, No Limit, to underline
   the president's theme. It ends with the line: "Apparently there really
   is nothing John Kerry won't say."

   Kerry hammered on the explosives issue as evidence of yet another
   administration misstep in Iraq. At a rally in a school gym in Toledo,
   Ohio, Kerry tried to use Bush's words against him, saying he agrees
   with the president's charge that "a presidential candidate who jumps to
   conclusions without knowing the facts is not a person you want to be
   commander in chief."

   Kerry said Bush himself is guilty of just that failing because he
   didn't anticipate the resistance U.S. forces have encountered in Iraq.

   The president "not only jumped to conclusions, he ignored the facts
   that he was given by his generals, by the Congress, by the experts,"
   Kerry said.

   Kerry also savaged Bush's recent attempt to compare himself to
   President John Kennedy.

   "When the Bay of Pigs went sour, John Kennedy had the courage to look
   America in the eye and say, 'I take responsibility,' " Kerry said,
   referring to the failed invasion of Cuba in 1961. "Mr. President, it's
   long since time for you to start taking responsibility for the mistakes
   you made."

   Kerry's campaign released a new television ad, Your Hands, that
   summarizes his views on issues ranging from health care to job
   creation.

   With most polls showing dead heats nationally and in crucial electoral
   battlegrounds, Bush and Kerry tried to use every tool at their disposal
   to motivate their party base to turn out Tuesday as well as to woo any
   still uncommitted voters.

   Bush campaigned in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin on the heels of a rally
   in Pontiac, Mich., on Wednesday night that drew close to 20,000
   supporters. Meanwhile, in Schofield, Wis., Vice President Cheney said
   Kerry was "dead wrong" about the explosives issue.

   As Bush and Cheney toured the Midwest, Republican surrogates were
   flooding the airwaves to speak on their behalf.

   California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will appear with Bush today in
   Columbus, Ohio. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, appearing on NBC's
   Today, prompted Democratic criticism when he said that troops in Iraq,
   not Bush, bore the ultimate responsibility for securing the explosives.

   Countered Sen. John Edwards in Duluth, Minn.: "Our men and women in
   uniform did their job. George Bush didn't do his job."

   The centerpiece of Kerry's day, which included appearances in Ohio and
   Wisconsin, was a massive rally in Madison, Wis., with Springsteen —
   composer of No Surrender, Kerry's campaign theme song.

   Local fire department officials said the event drew more than 80,000
   people along four square blocks and side streets stretching from the
   Capitol.

   Springsteen, who joined Kerry at a later rally in Ohio, said Kerry
   honors principles such as economic justice, healing the sick, housing
   the homeless, protecting the environment and pursuing responsible
   foreign policy.

   "This is for you, John," he said, and sang a solo version of No
   Surrender.

   Keen reported from the Bush campaign; Lawrence from the Kerry campaign.

Opposition demands new Ukraine vote

   By - The Washington Times - Friday, November 26, 2004

   KIEV — Opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko yesterday demanded a new
   presidential election be held after a face-to-face meeting with rival
   Viktor Yanukovych failed to resolve Ukraine’s bitter weeklong political
   standoff.

   Turning up the heat on the government-backed Mr. Yanukovych, Mr.
   Yushchenko told cheering supporters after the nearly three-hour meeting
   he opposed a proposal to refer charges of massive fraud in Sunday’s
   election to the Supreme Court.
   [INS: :INS]

   “We will only hold talks on staging a new vote,” Mr. Yushchenko said.

   Moments earlier, outgoing President Leonid Kuchma announced he would
   preside over a working group, including key European envoys who have
   converged on Kiev, to seek a solution to the crisis and head off
   growing fears of violence.

   Massive streets protests and charges of fraud in the Nov. 21 vote have
   roiled this strategically placed country, the largest state to break
   from Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and put Moscow
   and Washington on a collision course over Ukraine’s future.

   In Crawford, Texas, President Bush warned yesterday the world “is
   watching very closely” as Ukraine tries to sort through the fraud
   charges.

   U.S. and European Union officials contend that massive fraud marred the
   presidential runoff election, in which Mr. Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow
   prime minister, narrowly edged Mr. Yushchenko. Ukraine’s Supreme Court
   ordered election officials not to publish the results until an appeal
   is heard on Monday.

   Ukraine’s parliament is also set to meet today to consider the disputed
   election and what to do next. Lawmakers cannot overturn last Sunday’s
   vote, but could have an effect on the court hearing next week.

   “There’s just a lot of allegations of vote fraud that placed the result
   of the election in doubt,” Mr. Bush said. “… People are paying very
   close attention to this and, hopefully, it will be resolved in a way
   that brings credit and confidence to the Ukrainian government.”

   Russian President Vladimir Putin all but endorsed Mr. Yanukovych before
   the vote and congratulated the prime minister on his apparent victory.

   The Russian foreign ministry yesterday hinted it may support a re-run
   of the election, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov again
   questioned the motives of Western governments in the crisis.

   “In some European capitals, there are some forces that are attempting
   to draw some new border lines across Europe,” Mr. Lavrov said.

   Mr. Yushchenko warned he would fight any stalling tactics by his
   opponent.

   “If we see that Viktor Yanukovych is playing for time, we are going to
   take active measures,” he told supporters. “If a decision isn’t reached
   in one or two days, it means that Viktor Yanukovych doesn’t hear you.”

   The challenger demanded a new election on Dec. 12, the creation of a
   new central election commission and equal access to the press for both
   candidates.

A Sex Scandal in Trenton, and a Puzzle for Detectives

By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

Published: August 22, 2004

   TRENTON, Aug. 20 - As federal agents investigate Gov. James E.
   McGreevey's accusation that a former adviser tried to extort millions
   of dollars by threatening to disclose their extramarital affair
   publicly, the basic outlines of the case are not in dispute.

   Lawyers for Mr. McGreevey and his former aide, Golan Cipel, had dozens
   of telephone conversations to discuss Mr. Cipel's plan to pursue a
   sexual harassment and assault lawsuit against the governor and a
   possible financial agreement in the case before any papers were filed
   in court. The two sides met face to face at least twice in New York
   City.

   On Aug. 12, just minutes before Mr. McGreevey revealed the affair and
   announced his resignation, a lawyer who said he was an emissary from
   Mr. Cipel called Mr. McGreevey's aides and offered to drop the matter
   if the governor would approve a new medical school in New Jersey. Mr.
   Cipel had once worked as a media consultant for the medical school.

   But much is unknown about the interplay between lawyers for Mr. Cipel,
   who portrays himself as the victim of Mr. McGreevey's unwelcome
   advances, and the governor, whose political career and public identity
   were crashing around him. So as federal authorities focus on an
   investigation they call serious, they must determine whether the tone
   and substance of those conversations add up to a shakedown attempt or
   just a particularly heated and high-stakes legal negotiation.

   By filing a complaint, however, Mr. McGreevey and his legal team have
   opened the door for United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie to
   delve into whatever allegations of wrongdoing Mr. Cipel might level at
   his former boss. Mr. Christie is an aggressive prosecutor who has
   already brought corruption charges against several of the governor's
   fund-raisers and former aides.

   Some Democratic Party leaders are concerned that Mr. Christie, often
   mentioned as a Republican candidate for governor next year, might
   obtain leads that quickly transform Mr. McGreevey from the
   investigation's complaining witness to its target.

   But State Senator Raymond Lesniak, who has been Mr. McGreevey's
   confidant during the tumultuous past month, said the governor had
   nothing to fear from Mr. Cipel.

   "I'll take Golan Cipel's deposition myself," Mr. Lesniak declared in an
   interview Friday. "He's got nothing on Jim McGreevey. He's got nothing
   at all."

   Because the case will turn on the comparative credibility of Mr. Cipel
   and Mr. McGreevey, investigators will search for any evidence to
   corroborate their starkly opposing accounts. Mr. Cipel's lawyer, Allen
   M. Lowy, said that, contrary to published reports, he never threatened
   to reveal videotapes of the encounters involving Mr. Cipel and the
   governor, because no such tapes exist. (Mr. McGreevey's aides also say
   that there was never any threat to reveal videotapes.)

   Mr. Lowy and Rachel Yosevitz, his co-counsel on the case, insist,
   however, that there are witnesses who can back up his claims, although
   they have declined to name them or discuss how they might support Mr.
   Cipel's allegations. Mr. McGreevey's advisers have also declined to say
   whether they have any documentary evidence, like notes or dinner
   receipts, to support the governor's description of his relationship
   with Mr. Cipel as a consensual affair.

   That leaves investigators trying to sort through two versions of events
   that directly contradict each other in several crucial ways. Mr.
   McGreevey's lawyers and an investigator involved in the case say that
   there are no tapes of the discussions between the two sides, which
   would help them sort through the different accounts.

   Mr. McGreevey's lawyers say that Mr. Lowy asked for money from the very
   beginning of their discussions, bragging that he could win a $50
   million settlement in the case and demanding $5 million to drop it.

   Mr. Lowy insists that Mr. McGreevey's advisers first raised the issue
   of money and discussed the possible amounts by raising a series of
   hypothetical questions: "They asked, 'How much do you think you can get
   for this from a jury? Five thousand? Five-hundred thousand? Five
   million? Fifty million?' "

   Mr. Lowy said that the governor and his legal team also tried to
   intimidate Mr. Cipel into silence, warning that his reputation would be
   destroyed if he pursued his complaint, then sending a staff member to
   knock on his door, and to leave a note on his car.

   Mr. Lowy denied that he had threatened anyone during the discussions,
   but also said that he was shocked when the governor announced his
   resignation, because he thought the two sides had agreed in principle
   on a seven-figure settlement.

   But Mr. McGreevey's lawyers said they had never made a settlement
   offer, and had no intention of paying Mr. Cipel because his lawyers
   never revealed the basis of his complaint. After the governor decided
   to step down, but five hours before he announced his resignation, his
   lawyer, William Lawler, called the F.B.I. to file an extortion
   complaint.

   Legal experts say that point could be a pivotal factor in determining
   whether Mr. Cipel's claim was a legitimate attempt at a settlement or
   an attempt at extortion. A lawyer from West Trenton, John S. Furlong,
   said that in harassment cases, the burden of proof was on the person
   filing the complaint.

   "You've got to put your cards on the table; otherwise you're not
   looking for a settlement but a payoff," Mr. Furlong said.

British official rejects abuse-of-office rumors

Home secretary denies he sped up a visa application to help his ex-lover

   BETH GARDINER, Associated Press

   LONDON - Britain's top law enforcement official is mired in a messy
   scandal with all the ingredients of a big political headache â a
   married lover, a reported paternity dispute and now accusations he
   helped secure a speedy visa for his former lover's Filipina nanny.

   Home Secretary David Blunkett insisted Wednesday that he'd done nothing
   wrong, rejecting a newspaper report that his department's immigration
   division gave the nanny a British residency visa just 19 days after
   telling her it could take a year to process.

   The allegations surrounding Blunkett's three-year relationship with
   married magazine publisher Kimberly Quinn, which reportedly ended this
   summer, have been splashed across British front pages for days,
   apparently fed by leaks from both sides.

   Among the more salacious reports is that Blunkett is seeking DNA tests
   to prove he is the father of the pregnant Quinn's 2-year-old son and
   the child she is now carrying. The home secretary has not responded to
   that report.

   Quinn, who reportedly began the affair with Blunkett nine weeks after
   embarking on her second marriage, has been hospitalized for stress.

   Blunkett, who is divorced, has set up an independent investigation to
   examine the most serious charge â that he used his influence to
   fast-track the visa application of Leoncia Casalme, Quinn's nanny.
   Prime Minister Tony Blair says he's standing behind his tough-minded
   ally and is confident Blunkett will be cleared.

   "I've done nothing wrong," the home secretary said Wednesday. "I
   wouldn't have requested myself on Sunday the review if I thought there
   was any doubt whatsoever about what I'd done, my integrity and my
   openness. I have spent 34 years in politics ... building people's
   trust. I don't intend to throw it away."

   Blunkett's latest woes began in August, when his relationship with
   Quinn, an American who is publisher of the conservative Spectator
   magazine, became public. The trouble turned more serious Sunday, when
   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that he helped facilitate
   permanent residency status for Casalme.

   The Daily Mail newspaper also said it had obtained two letters that the
   Home Office sent to the nanny last year. The first told her the visa
   application could take up to a year; the second, 19 days later, said
   her application had been approved.

   Blunkett said the documents were authentic but "they prove absolutely
   nothing." He said his department was expediting a "very large number of
   documents" at the time.

   The Home Office said that in the backlog-clearing period before the
   imposition of an application fee in August 2003, "It was not unusual
   for straightforward cases to be dealt with within a few weeks."

   Blunkett, 57, born into a working-class family, overcame blindness to
   work his way up the political ladder, evolving from a socialist to a
   middle-of-the-road stalwart in Blair's government. Divorced for 14
   years, he has three grown sons.

   Quinn, in her early 40s, had a privileged upbringing in Los Angeles.
   After schooling at Vassar, then Oxford, she began her publishing career
   as an assistant to Helen Gurley Brown at Cosmopolitan.

   Truckers defy Kathmandu blockade

   Traders in Kathmandu
   Citizens are still concerned over shortages and price rises

   More lorry drivers are defying the indefinite Maoist blockade of
   Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, which is entering its fourth day.

   Lorries are bringing in essential supplies, although local residents
   say it is not enough, with food becoming scarcer and pricier.

   The Maoists, who are fighting for a communist republic, are imposing
   the blockade through fear of reprisals.

   Separately, a senior policeman was shot dead by suspected rebels on
   Saturday.

   There are also unconfirmed reports from some Maoist sources that the
   rebels are preparing to expand their blockade from next Saturday to
   cover the only land route into Tibet.

   Motorcycle gunmen

   The BBC's Navin Singh Khadka in Kathmandu says there has been an
   increase in the movement of both passenger and cargo vehicles into the
   capital after escorts and security personnel were provided.

   About 200 vehicles came through the key Nag Dhunga gate, west of
   Kathmandu, on Saturday morning, a significant rise on the first day of
   the blockade.

   Citizens are still worried about basic goods but supply ministry
   official, Dinesh Chandra Pyakurel, said: "There is no situation for
   panic yet."

   Nepal's Maoist rebels
   The Maoists are demanding the release of colleagues

   He told the Reuters news agency the capital had stocks of petrol for 10
   days, diesel for 30 and kerosene for three weeks.

   Adding to citizens' concerns is an increase in violence.

   On Saturday a senior police official was killed by motorcycle gunmen on
   the outskirts of Kathmandu.

   A home ministry official said: "He died on the way to hospital. We
   believe the killers are Maoists."

   Another policeman was seriously injured in an attack in the capital on
   Friday.

   There were also two explosions in Kathmandu and the neighbouring
   Bhaktapur district on Friday.

   The rebels say they will maintain their blockade indefinitely until
   detained comrades are released and the killing of others is
   investigated.

   The government said it would investigate what happened to a number of
   left-wing activists who have disappeared over the past few months.

   But Information Minister Mohammad Mohsin also said the government would
   not bow to Maoist pressure.

   The Maoists have been engaged in an armed struggle since 1996 to
   replace the monarchy.

   About 9,000 people have died in violence between the rebels and
   security forces since then.

   Italian troops 'to stay in Iraq'

   Enzo Baldoni, photographed at a Red Cross camp in Najaf on 19 August
   Baldoni has not been heard of since last week when he was in Najaf

   Italy says it has no intention of withdrawing its 3,000 troops from
   Iraq in the face of demands from kidnappers who have seized an Italian
   journalist.

   The government says it is committed to securing the release of the
   journalist, Enzo Baldoni, but the Italian presence in Iraq would
   continue.

   Earlier, the Arabic television channel, al-Jazeera, broadcast a video
   appearing to show Mr Baldoni.

   His kidnappers demanded that Italy pull its forces out of Iraq within
   48 hours.

   'Maintain commitments'

   "We are committed to obtaining the freedom of Mr Baldoni," Prime
   Minister Silvio Berlusconi's office said in a statement.

   "We will do so while maintaining the commitments made to the Iraqi
   provisional government," the government said.

   A group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq says it is holding the
   journalist.

   MISSING JOURNALISTS

   Enzo Baldoni (Italian, Diario magazine) - driver found dead near Najaf
   George Malbrunot (French, Le Figaro)
   Christian Chesnot (French, Radio France Internationale)
   All three missing since 19 August

   Black year for journalists

   In a statement to the Qatar-based television station, the group said
   that it "could not guarantee the Italian's safety... if Italy does not
   respond within 48 hours with a decision to withdraw its troops from
   Iraqi territories", Reuters news agency reported.

   In the video, broadcast on Tuesday, a man identifying himself as Enzo
   Baldoni says he is a journalist and Red Cross volunteer who came to
   Iraq to write about the resistance.

   Mr Baldoni has been missing since Thursday.

   His driver-interpreter was apparently found dead on Saturday and
   Italian newspapers have said the two were probably caught in an ambush
   between Baghdad and Najaf.

   The whereabouts of another two French journalists remains a mystery.

   Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot have not been heard of since
   Friday.

   US journalist Micah Garen was freed on Sunday by an Iraqi group who had
   held him hostage in the southern city of Nasiriya.

   China on the march
   By Phil Gordos
   BBC Sport in Athens

   Beijing will host the 2008 Olympic Games

   Joy in Chinese press at Olympics success

   China celebrated their best-ever Olympic medal haul in Athens,
   finishing the Games in second place behind the might of the United
   States.

   But with home backing in Beijing, there is every chance the People's
   Republic will be top of the pile in 2008.

   China are fast becoming the nation everyone has to fear.

   Traditionally strong in events like badminton, diving, shooting and
   table tennis, they are now getting golds elsewhere.

   In Greece, 110m hurdler Xiang Liu became the first Chinese male to win
   a track gold while tennis players Ting Li and Tian Tian Sun stormed to
   a shock win in the women's doubles.

   There were also golds for Xujuan Luo in the women's 100m breaststroke
   and canoeists Guanliang Meng and Wenjun Yang in the men's C2 500m.

   But if the Chinese are proving pretty speedy on the track and in the
   pool, take a look at the rate at which they are preparing for 2008.

   CHINA'S MEDAL HAULS

   1984: 15g, 8s, 9b
   1988: 5g, 11s, 12b
   1992: 16g, 22s, 16b
   1996: 16g, 22s, 12b
   2000: 28g, 16s, 15b
   2004: 32g, 17s, 14b

   They are so far ahead of schedule that International Olympic Committee
   president Jacques Rogge took the unprecedented step of urging
   organisers to slow down construction work in Beijing.

   His fear was that it would prove too costly to maintain the stadiums if
   they were completed 20 months in advance of the Games.

   Rogge was also worried that the venues would stand idle for long
   periods.

   But at least Beijing is unlikely to be dogged by the same problems that
   beset Athens, when there were genuine concerns the Greek capital would
   not be ready to host the 28th Olympiad.

   The major problem the Chinese government will have to face over the
   next four years is the endless questioning and examination of their
   human rights record.

   But Chen Ping, a member of Beijing's media and communications
   department, insists the country is prepared for the intense media
   spotlight.

   "I think we are ready and we want international journalists to come to
   Beijing to see what life is like," he told the BBC Sport website.

   "We want them to speak to people so they can see for themselves how
   excited everyone is."

   Beijing was selected as the host city for the Games on 13 July, 2001.

   Since then, the Beijing Organising Committee - or Bocog for short - has
   been working overtime.

   New roads and subways have and are being built, while a third terminal
   is currently under construction at the Beijing Capital International
   Airport.

   Special 'villages' will also be erected for the athletes and media, and
   organisers have already ensured there will be enough hotel rooms for
   the thousands of visitors.

   As for the venues, a total of 35 will be used, of which 30 will be
   situated in the city.

   BEIJING FACTFILE

   Population 14.56m - life expectancy 79.62 years
   Officials hope 1m people in Beijing will be able to speak English by
   2008
   Phrasebooks containing 100 questions in Chinese will be produced for
   foreign visitors
   Heritage sites include the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Great
   Wall, Summer Palace and Ming Tombs

   The sailing competition will take place in the port of Qingdao while
   Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang and Qinghuangdao will host the football
   preliminaries.

   Of the 30 venues in Beijing, 15 will be new, 11 already exist while the
   remaining four will be temporary.

   And there should be enough people to fill them, unlike in Athens, where
   several sports failed to attract capacity crowds.

   Most Athenians left when the Olympic circus rolled into town, but Ping
   is confident the same thing will not happen in 2008.

   The Games take place between August 8 and 24 and Ping said: "The people
   of Beijing are very enthusiastic. They know life will be harder because
   of all the guests but they will not be leaving."

   Bocog hopes everything will be ready by the end of 2007, giving them
   enough time to host test events at most of the venues and iron out any
   infrastructure problems.

   After the Athens debacle, that will be music to the ears of the IOC.

   Britons attack US cloning ban bid

   Cloned human embryos
   Stem cells could provide treatment for diseases such as Alzheimer's

   Top British scientists are backing an international campaign to stop
   the United States obtaining a worldwide ban on all types of human
   cloning.

   The Royal Society is among 68 academies urging the UN to ban
   reproductive but not therapeutic use of the technology.

   President George Bush's administration wants a complete ban, which the
   UN could introduce as early as October.

   Member states would not be compelled to sign up but scientists fear
   such a treaty could stifle stem cell research.

   'Will not sign'

   Professor Richard Gardner, chairman of the Royal Society's working
   group on stem cell research and cloning, said: "It is clear that if the
   UN bans all forms of human cloning, the UK, and other countries which
   currently permit carefully regulated therapeutic cloning, will not sign
   up to it."

   Scientists who oppose a complete ban believe it could backfire by
   halting efforts to stop maverick cloning scientists.

   Prof Gardner continued: "To effectively stop cowboy cloners claiming
   that their work on human reproductive cloning is acceptable, because it
   is not outlawed throughout the world, a UN convention must be passed
   that all countries are willing to endorse."

   To stop cowboy cloners claiming their work on human reproductive
   cloning is acceptable... a UN convention must be passed that all
   countries are willing to endorse

   Professor Richard Gardner

   He said a clear distinction by the UN between reproductive and
   therapeutic cloning would "provide invaluable guidance in passing
   effective legislation".

   He added that it should be noted the US had not yet banned reproductive
   cloning because of its attempts to include therapeutic cloning in the
   ban.

   Last year, the UN, which could introduce a ban at its 59th General
   Session in October, voted by a slim margin to postpone the decision,
   despite powerful lobbying by the US.

   Earlier this month, scientists from the University of Newcastle were
   granted a licence to clone human embryos in the UK for medical
   research.

   Stem cells from early embryos could potentially be used to provide new
   treatments for incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and
   Parkinson's.

   Public 'want smoking age raised'

   Woman smoking in a pub
   Two thirds backed a smoking ban in pubs

   Four out of five people want the legal smoking age to be raised from 16
   to 18 to deter young people from taking up the habit, a BBC poll
   suggests.

   ICM conducted the nationwide phone poll of 1,010 adults in England,
   Wales and Scotland between 20 and 22 August.

   The majority of people believed raising the age at which teenagers
   could buy cigarettes would deter them from taking up the habit.

   A slight majority thought the age limit should be raised to 21.

   White Paper

   The BBC's Healthy Britain poll questioned people about a range of
   public health issues. Further data will be revealed later this week.

   HEALTH POLL: SMOKING

   Key findings from the BBC's poll on attitudes to public health

   In graphics

   The survey found the public also backed tough measures to reduce the
   numbers of children who smoke.

   Of those questioned, 93% supported increasing and enforcing the
   penalties for selling tobacco to children, and two thirds said parents
   who consistently allow their under-age children to smoke should
   ultimately face prosecution.

   Just over half also thought smoking should be made more expensive, and
   three-quarters said there should be more spent on anti-smoking
   publicity campaigns.

   The government is currently considering whether smoking should be
   restricted in the workplace, including pubs and clubs.

   Its decision will be revealed in a Public Health White Paper, due to be
   published this autumn.

   Raising the age isn't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the
   shop

   Daniel Jones, a 16-year-old smoker

   Why do young people keep smoking?

   In the BBC survey, two thirds of those questioned were in favour of
   such a ban.

   But while 69% thought government should be trying to change people's
   behaviour on smoking - including half of the smokers questioned - 64%
   think that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them.

   Melanie Johnson, the public health minister, told the BBC progress had
   already been made in cutting smoking among young teenagers.

   However, she said public feedback to the government's consultation on
   public health had not indicated that raising the legal smoking age was
   a particular priority.

   Dr Vivienne Nathanson, of the British Medical Association, said: "The
   best way to prevent young people from smoking is to ban smoking in
   enclosed public places, increase taxation on cigarettes and enforce
   exisiting age limit legislation.

   "What we need to concentrate on is where one person's "enjoyment" harms
   others and this means the government showing leadership and following
   the examples of Ireland and Norway."

   'Still desirable'

   A spokesman for the group Action on Smoking and Health said: "We are
   strongly against young people smoking or buying cigarettes for others.

   The suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21 shows how hysterical
   the smoking debate has become

   Simon Clark, Forest

   But he said simply raising the legal age for buying cigarettes may not
   have much effect.

   "Teenagers are notoriously sharp at getting round such restrictions and
   they would be hard to enforce.

   "More important may be to stop smoking being seen as a desirable and
   adult thing to do - stop adults smoking and teenagers are much less
   likely to start. That's one reason why we see ending smoking at work as
   a top priority."

   Daniel Jones, 16, started smoking when he was 12. He now smokes 20
   cigarettes a day. He did not think raising the age restriction would
   make any difference.

   "Raising the age isn't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the
   shop," he said.

   Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights group Forest, said, while it
   supported "reasonable measures that made it more difficult for people
   under 18 to buy tobacco.

   He added: "However, the suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21
   shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become.

   "The law needs to be consistent. At present you can have sex at 16,
   drive a car at 17, and drink alcohol in a pub at 18. Some people would
   even like to lower the voting age from 18 to 16.

   "There needs to be a clear point at which children are legally declared
   to be adults and are therefore considered mature enough to make their
   own decisions about their health and lifestyle."

   Bacall slates Kidman 'legend' tag

   Nicole Kidman, Jonathan Glazer and Lauren Bacall
   Bacall (right) began her acting career in 1944

   Veteran actress Lauren Bacall has labelled co-star Nicole Kidman a
   "beginner" after an ITV presenter described Kidman as a "legend".

   "She's not a legend. She's a beginner... she can't be a legend at
   whatever age she is," Bacall told GMTV.

   Kidman, 37, and Bacall, 79, are at the Venice Film Festival to promote
   their film Birth. Bacall plays Kidman's mum.

   Bacall told a recent press conference she and Kidman had a "fabulous
   relationship both on screen and off".

   "I love working with a young actress," said Bacall.

   The pair also appeared together in Lars von Trier's Dogville last year.

   Tight security

   Security has been stepped up following the arrival of Kidman in Venice,
   after a series of gaffes at Al Pacino's premiere on Tuesday.

   Pacino ended up with no seat at The Merchant of Venice, with a computer
   glitch being blamed for producing 200 too many tickets for the event.

   Nicole Kidman
   Kidman arrived in Venice on Monday

   The screening was also delayed after several hoax bomb threats.

   More time will be given before Kidman's premiere of Birth, so that
   seats can be checked for explosive devices.

   The controversial film, which features Kidman in the bath with a
   10-year-old boy who her character believes is a reincarnation of her
   dead husband, was booed by journalists at a preview screening on
   Wednesday.

   Kidman also kisses the boy in the movie.

   "It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy,
   I wanted to make a film where you understand love," said Kidman.

   Director Jonathan Glazer said: "You can't aim to please everyone. I
   would hope I only make films that some people like and some people
   don't."

   Kidman arrived in Venice on Monday, three days after her former husband
   Tom Cruise left, having promoted his movie Collateral.

   Meticulous security checks caused by the influx of big name stars at
   the festival has been blamed for problems at festival.

   Al Pacino
   Al Pacino was said to be happy with the large turnout for the screening

   "The world is a dangerous place right now and with so many Hollywood
   stars here this year, security is more of a priority than ever," a
   festival spokeswoman said.

   Good humoured

   "Of course, we know the threats are probably a hoax but we have a duty
   to check each one," she added.

   Producers of Pacino's film insisted the actor was happy with the event
   and would be back in Venice "very soon".

   Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein found his film, Finding Neverland, pushed
   back to a 2am screening because of the knock-on effects of the delays.

   He joked he would drown the festival director in the lagoon "with his
   feet encased in cement".

   Kate Winslet, who stars in the film about the life of Peter Pan author
   JM Barrie, said: "You have to be game for anything in this business."

   Analysis: Madrid terror probe
   By Elinor Shields
   BBC News Online

   A wrecked train carriage from the 11 March Madrid blasts
   Police have pieced together clues from the unexploded bombs

   Six months after the Madrid train blasts, Spanish investigators believe
   they have clarified key aspects of the plot that caused the deaths of
   191 people.

   A total of 68 people have been arrested and 20 suspects are being held,
   Spanish police sources told BBC News Online.

   After the former government's initial insistence that the militant
   Basque separatists Eta were behind the attack, an Islamic group with
   links to al-Qaeda is now blamed.

   The core cell has been dismantled. The suspected intellectual
   mastermind, Rabei Osman Ahmed, is awaiting extradition from Italy.
   Serhane ben Abdelmajid Farkhet, a suspected co-ordinator, is dead.
   Another is in custody.

   But while aspects of the plot may be clear, the investigation is not
   closed.

   The March attacks made Spain realise it was a frontline state and that
   they need to react to that

   Michael Clarke, terrorism expert

   The judge in charge of the inquiry, Juan del Olmo, has warned there are
   still terror cells in Spain, which could strike again.

   "(The March attacks) made Spain realise it was a frontline state and
   that they need to react to that," said Professor Michael Clarke, a
   terrorism expert at King's College, London.

   Any counter-terrorism strategy must be characterised by the "3 Ps", he
   said: protection, penetration and a political process, or dialogue,
   with groups to whom the "terrorists" appeal.

   Wake-up call

   Analysts argue that the March blasts did not herald the arrival of a
   new threat so much as a successful attack.

   The judge investigating al-Qaeda activity in Spain says the group had
   put down roots in the country in the mid-1990s, according to Mia Soar,
   Europe editor for Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments.

   But observers suggest that Spanish authorities and society were taken
   by surprise because of their preoccupation with Eta.

   Juan del Olmo
   Juan del Olmo says the attacks were prepared in a few months

   For Professor Clarke, this left Spanish authorities "flat-footed" to a
   different kind of terror threat - which he characterises as small,
   amateur and largely ineffective groups inspired and in this case aided
   by al-Qaeda.

   It seems that the group behind the Madrid attacks was motivated, in
   part, by local and historical grievances against the Spanish.

   But they sought the shock-value of large-scale killings through
   co-ordinated attacks akin to an al-Qaeda strike.

   Vulnerable

   In the aftermath of the attacks, the Spanish authorities have sought to
   improve their capacity to protect, penetrate and develop a political
   process to combat Islamic militants.

   Proposed moves are said to include 20 counter-terrorist agents in Ceuta
   and Melilla, the Spanish enclaves in Morocco that the attacks have
   shown to be the gateway for Islamic militants to enter Spain.

   Train wreckage from one of the 11 March blasts in Madrid

   A new anti-terrorism centre that co-ordinates the work of police and
   intelligence agencies is due to start in the next few months.

   And observers say the new government is trying to build bridges with
   immigrant communities in Spain and beyond. Foreign Minister Miguel
   Angel Moratinos has recently announced that Spain plans to build better
   relations with Muslim countries as a part of its new anti-terrorist
   strategy.

   One step is the proposed judge exchange project with Morocco - a judge
   from Madrid will be based in Rabat and vice versa to facilitate the
   exchange of information on the fight against terror and illegal
   immigration.

   But analysts point out that Spain - along with many other countries -
   remains fundamentally vulnerable.

   The evidence to date suggests that the Madrid attacks did not take long
   to plan or cost much to commit.

   The perpetrators would rather die rather than surrender, as Ms Soar
   points out. In April seven suspects blew themselves up in a suburban
   Madrid apartment as police surrounded the building.

   Spanish awareness may have changed, but the situation is very difficult
   to fight, said Casimiro Garcia, a director at Spanish newspaper El
   Mundo.

   "It will take a long time," he said.

   Wet weather hits Coca-Cola sales

   Coca-Cola can
   Wet and cold weather in Europe has hit consumers' thirst for Coke

   Coca-Cola, the world's largest maker of soft drinks, has issued a
   profit warning blaming "challenging operating conditions in key
   markets".

   The company explained that one of the main drags on earnings has been
   cold and wet weather in northern Europe

   Sales also have suffered in the US, where Coca-Cola said it has been
   slow to react to changes in the market.

   The profits warning sent shares in the Atlanta firm tumbling to a 16
   month low, closing down 4% at $41.16.

   The maker of Pepsi said that the number of cases sold worldwide rose by
   2% in the third quarter. Coca-Cola expects volumes to increase by as
   much as 1% over the same period.

   Earnings slide

   Many increasingly health-conscious consumers are being lured by rival
   products such as mineral water and fruit juices.

   As a result, Coca-Cola said that earnings per share (EPS) in the second
   half of 2004 will be between 77 and 82 cents a share. The estimate
   includes a one-off charge of as much as $450m (369m euros; £253m)
   relating to a change in the laws governing the deposits left on bottles
   in Germany.

   Without that exceptional charge, earnings per share is likely to be 88
   and 92 cents, Coca-Cola said. Analysts had been expecting profit of
   close to 99 cents.

   Coke cans
   Is Coca-Cola losing its appeal?

   The news was not well received on Wall Street, and Coca-Cola shares
   were down 4.5% at $40.94 in morning trade.

   Chief executive and chairman Neville Isdell, who came out of retirement
   to help turn the company's fortunes around, said he was unhappy with
   the figures but expected an improvement.

   "Although it is not our practice to provide specific earnings guidance,
   we have made an exception today in the interest of clear and timely
   communication," Mr Isdell said in a statement.

   "We want to inform investors of business trends that are significantly
   impacting our operating environment."

   'Clear' bacteria link to Crohn's

   bowel scan
   Crohn's disease affects 100,000 people in Britain

   The clearest evidence yet that Crohn's disease is caused by a type of
   bacteria blamed for a similar animal disorder has been published by US
   researchers.

   Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) was found for the
   first time in the blood of people with the disorder.

   Half of the 28 people with Crohn's tested positive for Map.

   Dr Saleh Naser, from the University of Central Florida, who led the
   research, said a large-scale study was needed.

   Crohn's disease affects 100,000 Britons and can cause a variety of
   symptoms from a lack of appetite to chronic diarrhoea and abdominal
   pain.

   The cause of the disease is not yet known but the Map bacterium, which
   causes Johne's disease, a similar intestinal disorder, in cattle, sheep
   and goats, was first linked to Crohn's 20 years ago.

   Dr Naser's team took blood samples from 52 people - 28 with Crohn's,
   nine with ulcerative colitis, another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
   and 15 people without a IBD.

   Blood

   The live bacterium was found in the blood of 14 patients with Crohn's
   but in none of the people without the disorder.

   It is the first time the bacterium has been found in the blood as other
   studies have focused on human tissue.

   Two people with ulcerative colitis were also reported to have Map
   present but the study said this could have been because they had
   Crohn's.

   Traces of Map DNA were found in some of the people with ulcerative
   colitis and three without an IBD.

   The study suggested this was because Map is common in the environment
   with exposure most likely to happen through the food and water supply.

   The findings now need to be replicated in other laboratories. Whatever
   one's view, Map cannot continue to be ignored in Crohn's disease

   Professor Warwick Selby, of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in
   Australia

   However, it is thought these people would not have developed Crohn's as
   people with the disorder have to be genetically susceptible first.

   In the past, scientists have claimed Crohn's is passed to humans
   through milk.

   Dr Naser said: "The fact that some people had Map DNA in their blood is
   worrying. It suggests the bacterium is not just opportunistic.

   "It is present more than we think. We know cattle and sheep have this
   bacteria so it is possible animals may be spreading the disease and
   pasteurisation is not doing the job it should be."

   'Significant'

   He said the fact that half the people with Crohn's had Map was a
   "significant number" and future studies should result in a higher
   proportion.

   "We only took a small blood sample, if we are right, Map will be
   present in a greater proportion of people with Crohn's.

   "What we now need is more work to prove this theory."

   Writing in the Lancet, Professor Warwick Selby, of the Gastroenterology
   and Liver Centre at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia,
   agreed more research was needed.

   "This report may still fall short of proving that Map is one of the
   causes of Crohn's disease but as with similar studies it raises many
   important questions.

   "The findings now need to be replicated in other laboratories. Whatever
   one's view, Map cannot continue to be ignored in Crohn's disease."

   Dr Martin Sarner, the honorary secretary of Core, formerly the
   Digestive Disorders Foundation, said if it could be proved Map caused
   Crohn's it would represent a huge breakthrough for patients.

   "It would help in the treatment of the disease. It is terribly
   debilitating for people.

   "At the moment people are with given medication, which just keeps the
   inflammation at bay or they have surgery which can involve cutting away
   tissue.

   "And the problem they face is that it can just keep coming back."

   Campaign column: Shifting focus - again
   By Tom Carver
   BBC correspondent in Washington

   John Kerry has flipped again.

   John Kerry giving a speech on Iraq
   Kerry and his team have shifted focus on to Iraq

   A month ago, his campaign was saying it was going to focus on domestic
   issues. The federal deficit. Unemployment. Outsourcing. They promised a
   vision for the future with lots of new initiatives.

   But in the past 10 days, John Kerry has concentrated on Iraq instead.

   It may be because events in Iraq seem to be getting worse every day, so
   to ignore it looked more and more foolish. The Kerry team often
   complains that his comments on Iraq are the only parts of his speeches
   that ever make the evening news anyway.

   It also may have something to do with the reshuffle inside his
   campaign.

   Mr Kerry's main strategist, Bob Shrum, who was reluctant to attack
   President Bush too directly on national security, has been partially
   eclipsed by the arrival of John Sasso, Mr Kerry's new travelling
   campaign manager, and Joe Lockhart, Bill Clinton's former spokesman.

   Those who doubted whether Iraq or the world would be better off without
   Saddam Hussein, and those who believe we are not safer with his
   capture, don't have the judgment to be president or the credibility to
   be elected president

   John Kerry,
   speaking earlier this year

   However, a key reason for the change is probably to do with the
   upcoming debates.

   The first debate on 30 September was originally supposed to be on
   domestic issues. But during negotiations between the two sides, the
   Bush team succeeded in getting this switched to foreign policy.

   The first debate traditionally gets the most attention and the White
   House believes that the war on terrorism is its strongest suit.

   If Mr Bush is deemed the winner in that debate, it will be very hard
   for Mr Kerry to stop him.

   So the Kerry team is now focusing all its attention on Iraq to try to
   weaken the opponent as much as possible beforehand.

   Kerry's Vietnam service is now a millstone around his neck

   Vietnam: What voters say

   The problem for Mr Kerry is that his own position on Iraq is
   problematic. Every time he launches an attack, the White House responds
   by reminding people that John Kerry voted for the war.

   "Those who doubted whether Iraq or the world would be better off
   without Saddam Hussein, and those who believe we are not safer with his
   capture, don't have the judgment to be president or the credibility to
   be elected president."

   John Kerry said those words during the primaries when he was defending
   himself against attacks by the anti-war candidate Howard Dean.

   Recently, George W Bush has been quoting this in his speeches, adding
   with a mischievous smile: "I couldn't agree more."

   Spotlight on Kerry

   Like all elections with an incumbent, this one should be a referendum
   on George W Bush. But the Bush campaign team is successfully turning it
   into a referendum on John Kerry.

   Despite the violence in Iraq, the execution of American hostages, the
   soaring financial burden of reconstruction, the fractured relations
   with the UN, the Bush campaign has managed to keep the spotlight firmly
   on Mr Kerry, not Mr Bush. They've done it using Vietnam.

   George W Bush at the UN
   Bush is now ahead of Kerry in the polls

   Vietnam, which John Kerry used to see as his greatest asset, is turning
   into a millstone round his neck.

   The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which launched a vicious series of
   TV advertisements casting doubt on his war record, is now accusing Mr
   Kerry of consorting with "enemy leaders".

   An advertisement airing this week claims that Mr Kerry met members of
   the North Vietnamese government in Paris during the final stages of the
   Vietnam War.

   Mr Kerry has never hidden this. During Senate testimony at the time, he
   talked about the meetings, saying it was a fact-finding trip.

   But few voters bother to investigate this kind of thing for themselves,
   so the association of meeting enemy leaders in a war and Paris, the
   capital of America's fiercest European critic, is likely to stick.

   As a result of this media coverage, 60% of voters now think Mr Kerry
   was "hiding something" about Vietnam, according to a recent New York
   Times/CBS poll. Some 60% no longer have confidence in his ability to
   deal with an international crisis.

   To be sure, George W Bush also has negative ratings. The same poll
   shows that 80% think he was "hiding something" about the war in Iraq.

   Yet Mr Bush is eight points ahead of Kerry. That suggests that people's
   reservations about John Kerry are now greater than their reservations
   about Mr Bush.

   Coma woman intervention 'illegal'

   File photo of Terri Schiavo
   Doctors say Terri is in a persistent vegetative state

   Florida Governor Jeb Bush acted illegally by intervening to keep a
   brain-damaged woman alive against her husband's wishes, a court has
   ruled.

   The decision by the Florida Supreme Court means Terri Schiavo's fate is
   again uncertain, 14 years after she fell unconscious after a heart
   attack.

   Mrs Schiavo's parents have battled to keep her alive, and gained the
   support of Mr Bush. He may yet go to appeal.

   He brought in a law last year allowing him to insist she be kept alive.

   After "Terri's Law" was passed, her feeding tube was reinserted, six
   days after it had been removed with a judge's approval.

   Medicine cannot cure this condition. Unless an act of God, a true
   miracle, were to recreate her brain, Theresa will always remain in an
   unconscious, reflexive state

   Florida Supreme Court ruling

   But the Supreme Court on Thursday declared the law "unconstitutional as
   a violation of separation of powers, as a violation of the right of
   privacy and as unconstitutional retroactive legislation".

   Mrs Schiavo's husband Michael has argued for years that he wants her to
   be allowed to die humanely.

   Florida's state constitution protects the right of terminally ill
   patients to die "with dignity."

   Guardian status

   The woman's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, have long fought to
   keep her alive, saying she has given signs of consciousness, and could
   recover over time.

   But the court said on Thursday: "Medicine cannot cure this condition.
   Unless an act of God, a true miracle, were to recreate her brain,
   Theresa will always remain in an unconscious, reflexive state."

   A spokeswoman for Mr Bush, the brother of President George Bush, said
   lawyers were considering whether to ask the Florida Supreme Court to
   rehear the case, or appeal to the US Supreme Court.

   Even if that does not happen, Mr Schiavo may not be able to allow his
   wife to die immediately.

   Lawyers for her parents are trying in another case to have his status
   as her legal guardian removed.

   Dubai airport accident kills five

   Construction workers run out of the Dubai Airport new terminal's
   construction site Construction workers ran from the scene of the
   accident

   Five building labourers have been killed and 12 injured in an accident
   at a construction site at Dubai airport.

   A reinforcement cage that was holding up a new wall that was being
   built collapsed, bringing down the wall and trapping workers under it.

   The accident happened during the building of a new third terminal,
   civil aviation authorities said.

   The airport - one of the world's busiest and fastest-growing - is being
   expanded at a cost of $4.1bn.

   "The wall fell down, and we all ran to help, but there wasn't anything
   we could do,"one worker, Daljinder Singh, told the Associated Press
   news agency.

   The injured workers were taken to two hospitals.

   But there has been no disruption to flights.

   New terminal

   The accident happened at 1100 (0700 GMT) according to building workers
   quoted by AP. They said about 150 workers were at the site at the time.

   Most construction workers in the UAE come from South Asia, although the
   airport authorities have not confirmed the nationalities of those
   involved in the accident.

   The new terminal, to be used by Emirates airline, is due to open for
   passengers in 2006.

   It has been designed by France's Aeroports de Paris (ADP) and will be
   in the shape of a giant plane wing almost 1km long (1,100yds).

   An ADP official in Dubai said the firm was not involved in the
   construction of the terminal.

   The French company also operates Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris,
   where a roof at a new terminal collapsed in May, killing four people.

   Sharon plan 'blocked peace talks'

   Israeli settlement activists
   Widespread opposition remains to the Gaza settlement evacuation

   A top Israeli official has claimed that Ariel Sharon's Gaza withdrawal
   plan was deliberately formulated to block peace negotiations with
   Yasser Arafat.

   "The significance of the plan is the freezing of the peace process,"
   Dov Weisglass told Haaretz newspaper, adding the US had given its
   backing.

   Palestinian statehood, refugees and the status of Jerusalem had
   effectively been dropped off the agenda, he said.

   But he later added Israel was open to talks with other Palestinian
   leaders.

   Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all
   that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda

   Dov Weisglass

   Correspondents say the comments are the most far-reaching yet on Prime
   Minister Sharon's policies towards the Palestinians.

   The statement may be designed to court Israeli hardliners who have not
   backed the Gaza plan, they suggest.

   Mr Sharon voiced renewed support for the US-backed peace plan known as
   the roadmap after Haaretz published Mr Weisglass' comments.

   It was "the only plan liable to help progress towards a viable
   political agreement", a brief statement from his office said, adding
   that the Palestinian violence should be blamed for any freeze.

   'Formaldehyde'

   Mr Weisglass was one of the Gaza plan's architects as the prime
   minister's former chief of staff and he is now his point man in the US.

   Speaking after the controversial interview was published, he said there
   had been no intention to freeze the "political process as such".

   "But there was definitely an intention not to hold a political process
   with the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] in its present state," he
   told Israeli radio.

   In his interview for Haaretz, he described disengagement from Gaza as
   "formaldehyde".

   "It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will
   not be a political process with the Palestinians," he said.

   Israel is planning to pull all its settlers out of Gaza and the troops
   that protect them as part of its plan but it will maintain control of
   Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace. Four West Bank settlements are
   also to be evacuated.

   Mr Weisglass boasted that he had in effect secured US approval "that
   part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all".

   "The rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into
   Finns," he joked.

   Initiative

   In the Haaretz interview, Mr Weisglass makes it clear that the
   disengagement plan derived from a sense of impending crisis about 12
   months ago.

   Some settlements will be dealt with "when Palestinians become Finns"

   With Israel's economy stagnant and the rival Geneva Initiative being
   touted by Mr Sharon's political opponents, Mr Weisglass said the
   refusal by some servicemen and women to fight in the occupied
   territories was seen as the last straw.

   "These were not weird kids with green ponytails and a ring in their
   nose with a strong odour of grass. These were... really our finest
   young people," he said.

   So the Sharon government felt the need to clasp the initiative.

   "Although by the way the Americans read the situation, the blame fell
   on the Palestinians not on us, [Mr Sharon] grasped that this state of
   affairs could not last, that [the Palestinians] wouldn't leave us
   alone, wouldn't get off our case."

   Removed indefinitely

   The present state of affairs, Mr Weisglass suggests, is much more
   satisfactory for Mr Sharon and government:

   Can Israel expect to stop diplomatic processes around the world? We
   should not delude ourselves

   Labour leader Shimon Peres

   "When you freeze [the peace] process, you prevent the establishment of
   a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the [Palestinian]
   refugees, the borders and Jerusalem.

   "Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all
   that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda.

   "And all this with authority and permission. All with a [US]
   presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress."

   There has been no comment on the interview from the US embassy in Tel
   Aviv. Washington is a sponsor of the roadmap plan which foresees the
   creation of a Palestinian state that can live in peace next to Israel.

   Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres has responded by saying that the
   "stalling games" outlined by Mr Weisglass are sure to backfire.

   "Can Israel expect to stop diplomatic processes around the world? We
   should not delude ourselves. Until we have peace we [cannot expect]
   calm and security," he said.

   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat described it as "very
   obvious" that Mr Sharon's policies were designed to undermine a
   negotiated Middle East peace settlement.

   Woods blamed for own woes

   Vijay Singh (left) with Tiger Woods
   Singh (left) has eclipsed Woods throughout the season

   World number one Vijay Singh believes Tiger Woods has fallen down the
   rankings because of his failure to change his golf swing.

   Singh replaced Woods as the world's best after winning the Deutsche
   Bank Championship in September and Woods has since dropped to third.

   "As you get older you have to keep adjusting to your golf swing, your
   body does not stay the same," said Singh.

   "I have adjusted for the better and I don't think he has done that."

   Academy: Tiger's swing woes

   Prior to his fall down the rankings behind Singh and Ernie Els, Woods
   had held the world number one spot for five years.

   The American dominated world golf during that time, winning the
   majority of the biggest tournaments.

   Singh said the 28-year-old's problems had been caused by his body
   altering as he has matured.

   "I think it's his body change," said Singh.

   "When he first came on the scene he was extremely strong. I'm not
   saying he's not strong now but you do slow down a little bit. The golf
   swing has to match your body ability.

   "His body and his golf swing do not match like it did some five years
   or four years ago so he has to adjust that. I'm sure once he figures
   that one out he'll be okay."

   US teams 'tried to free hostages'

   Militants stand behind Eugene Armstrong Mr Armstrong's killing
   reportedly spurred rescue teams to try again

   American rescue teams tried at least twice to free two US citizens and
   a Briton taken hostage in Iraq and later killed, sources say in
   Washington.

   Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley were killed soon after their
   abduction on 16 September while British man Kenneth Bigley was beheaded
   last week.

   Rescuers acting on intelligence reports reportedly went to two sites in
   Baghdad but on both occasions found nothing.

   "They just got there and nobody was there," the unnamed sources said.

   All three men, who had been working as engineers in Iraq, were killed
   on camera by an Islamist group believed to be led by Jordanian-born
   militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

   Mr Bigley, 62, was allowed by his captors to issue desperate appeals
   for his release on video before he was finally beheaded, three weeks
   after his capture.

   Iraqi reports say he tried to flee from his captors shortly before his
   death.

   Two attempts

   According to a US source, rescue attempts were carried out early on in
   the hostage drama - the first when all three of the hostages were
   thought to be still alive and the second after the first American, Mr
   Armstrong, had been killed.

   "We don't really know whether the men were ever at the spots," one
   official told Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity.

   "But there were attempts to get them."

   US defence officials insisted at the time that considerable efforts
   were being made to try to get the hostages released.

   On Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that an
   intermediary had passed messages to the militants holding Mr Bigley,
   urging them not to kill their captive.

   "But at no stage did they abandon their demands relating to the release
   of women prisoners, even though they were well aware that there are no
   women prisoners in British custody in Iraq."

   He added that there would be "a full internal review of what we have
   done, a look at whether there were other things could have done which
   might have made a difference".

   "I genuinely don't think there are, however," he said.

   Mr Bigley's family, meanwhile, thanked the public for its support.

   Mr Bigley's 65-year-old brother, Stan, said the display of solidarity
   had made the family's three-week ordeal "a little more bearable".

Analysts Yawn at Intel's Slightly Speedier Centrino

   Analysts Yawn at Intel's Slightly Speedier Centrino

   The 765 will cost $637 for 1,000, while the price for the marginally
   slower 755 dropped to $423. Mercury Research president Dean McCarron
   said that the changes don't impact the market, but "what does change is
   that you get a higher performance processor at any given price."

   Just days after dropping prices on its line of Centrino mobile
   processors for notebook PCs, Intel has added an incrementally speedier
   chip: the Pentium M 765. Analysts said the new chip is no big deal.

   Jim McGregor, principal analyst at In-Stat/MDR, told TechNewsWorld that
   the slightly higher speed chip will have no impact on the market.

   "This is simply a process called a 'binning,'" he explained. "Products
   are binned according to speeds they pass testing at. Typically as a
   product matures, especially on a new process, yields at higher speeds
   increase. The company will introduce the higher speed when they know
   they can yield enough to meet projected demand. This also allows them
   to charge a premium for the new speed grade. Likewise, they drop slower
   speed grades as the parts yield at the higher speeds. This is exactly
   what Intel is doing."

Intel's Specs

   The 765 offers 2 MB of Level 2 cache and what Intel calls a
   "power-optimized" 400 MHz system bus. The company said the chip runs at
   a clock speed of 2.1 GHz. That power optimization gives it a slight
   edge in speed over the 755, which runs at 2 GHz.

   The 765 will cost US$637 for 1,000. The new price for the 755 is $423
   for 1,000.

   Intel announced the price drops Oct. 17. At that time Mercury Research
   president Dean McCarron told TechNewsWorld that the company lowered
   prices to "make room for the new products at the higher price points."

   McCarron also said that the changes don't impact the market, but "what
   does change is that you get a higher performance processor at any given
   price." This is what has happened with today's announcement.

Available Worldwide Today

   The new chip will be used in notebooks that Intel introduced worldwide
   today. The chip includes power-saving technologies that help extend
   battery life, although the company did not say by how much.

   Intel is using its 90 nm fabrication technology to manufacture the 765.
   The company said that half its chips are now made using the technique.

   Indonesian leader sets out goals

   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is sworn in as Indonesian president
   Mr Yudhoyono is a former security minister

   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has promised an ambitious programme of
   reforms, soon after he was sworn in as Indonesia's first
   directly-elected president.

   Mr Yudhoyono undertook to "roll up his sleeves" and tackle problems
   such as corruption, nepotism and terrorism.

   The BBC Jakarta correspondent says the voters have given the president
   a huge mandate, and they expect him to use it.

   Mr Yudhoyono said one of his biggest challenges was corruption and he
   would lead a programme to fight it.

   Key to that challenge will be the new attorney general, announced on
   Wednesday as Abdul Rahman Saleh, a supreme court judge.

   Another key position, that of finance minister, will be filled by Jusuf
   Anwar, an economist at the Asian Development Bank.

   But there was disquiet at the choice of economics minister, Aburizal
   Bakrie, a businessman whose group ran up huge debts during the Asian
   financial crisis five years ago.

   Hassan Wirayuda remains as foreign minister in the new government.

   Other areas in which Mr Yudhoyono promised improvement included
   economic growth - he said more than 16% of Indonesians were below the
   poverty line - and provincial unrest.

   "My administration will give a special attention on the handling of
   conflicting situations in Aceh and Papua," he said.

   He also warned that the country faced the continuing threat of
   terrorism.

   Indonesia suffered three major terrorist attacks while his predecessor,
   Megawati Sukarnoputri, was in office, including the Bali nightclub
   bombings in October 2002.

   But the new president sounded a note of caution, warning that all these
   problems would not be solved immediately.

   "It is impossible to resolve all of those complicated problems within
   100 days... But I have a strong conviction that our determination and
   good will are far more superior than the problems we are facing. At
   this point, our character as a great nation is truly under a severe
   test," he said.

   There are huge expectations resting on his shoulders, and according to
   the Jakarta Post, at least 200 people held a demonstration on Wednesday
   demanding that Mr Yudhoyono tackle corruption in his first 100 days of
   office.

   Earlier, regional and foreign leaders witnessed him swear to serve the
   nation as a copy of the Koran was held above his head.

   Former President Megawati chose to stay away in what appears to be a
   deliberate snub towards the man who defeated her.

   She was due to make a farewell speech during the ceremony, but analysts
   say she has apparently not forgiven Mr Yudhoyono for quitting her
   cabinet earlier this year to run against her.

   Wearing a grey suit and traditional peci cap, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
   stood before the assembled ranks of politicians and foreign dignitaries
   to read the oath of office.

   "In the name of God, I will fulfil my duty as president to the best of
   my ability," Mr Yudhoyono said, as a religious leader held a copy of
   the Koran above his head.

   Mr Yudhoyono has spent the last month interviewing potential ministers
   and mulling over the challenges that face him in his new job.

   He is said to be considering setting up US-style national councils to
   provide him with expert advice - all part of what his aides say will be
   a more professional technocratic approach to government.

   Pill 'may cut heart disease risk'
   By Ania Lichtarowicz
   BBC News health correspondent

   Contraceptive pill
   Oestrogen in the Pill could offer protective benefits

   The oral contraceptive pill may protect women from heart disease and
   some cancers, scientists suggest.

   The research, presented to the American Society for Reproductive
   Medicine (ASRM) meeting in Philadelphia, involved more than 160,000
   women.

   It found the risk was lowest for women who had taken the Pill for over
   a year.

   The Wayne State University, Detroit, study contradicts previous
   research which suggested the Pill increased the risk of those
   conditions.

   However, the Detroit study - one of the largest ever done into the
   Pill's long term effects - shows the overall risk of developing heart
   disease was about 10% lower in women who've taken the pill for at least
   a year.

   It would be unwise to suggest that the pill should be taken on a
   regular basis to protect against CHD

   Cathy Ross, British Heart Foundation

   The research suggests that the Pill is particularly protective against
   heart attacks, angina and mini strokes and cuts the risk of ovary and
   womb cancers.

   Dr Rahi Victory, who led the research, said it could be the female
   hormone, found in many types of oral contraceptives, which is having a
   protective effect.

   He said: "It is likely that oestrogen reduces the inflammation in the
   blood vessels.

   "We know that it has an effect on a molecule called nitric oxide which
   has to do with healing of a blood vessel as well as having to do with
   stretching open the blood vessel - dilating the blood vessel as we like
   to call it.

   "So those are both beneficial molecular level events that occur in
   women that take oestrogen that would contribute to preventing improving
   the incidence of heart disease. "

   'Do not ignore risks'

   Oestrogen stops blockages from building up in the arteries, which slows
   down the blood flow. It is these blockages that lead to heart disease,

   Cathy Ross, a spokesperson for the British Heart Foundation, said:
   "Whilst we welcome all research that examines reduction of risk factors
   associated with CHD, the potentially serious risks associated with
   taking the contraceptive pill, such a blood clots, should not be
   ignored.

   "It would be unwise to suggest that the pill should be taken on a
   regular basis to protect against CHD."

   However, the protective effect of the Pill against some cancers cannot
   be explained.

   Dr Amy Berrington, of Cancer Research UK, said the link between oral
   contraceptive use and cancer risk was highly complex, with studies
   showing that taking the Pill reduced ovarian and endometrial cancer
   risk, but increased the risk of breast cancer risk and probably also
   cervical cancer.

   She added: "However, once a woman has stopped using the Pill, her risk
   of breast cancer falls again until, after about 10 years, her risk is
   the same as if she had not taken the Pill.

   "An important outstanding question is how long the reductions in
   ovarian and endometrial cancer risks remain after women stopping taking
   the Pill."

   'Natural trigger'

   A second study at the conference found coming off the Pill appeared to
   increase a woman's sex drive.

   Researchers at the University of California studied 20 women, aged
   around 34, who stopped taking the Pill after six months.

   When a healthy pre-menopausal woman experiences decreased sexual
   function, hormonal contraception could be considered a possible cause

   Dr Marian Dashwood, ASRM

   Their libido increased, and they experienced less sexual dysfunction
   such as vaginal dryness.

   The researchers suggest one in six women who are taking the Pill
   experience such problems.

   They say not taking the Pill is linked to a rise in levels of the sex
   hormone testosterone and a fall in a hormone that can suppress desire.

   It is also suggested that the loss of sexual desire could be linked to
   the elimination of ovulation, removing a natural trigger for a woman to
   have sex.

   Dr Marian Damewood, president of the ASRM, said: "When a healthy
   pre-menopausal woman experiences decreased sexual function, hormonal
   contraception could be considered a possible cause and may be
   discontinued to determine if it is indeed a factor."

   But a spokeswoman for the UK's Family Planning Association said
   lifestyle factors such as stress, financial worries, how many children
   you have and alcohol and drug use could all affect a woman's sex drive.

   India cool on Kashmir proposals

   Indian soldiers on patrol in Kashmir
   Kashmiri moderates have welcomed the proposals

   India has asked Pakistan to discuss Kashmir through official channels
   only after its leader unveiled radical ideas to end years of conflict
   in the region.

   President Pervez Musharraf made an appeal for new thinking to end the
   two countries' dispute over the divided territory by peaceful means.

   Pakistani opposition parties reacted angrily but politicians within
   Kashmir itself welcomed the call.

   India suggested reporters should not be first to hear new proposals on
   Kashmir.

   It's a U-turn, a roll-back of Pakistan's policy on Kashmir since
   independence

   Hafiz Hussain Ahmed
   Pakistani opposition politician

   Mixed reception for rethink call

   "We do not believe that Jammu and Kashmir is a subject on which
   discussions can be held through the media," said foreign ministry
   spokesman Navtej Sarna.

   The territory was, he added, just "one of the subjects" in the
   negotiations between India and Pakistan which began this January.

   BBC News Online's Sanjoy Majumder, in Delhi, says Indian officials
   believe President Musharraf likes to score political points in public
   but is unyielding in his negotiations in private.

   Among the options the Pakistani leader suggested were joint rule over
   the territory or its re-division.

   He also said Pakistan's traditional demand for a referendum was
   impractical while India's bid to create a permanent border between the
   two parts of Kashmir was unacceptable.

   'U-turn'

   The BBC's Zaffar Abbas, in Islamabad, says the president's bold new
   initiative took the whole of Pakistan by surprise.

   This is the boldest step taken by any leader in South Asia

   Khurram Khan, Charlotte, NC, USA

   Send us your comments

   An alliance of six Islamic parties, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA),
   called the plan a "betrayal of the Kashmir cause".

   "It's a U-turn, a roll-back of Pakistan's policy on Kashmir since
   independence," MMA deputy leader Hafiz Hussain Ahmed told AFP news
   agency.

   "Whatever the ideas, he should have put them forward in parliament."

   Raja Zafarul Haq, a senior leader of the opposition Alliance for the
   Restoration of Democracy, said Mr Musharraf's proposals were "not in
   the interest of Pakistan and the Kashmiris".

   Kashmiris react

   In the Pakistani-administered part of Kashmir, Prime Minister Sardar
   Sikandar Hayat said he was disappointed by the president's comments on
   a referendum and also a suggestion that it could be divided over again.

   "We believe in a plebiscite, the one which was promised to us by both
   Pakistan and India," he said, referring to a 1948 UN Security Council
   resolution calling for a referendum which was accepted by both states.

   "Now, after five decades, they are talking about disintegration of
   Kashmir into six, seven parts."

   In the Indian part of Kashmir, the leader of a hardline faction of the
   separatist All Party Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, said
   his supporters stood by their demand for self-determination.

   However, the leader of a moderate faction of Hurriyat welcomed
   President Musharraf's proposals.

   Abdul Gani Bhat said they would be acceptable to India, Pakistan and
   the Kashmiris alike, and could usher in lasting peace and an era of
   prosperity.

   Radical plan

   Our correspondent in Islamabad says the intense debate is exactly what
   President Musharraf would have hoped for when he unveiled his radical
   proposals.

   Speaking on Monday, the president said himself that he had "never
   spoken like this before to anyone".

   "If both sides continue to stick to their stands, the dispute would
   persist for 100 years without any solution," he added.

   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since
   independence over Kashmir, since when they have both acquired nuclear
   arsenals.

   John Peel: Your tributes

   John Peel

   John Peel, veteran radio presenter and DJ, has died suddenly on holiday
   in South America.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Your third page of comments:

   I loved that man. Very cool guy, even when he was being deliberately
   and devoutly uncool.
   Crow, Bristol, England.

   All other airwaves were wall-to-wall formulaic pop

   Godfrey Bartlett, Brentwood, England

   Back in the late 60s John was the only way some kids could hear
   'underground' music. All other airwaves were wall-to-wall formulaic
   pop. His ear for good sounds was revolutionary. He certainly changed my
   life. I remember as a teenager hearing Tonto's Expanding Headband,
   Velvet Underground, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Loudon Wainwright III for the
   very first time on Radio One's 'Top Gear'. He was a man of integrity:
   true to himself and his listeners for over 3 decades. Rest easy, John.
   Godfrey Bartlett, Brentwood, England

   What an awful shock. It feels like a friend has died. Saturday mornings
   aren't going to be nearly so cosy. My deepest sympathy to his family -
   how lucky we all were to have him.
   Charlotte , Birmingham

   Like the music he played he was a one-off

   Neil Dyble, Poole, Dorset

   John's radio shows were always an oasis against the mainstream desert.
   A refuge for the otherwise voiceless. A celebration of pioneering music
   from all over the world. I owe a large part of my CD collection to him.
   Like the music he played he was a one-off. Thank you.
   Neil Dyble, Poole, Dorset

   John has always strived for a strong and diverse approach to music, and
   will be missed. I recall seeing him on TV lately, explaining what the
   word "love" meant. When he talked about his wife Sheila, he welled up.
   What a super man.
   Su Friend, Ascot, Berkshire

   A true individual. His depth of knowledge and willingness to play
   anything as long as it sounded good will mean that his passing will
   leave a huge void in the British music scene. He'll be sorely missed.
   Craig Mudie, Dundee, Scotland

   I was introduced to John Peel by my father when I was about eleven or
   twelve (now almost 40) and have listened to him ever since. I never met
   him but he introduced me to many of my favourite bands as he did for
   countless others around the world. I know he will be greatly missed and
   I send all my sympathy to his wife and family.
   Rachel Dean-Titterrell, London

   This man changed the nature of broadcasting not once but throughout his
   working life

   John, Brighton, UK

   Irreplaceable, this man changed the nature of broadcasting not once but
   throughout his working life. I doubt he is replaceable and hope the BBC
   will continue to broadcast his thoughts and words for as long as the
   archive exists. Farewell, I have lost an intelligent, incisive but most
   of all entertaining friend.
   John, Brighton, UK

   Although I never met John I felt I actually knew him. He was totally
   natural in his enthusiasm for music and his attitude to 'celebrity'. My
   condolences to his family.
   Giles, London, UK

   John will be sorely missed by many, many people. Unmistakable voice,
   unparalleled music taste and in inspiration to me. My thoughts to his
   friends and family. RIP
   Phil P, Herts

   You will never be forgotten

   Julie Bassett, Loughborough

   I am absolutely gutted, the best Disc Jockey in the world has left us.
   Thank you John for introducing me to so many bands and new genres of
   music. You will never be forgotten. RIP
   Julie Bassett, Loughborough

   He invented alternative music and helped me through my difficult teen
   years - John Peel saved my life, will miss him greatly
   Graeme Marsh, Glasgow

   What am I going to listen to now? Stunned...
   Neil, Brooklyn, NY

   Totally shocked, JP came closer to changing my life than any other
   person in the music industry. Genuinely a huge loss. My sympathies to
   Sheila and family
   Dave, Bristol

   A true gent and the only risk-taker left in radio worldwide. Your
   passing will leave a huge hole in many, many lives, including mine.
   Love to the family.
   Darren Parry, Holyhead, Anglesey

   Deadpan self-deprecation, sensitivity and - just occasionally -
   grumpiness

   Pads, London

   He made a unique contribution to Radio 4 as well as to Radio 1. His
   Saturday-morning monologues were a tour de force of deadpan
   self-deprecation, sensitivity and - just occasionally - grumpiness.
   Listening to him in full flow was like having a conversation with an
   old mate - an absolute delight.
   Pads, London

   Tragic for his family, a great shame for the rest of us that we won't
   hear him playing great new music into his 70s. I remember him playing
   what became "grunge" before anyone had heard of Nirvana, and he was the
   first person anywhere to play "Groove is in the Heart" on the radio,
   still the best ever dance track. Only last week I was listening to a
   recording of the 25th anniversary festive 50 quiz with Jarvis Cocker
   and Billy Bragg among the contestants - most entertaining, and a shame
   that there won't be another festive 50.
   Dominic, Leeds

   I'll never forget what he did for alternative music. From Napalm Death
   to Autechre he discovered the real bands far from mainstream.
   Condolences to the family
   Stefano, Roma Italy

   Never once did you get the impression that he was 'just doing a job'

   Gareth, Torquay, England

   John Peel has, more than any single person, shaped my musical tastes
   and thus hundreds of life changing experiences as a result. Everything
   about his work told of a man who lived for the joy of what he loved the
   most, music and his family. Never once did you get the impression that
   he was 'just doing a job', never once did you feel he was doing it for
   the status. My thanks and thoughts are with your family. Bless you John
   Peel
   Gareth, Torquay, England

   Hard to believe that the man I used to listen to under the bedcovers
   and who introduced me to music that my parents wouldn't like is no
   longer with us. I will really miss his voice.
   Rachel Rogers, Weymouth, UK

   John Peel phoned me up once to tell me that he loved the CD of my band
   that I'd just sent him. I couldn't believe it. He was a fantastic,
   utterly unique man, and his love of music did nothing less than enrich
   the cultural life of this country. He will be sadly missed.
   Steven, London

   What a shock and what a loss! I discovered John Peel when I was about
   15 years old, and used to sit in my bedroom with the radio glued to my
   ear listening to his late night programmes. He and Annie Nightingale
   were responsible for shaping my music tastes very early on!! I am now
   nearly 40, and recently found myself driving back late one night, once
   again listening to John on a late night radio show, playing fantastic
   music, and the years, it felt, had melted away!! He will be greatly
   missed.
   Felicity Hyde-Thompson, Brighton, England

   Simply the best DJ ever

   Stuart, Birmimgham, UK

   I am completely shocked. His voice will be sorely missed. Without
   doubt, simply the best DJ ever. Our thoughts are with his family at
   this sad time.
   Stuart, Birmingham, UK

   What a sad day. The news has come as too much of a shock for me to
   recall the pleasure his choice of music has given me over the years. I
   am thinking of the pain that Sheila and his children must be feeling,
   and of the grandfatherly love which Archie will now be deprived.
   Christopher Murray, Baltinglass, Ireland

   I feel genuinely upset by the sudden death of John Peel. He was such a
   genuine voice of Britain, so familiar, so wryly funny and so comforting
   for so many years. British broadcasting will not be the same without
   him.
   Harriet, London

   His massive enthusiasm for new music was simply incredible

   J, Cambridge, UK

   All my early music memories and influences are down to 2 people - my
   elder brother who I had to share a bedroom with and John Peel. And I
   suspect that really means it's all down to John Peel. I remember my
   brother playing me the things he'd taped from the JP show, Stackridge
   to The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, Viv Stanshall to the Strawbs... then
   when I got my own radio and could stay up and listen it seemed like the
   World opened up. His massive enthusiasm for new music was simply
   incredible. Such very sad news. A truly wonderful voice of music gone
   from the airwaves.
   J, Cambridge, UK

   Now where will we listen to music, bourne of personal taste (a trusted
   opinion), instead of music based on demographics, sales and
   inexperience. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.
   Ed Wilson, London UK

   Thanks Peely for all you've done for the alternative side of music -
   the world will be a quieter place without you... Tonight as a tribute
   to the great man, light a candle, dig out your Undertones albums ...and
   get Teenage kicks right through the night .
   Dave, Sheffield

   To hear one of his broadcasts was the same as listening to an old
   friend

   John Pearce, Bolton, England

   A truly remarkable man. It was impossible to listen to him and not
   think you were the only person in the world he was speaking to. To hear
   one of his broadcasts was the same as listening to an old friend and it
   was difficult to believe that he did not know you and that you were not
   a friend of his. He had a perfect radio voice, a perfect radio manner
   and a superb ability to make anything sound interesting. He played the
   best music and he definitely, at times, played the worst; but there was
   not one second of any of his broadcasts when he played or said
   something he did not care about. His radio shows sucked you in, in a
   manner few others have managed or will manage in the future. Everyone
   who listened to him lost a friend today, whether he knew them or not.
   John Pearce, Bolton, England

   As an impressionable and wide eyed teenager in the 70s JP opened up a
   brave new musical world which still lives with me today. I've just been
   told that you have died and couldn't believe it. They'll be a great gig
   in the sky. Condolences to the Peel family
   Rick, Croydon, UK

   A great loss. Very few people in broadcasting have his integrity. I owe
   him a debt of gratitude to introducing me to my favourite album. My
   thoughts go out to his family
   Steve H, London, UK

   I had the pleasure of meeting John and sharing a beer with him many
   times at the Reading Rock festival where I worked during the late 70s
   and early 80s. I will always remember the reading of the football
   results each Saturday at Reading. John you will be so missed by people
   who love real music.
   Paul Smith, London

   Don't get too peeved by all that celestial harp playing

   Pete Kozak, Santiago de Chile

   So John, you chose to leave us in Cuzco. An important focal point of
   Incan belief is that the divine resides in everything; you certainly
   helped a lot of us see and feel that it resides in music and song.
   Cheers mate, and don't get too peeved by all that celestial harp
   playing.
   Pete Kozak, Santiago de Chile

   I am so sad to hear this news. For me, he was the only reason to listen
   to Radio 1. I live in Tokyo at the moment but I was looking forward to
   returning home so that I could listen to more music from new artists,
   the like of which I would never have heard in today's "plastic" music
   scene of TV reality "idols" and cheesy pop acts. Good on you, John, for
   letting the music speak for itself! Rest in peace.
   Adam Spurr, Tokyo, Japan

   I had recently bought ELO's Out Of The Blue just a few weeks before I
   first heard John Peel in 1976. Just think where my taste could have
   gone without him...? It's a very sad day for genuine learning.
   Condolences.
   Matt Peach, Bath, UK

   In the words of Tom Petty - "There goes the last DJ"
   Darren, Lewes

   John Peel - father of the musical taste of millions

   Julian Coleman, Leicester

   Never imagined I'd see the day we'd have to live in a world without
   him. I simply can't believe I won't ever hear that voice again, saying
   "I've just got this demo tape from a band calling themselves Heavy
   Plank Consortium" or some such, after which he would play you something
   new and different and beautiful and exciting. There never was anyone to
   come close to him. I'm afraid there probably never will be. I hope him
   and Marc Bolan are sharing a few beers and a joke right now. God bless
   you John Peel father of the musical taste of millions.
   Julian Coleman, Leicester

   I have diaries from the 70's that list, not my life, but who John Peel
   had on session every night. His influence on British music was so total
   that I fear for the future. It's impossible to describe how much he
   will be missed. A very sad day indeed.
   Gary Cameron, Aberdeen

   A genuine 'nice guy' who had done so much for the music industry and
   influenced so many. He will be sadly missed by many.
   Paul Alderwick, Gosport, UK

   John supported the underdogs - the otherwise neglected genres of music
   not profitable enough for modern radio. In doing so, he gave promoters
   (like us), bands, and venues everywhere the means and inspiration to
   carry on. He'll be dearly missed by all. I hope Radio 1 at least
   attempt to replace him with someone fit to carry his mantle.
   Dave, Newport, Wales

   John's happy relaxed style was a tonic to all

   Chris Fairweather, Ipswich

   John's happy relaxed style was a tonic to all. A great personality and
   presenter. May his family find comfort.
   Chris Fairweather, Ipswich

   In a world full of superlatives when every halfway decent footballer is
   called a "genius" and the word "hero" is (used to describe someone who
   achieves the mediocre John Peel was an ordinary bloke whose enthusiasm
   and integrity were truly something to be admired. He was everything
   that I want in a DJ. My thought go out to "the Pig" and the kids who he
   (despite his grumpy old man act) all to evidently loved and was hugely
   proud of.
   Ron, Cambridge

   I have come to admire John Peel not only because of his enormous
   contribution to the music industry, but also because of his balanced,
   pragmatic approach to life, his wry sense of humour and the sincere,
   sensitive and open-minded approach he adopted with the people he met.
   He will be sorely missed.
   Bronwen Jones, Blandford, UK

   A sad day for music, Peely has been on the radio in and around my house
   all my life, a voice that brought a new road into life through his god
   inspired choice and none inhibition of sound that will reverberate
   through the memories of my past and into my future, RIP a man connected
   to the Ether, definitely. See you again some time good man.
   Vic Ross,

   The voice of a lifetime - from rebellious youth to well-modulated
   middle age

   Imogen Holt, Liskeard, Cornwall

   The voice of a lifetime - from rebellious youth to well-modulated
   middle age, John's dependable, affable 'purr' said it all! Deepest love
   to Sheila and the family who he so obviously and publicly adored.
   Imogen Holt, Liskeard, Cornwall

   Probably the most iconic, and influential DJ I ever heard. Only the
   good die young.
   Tim E, Bristol, UK

   John's been the voice of new music ever since I can remember. He, along
   with a few of his Radio 1 colleagues, introduced me to my favourite
   bands both present and past. I've a tear in my eye at the thought I'll
   never hear his dulcet tones again - I'll be playing Teenage Kicks
   loudly in my house tonight, in tribute to the greatest radio voice
   we've ever had.
   Alan, Aberdeen, Scotland

   Thank you for being the person you were. You will be missed and
   remembered with affection.
   Rebecca Dittman, Liverpool UK

   I am eternally grateful to him for helping form my varied taste in
   music

   Mark Cosgrove, Epsom Surrey

   What a sad day. He will be missed. I grew up listening to 'Peelie' and
   I am eternally grateful to him for helping form my varied taste in
   music.
   Mark Cosgrove, Epsom Surrey

   His death is a huge loss to the wide world of music. He can never be
   matched.
   Martin, Prague, Czech Republic

   I'd like to express my deepest condolences to John's wife and family,
   he will be sadly missed. As one of the insomniacs who listened to the
   Monday night repeat of Home Truths, I will miss the friendly voice of
   experience. Goodbye John.
   Heather, Merseyside, UK

   Radio will not be the same! Who else would play death metal alongside
   techno followed by indie? A true character the city of Liverpool can be
   proud of! We will miss you John Peel
   Phil, Bolton

   Who else could have given us the likes of Mark Bolan, David Bowie,
   Siouxie and the Banshees but Mr John Peel. Rest peacefully John.
   Rachel, Birmingham, England

   Huge eclectism in musical taste and a champion of sound

   Jack Harris, Knutsford, England

   Who else would play a Big Band record from the 50s next to a current
   banging techno tune. Huge eclecticism in musical taste and a champion
   of sound. I will miss his weekly Radio 1 slots a lot. My thoughts are
   with his family at this difficult time.
   Jack Harris, Knutsford, England

   I hope you guys at the BBC are going to give us a seriously big tribute
   to Peely because he meant so much to so many people - many nights I
   fell asleep listening to his show - its like losing one of the family -
   I can't stop crying. David - ex Liverpool
   ,

   I started listening to John Peel as a 13 year old in 1982, and its no
   exaggeration to say that he shaped a vast chunk of my cultural life.
   There was no facade or pretence with the man (whatever his original
   background was), he always came across as a genuinely warm, modest,
   decent human being. Above all, he had a sincere love of music which he
   passed on to countless listeners...
   Ifti, London, UK

   Unmistakable. Influential. Unsurpassable. Irreplaceable. Legendary.
   Groundbreaking. Warm. Friendly. RIP
   Rich, Peterborough, UK

   Respect to this towering legend

   Simon, Huddersfield, W.Yorks

   He always remained the older friend who taught you all about music. For
   most of us the only tangible and real wisdom in the BBC, has now
   departed. Respect to this towering legend the like of which we can only
   dream of happening again... Sympathies to his nearest and dearest.
   Simon, Huddersfield, W.Yorks.

   I am deeply saddened by John's early death. Home Truths has long been
   one of the highlights of my weekend. My thoughts are with Sheila and
   the family.
   Alison, London, UK

   In the 1960's John Peel was my inspiration. Wherever I was, whatever I
   was doing, I would make sure I always listened to 'The Perfumed
   Garden'. To the incredible music, the engaging anecdotes and the
   wondrous ramblings of a most marvellous and inspirational man. Over all
   the years you have meant so much. God bless you John, I'll miss you.
   Jess Roden, Middlesex

   Saturday mornings will never be the same again

   Caroline, Oxford, UK

   His presenting of Home Truths on Radio 4 was one of the wittiest, most
   entertaining and thought provoking programmes on the air. Saturday
   mornings will never be the same again.
   Caroline, Oxford, UK

   Shocking news and a great feeling of personal loss. Memories of
   listening to Festive 50's will stick with me forever, as will those
   early days of musical discovery for me, led by John Peel, and a
   transistor radio hidden under my pillow - my thoughts are with his
   family
   Ian, Bath, UK

   So we will never hear again the dulcet tones of John Peel late at night
   on the Radio. We will never hear his next musical selection and ponder
   on his incisive comments. John Peel was one of the great DJ's, his
   passing is the end of an era. The music world is a poorer place without
   him.
   Ray Murtagh, Hull

   Whatever else was going on in the world JP was a constant

   Trevor, Cambs, UK

   John Peel seemed to have been a part of my life for ever but now he has
   gone and life will be all the poorer for it. Whatever else was going on
   in the world JP was a constant and someone to whom I will be forever
   grateful as the man who exposed me to King Crimson. Rock on JP.
   Trevor, Cambs, UK

   His influence on British music - particularly the cutting edge - cannot
   be overestimated. He made a real difference and it's difficult to see
   who'll replace him. And this was a man who played The Fall regularly on
   radio - for that alone he should have been knighted! He'll be sorely
   missed.
   Paul, Nottingham

   Without John Peel, most of my favourite bands would still be working in
   an office somewhere. If that isn't enough, JP was one of the last
   remaining people in the media whose opinion I wanted to hear. He was an
   absolute one-off. We truly will never see his like again.
   Stuart Smith, Amstelveen, The Netherlands

   John Peel introduced me to a plethora of bands I would never have seen
   or heard: Soft Machine, Third Eye Band, Principle Edwards Magic Theatre
   and on and on. I may have left Britain more than 30 years ago but can
   say that the music the great man introduced me to, is still with me.
   Thanks JP and RIP!
   Mervo, Wiarton, Canada

   The death of John Peel is a truly saddening event for music lovers all
   over the world, and I was deeply moved by the news. He was a real
   pioneer and had knocked out genuinely new and vibrant music on BBC
   Radio 1 since before I was born right up until the present. The number
   of musicians who owe their careers in part or in full to the enthusiasm
   of John must be beyond measure. John was without doubt one of the very
   few people without whom the world would have been genuinely and
   consistently worse off, and I hope, I trust, that he will be remembered
   for many years to come.
   Barry S, Manchester UK

   His distinctive Liverpudlian monotone, always modest, yet always
   interesting

   Robin Smith, Cortlandt, New York, USA

   As a schoolboy in 1970s Britain, John was always cool and avant garde
   and was always on the cusp of what was happening in music. Amazingly he
   stayed that way until his death - always with his distinctive
   Liverpudlian monotone, always modest, yet always interested and
   interesting. A great loss to young and old listeners everywhere!
   Robin Smith, Cortlandt, New York, USA

   Listening to Peel in the late 70's was a secret world that Grown Ups
   didn't know about and spoke to you. He was the first Grown Up I'd heard
   that "knew", like a favourite uncle. Last year I bumped into him on the
   street and, without thinking, shook his hand saying "John Peel! Thank
   you!" He looked slightly bemused but not angry... like a favourite
   uncle.
   Carl Stickley, London, UK

   John was an genuine influence on myself & almost all of my friends
   since we were in our early teenage years, supplying us with a such a
   diverse range of music that no-one else dared to. He had a personality
   that went beyond the airwaves & seemed a genuinely good man. You will
   be missed.
   Hugh Matthews, Glasgow

   He was both witty and considerate to his interviewees

   Phil Murphy, Maynooth, Ireland

   'Home Truths' was probably my favourite show on BBC Radio; it summed up
   the character and integrity of a man that I had great admiration for.
   He was both witty and considerate to his interviewees, and I will miss
   his unique charisma. We have lost a great man and nobody, anywhere,
   will fill his shoes.
   Phil Murphy, Maynooth, Ireland

   Thanks for your sessions. They are like a treasure for all the people
   who like good music. It was also a means for foreigners to discover the
   best bands.
   Ronan, Brittany (France)

   Since I first listened to The Perfumed Garden, John Peel has been my
   touchstone for music, introducing me to all that's good, some that's
   bad, but never was a moment wasted while listening to his shows. My
   sympathies to his family, and his massive extended family of listeners.
   James Smith, UK

   I met John Peel at gig he did in 1967 at Manchester University and have
   followed his career and applauded his musical tastes ever since. I will
   miss his intelligent and thoughtful comments on music and life in
   general.
   Peter Milloy, Buckden, Cambridgeshire

   The day the music died

   Simon Evans, Mountain Ash, Wales

   Farewell John. The day the music died.
   Simon Evans, Mountain Ash, Wales

   Every fortnight I drive a 100 mile round trip to collect my children
   for the weekend. Listening to John made that journey for all of us. Our
   Saturday's will never be the same. God bless
   Rod, Cambridge, UK

   His true influence will probably never be known, and the legacy he
   leaves behind for us is massive. No doubt he will still be playing
   records at the wrong speed on that great radio station in the sky.
   Steven & Julie, Leyland

   I'm heartbroken.. This man has possibly done more than any other to
   introduce me, and the nation, to the best and most important music of
   the last 40 years. He's one of the few public individuals who deserve
   the accolade of "national treasure". I had the privilege of spending
   the entire Anti-Criminal Justice bill march in conversation with him,
   and he was every inch the man I'd hoped - passionate, caring, committed
   and modest. His words to me when I asked if he was speaking at the
   event were "Oh no, I just like to turn up and offer a bit of support at
   these things. I'm sure there are far more important people with things
   to say here than me". he'd missed out on a weekend at home with the
   family to go on the march on his own.. A hero and an example to all of
   us..
   Malcolm Boyle, London, England

   He was one of the most modest, entertaining and influential of music
   broadcasters

   Mark, Liverpool, England

   Long, long after his 10pm slot saw me through my teenage years I could
   still rely on a fresh musical outlook whenever I happened upon his
   voice during a long night drive home. He was one of the most modest,
   entertaining and influential of music broadcasters. Condolences to
   John's family and friends at their sudden and untimely loss.
   Mark, Liverpool, England

   My deepest condolences to the family. John's love of music and his down
   to earth manner and attitude have rubbed off on millions of people
   worldwide. Many a band have broken into success through his painstaking
   efforts to play as much variety of music as possible not because it was
   fashionable - but because he liked it! A genius and a gentleman, he
   will be surely missed.
   Owen Davies, Llanelli, Wales

   Oh no not Peelie, he was one of the good guys!
   Ringo, Bristol

   I can genuinely say that I am gutted to hear this news - I have listen
   to John Peel for the past 20 years first on Radio 1 then the World
   Service and Radio 4 - he will be greatly missed
   Matthew Curtis, Knebworth

   This is the first time I have ever written into one of these things,
   but for Jon Peel it is worth it

   Ted , Oxford

   I heard on Radio 4 at 2pm that somebody involved with Radio 1 for a
   long time had died, but I didn't catch the name. I turned over to Radio
   1 and they were playing Teenage Kicks by the Undertones and knew
   immediately it must have been John Peel. This is the first time I have
   ever written into one of these things, but for Jon Peel it is worth it.
   There will no doubt be lots of clichés about what a nice bloke he was.
   I never met him, but I am sure they would all be true.
   Ted , Oxford

   John Peel was a legend - a man in the public eye who actually seemed
   like a genuinely decent bloke. What a sad loss to British broadcasting.
   RIP John
   Spook, Wales

   The fact that he had been doing what he is doing since 1967 without
   anyone else coming close to being half as good as him says it all.
   There is a huge hole in the contemporary music scene without him.
   Grace, Orpington, Kent

   For championing The Smiths and the amusement he gave me on Top of the
   Pops in the 80's, he was a true great.
   Kevin Lloyd, Manchester, England

   Without John Peel I wouldn't be working in the music industry

   James, London, UK

   I am so shocked. Peel was my inspiration behind a lifetime of listening
   to music. He turned me onto so many new bands, genres and sounds. He
   has championed so many new forms of music and kick started the careers
   of so many musicians. Without John Peel I wouldn't be working in the
   music industry. It's a job I love and I owe a massive debt to this
   inspirational man. RIP
   James, London, UK

   Gonna miss those awful shorts on the Glastonbury coverage. And grumpy
   old men won't be the same.
   Cillian O' Neill, Rugby, England

   I met the great man once. He had a rotten cold but took the time to
   talk to me - mainly about Liverpool FC! He then played Release the Bats
   for me. A true gentleman. He will be missed so much.
   Andrew , Farnham

   As a constant listener to Home Truths and having listened to the
   eagerness with which John was looking forward to the holiday I find
   this huge loss hard to comprehend. It is really sad.
   Gordon Rawcliffe, London

   A warm heart is sometimes hard to find in the media industry

   Johan Sorensen, Farnham UK

   I was interviewed by Mr Peel on Home Truths with my family. It was a
   piece on addiction. It was a very difficult subject and he handled it
   with such ease and grace. A warm heart is sometimes hard to find in the
   media industry, but he was one of them.
   Johan Sorensen, Farnham UK

   A great man. He sent me three postcards in reply to letters I sent. He
   didn't have to. The world of music is more interesting for his presence
   and probably will be duller hereafter. Above all a truly decent, witty
   lovely man. RIP John
   Steven Banks, Paris, France

   Simply the coolest old guy in the world ever.
   Will, Lancaster

   What he didn't know about music wasn't worth knowing, thanks for the
   teenage kicks, RIP mate.
   Michael Lloyd, Cardiff, Wales

   I'll be giving "Teenage Kicks" a loud blast while I drink to your
   memory

   Rob Brook, Blackpool, UK

   John, you were the last hope of hearing proper music on the radio. I'll
   be giving "Teenage Kicks" a loud blast while I drink to your memory.
   Rest well, we'll all miss you!
   Rob Brook, Blackpool, UK

   You start off listening to John Peel for the music he plays, but as you
   get older you just listen to the programme for him and the music
   becomes secondary.
   Duncan, Cardiff Wales

   The world's best DJ, bar none. An irreplaceable loss to music. Heaven
   now has someone to spin some mean sounds.
   Steve, Harrogate

   For many years often the sole voice of taste in the wilderness of
   mainstream radio. Our musical culture heritage would have been
   immensely impoverished but for his influence. He will be sadly missed.
   Colin, Oxford

   He gave a credible voice to underground and independent music of all
   genres - such a terrible loss.
   Sparkle, London, UK

   Rock in Peace

   Justin Cooke, Tunbridge Wells, England

   How many sixty four year old men can introduce one of the finest
   programs on Radio Four on a Saturday morning before going on to DJ at
   the world's coolest club on a Saturday night? John Peel was the type of
   man that makes me proud to be British. God bless you John and Rock in
   Peace.
   Justin Cooke, Tunbridge Wells, England

   I can never hear his voice on any media without stopping and tuning in.
   He just had so much to say that was so good to hear
   Tony Hill, New Malden Surrey

   Unique, irreplaceable and a part of my entire radio listening life. I
   am deeply saddened by his passing but without him I would not have such
   a wide and varied musical library. Thank you, Peelie.
   Stuart, UK

   John Peel seemed to have been a part of my life for ever but now he has
   gone and life will be all the poorer for it. Whatever else was going on
   in the world JP was a constant and someone to whom I will be forever
   grateful as the man who exposed me to King Crimson. Rock on JP.
   Trevor, Cambs, UK

   This man was the father and shepherd of the music scene that defined a
   whole generation

   Alex Fernandez, London England

   John Peel had a profound impact on my life. I would never have loved
   this country the way that I do had it not been for his influence, via
   the weekly programmes he made during the late 1970's. He exposed me to
   the music that defined my identity and made me who I am today. Truly,
   without "Uncle John", I would be a completely different, and lesser
   person. This man was the father and shepherd of the music scene that
   defined a whole generation. What a great and insightful man. The debt
   that I owe him is truly enormous. Goodbye John Peel, you were truly
   inspirational.
   Alex Fernandez, London England

   The sky has gained a bright, bright star.
   Katie, London

   I am gutted. I will miss him playing 30s Jazz followed by a black metal
   followed by techno. All at the wrong speed. The man was a genius, and
   the only reason to listen to the radio. RIP Mr Peel. The world is a
   worse place without you
   John, Hove

   By some considerable distance the greatest Radio DJ to ever live. The
   world of music (not just that that is popular) is a much, much poorer
   place today. What a shame we won't get to hear his views any more. RIP.
   Dr Cameron Sweet, Warwick, UK

   My Saturday morning drive won't ever be same. My condolences to his
   wife and family, I feel I know them all.
   Sandra, Bucks

   What other presenter would earn tributes from Radio 1 and Radio 4
   listeners?

   Steve, Dover, UK

   What other presenter would earn tributes from Radio 1 and Radio 4
   listeners? Now I won't have any excuse for staying in bed on Saturday
   mornings. I felt like John's family were my family too. Our hearts go
   out to Sheila and the children.
   Steve, Dover, UK

   Influential, legendary and original. He will be sorely missed by
   generations of listeners.
   Howard Cardinal, London, UK

   He was a star of man, he brought generations together and he opened all
   our minds to world music.
   Gavin Steele, Liverpool

   Unrivalled in his support for all types of musicians. He gave them the
   chances when no one else would. I have enjoyed his shows on Radio 1 for
   25 years and he will be sorely missed by his fans and the bands he has
   helped over his illustrious career. What will I tune to at night, on an
   open road?
   Mark Elliker, Aldridge, West Midlands

   My heart goes out to his family and all those who loved him

   Tim, Oxford, UK

   For many years the Peel Sessions were absolutely the only access to the
   music scene in the UK for Americans such as myself. It is not an
   overstatement to say that without Mr Peel my life and many other
   Americans would have been severely diminished. It is just so sad. My
   heart goes out to his family and all those who loved him.
   Tim, Oxford UK

   John Peel was the music industry's red hot poker. Without him,
   innovation and all that's weird and wonderful would've dried up decades
   ago.
   Simon, Amsterdam, Netherlands

   Gonna miss those awful shorts on the Glastonbury coverage. And grumpy
   old men won't be the same.
   Cillian O' Neill, Rugby, England

   Just so very sad, when i was 15 (1980) he was the only one playing the
   music I loved. He truly is an icon. My thoughts go to his family whose
   loss must be so much greater than that who only new him through music.
   Love and peace
   Mark Fudge, London

   Sitting in my bedroom listening to him, he seemed a beacon in the
   darkness

   Simon, Woolaston, UK

   I've still got compilation tapes of punk and new wave tracks he played
   in the 70s, the only DJ doing so at the time. Sitting in my bedroom
   listening to him, he seemed a beacon in the darkness. A great man.
   Simon, Woolaston, UK

   What a sad loss for the entire country. His unique style and
   understanding in knowing what appealed to his listeners will be almost
   impossible to replace. His constant references to Sheila demonstrated
   his total commitment to her and she, along with the rest of their
   family, will hopefully gain some comfort in the knowledge that he
   touched so many other lives.
   Michael Overlander, Stanmore

   A terrible loss to the broadcast world and to music journalism. He was
   a one-off.
   Alex Norman, Westcliff-on-Sea

   Truly one of the few gifted DJ's who could spot good music in any
   genre. Never afraid to play something different, John Peel's opinions
   and contributions were and still are respected by generations of
   pan-generic music lovers, just as he was respected as a lover of music.
   Cheers, John.
   Daniel, London

   80% of my record collection is a result of listening to his show

   Karen, Greece

   John Peel was a true legend whose influence on the record buying habits
   of several generations is immeasurable. I reckon 80% of my record
   collection is a result of listening to his show. A very sad day indeed.
   Karen, Greece

   My life, like that of thousands of others, would have been so much
   poorer without Peelie. A decent man who merited the respect and
   affection his listeners had for him. He'll be hugely missed, and music
   will be the worse for his loss.
   Adrian, London

   Gone are the late night drives listening to the most eclectic mix of
   music I've ever been blessed to listen too! Radio will miss that voice.
   At least now the saying is true, God is a DJ!
   Gavin, Altrincham, England

   Farewell John Peel. You were a true DJ and broadcaster, the rest have a
   lot to learn from your devotion, honesty, and style. Our loss is
   heaven's gain.
   Dr. Simon Minkoff, London, England

   The show always revealed how young at heart he was

   Paul Harriss, London

   I was very saddened to read that John Peel has gone to the Great Gig in
   the Sky. I shall miss the quirkiness of Home Truths, the eccentricity
   of the Great British Public (or at least some of us) and his great
   sense of humour. How ironic that only a couple of weeks ago John should
   refer to collecting his bus pass - until then I had no idea he was 65
   as the show always revealed how young at heart he was. Nevertheless, 65
   is still far too young to lose a personality and talent as great as
   John's. Sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.
   Paul Harriss, London

   Just want to say, how very sad I am to hear the news about John Peel.
   He'll be missed.
   Bex, England

   I would like to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the late John
   Peel. I am sure that I will not be the only one to want to express the
   joy he gave over the years with his innovative musical tastes and the
   constant ability to introduce listeners to new, and sometimes obscure,
   bands and musicians. If it wasn't for John, I wouldn't have developed
   my own wide musical tastes for bands such as Half-Man Half-Biscuit and
   the much under rated (and bizarrely titled) Danny Glover Fridge
   Foundation. His eclecticism will be sadly missed.
   Kevin Rush, Scotland

   There are few people who span the generation gap in the way that John
   Peel has always managed. His open minded approach to music was only
   matched by his humble approach to his audience. He will be greatly
   missed.
   Derek Mayne, Northamptonshire, UK

   Radio 1 will never be the same again

   David Meller, Stockport

   I honestly want to cry at the moment. Radio 1 will never be the same
   again. No, come to think of it, alternative music radio will never be
   the same again.
   David Meller, Stockport

   Big shock. John was the only person who was responsible for introducing
   me to so many different types of music. African, Punk, Reggae, Grunge.
   John covered them all. It's sad to say that there isn't anyone who can
   fill his shoes... I'm sure his legend will live on!
   Kevin English, London, U.K.

   I have listened to John all my life, and his Radio 1 show was a part of
   growing up. He will be missed
   Peter Lovatt, Birmingham

   John Peel was single handily responsible for my early musical
   education. He introduced me as a teenager to King Crimson, Neil Young,
   Lynyrd Skynyrd and countless others who never got daytime play. Who can
   forget his Christmas "festive 50" of listener voted tracks in the '70's
   (Layla by Derek and the Domino's was always no. 2, and Stairway to
   Heaven by Led Zeppelin was always no. 1). He played punk before anybody
   else (who remembers Eddy and the Hot Rods?), and was always genuinely
   interesting to listen to. Well done John, well done!
   John, England

   He will be sadly missed by many and leave a huge hole in my listening
   schedule.
   Daniel Ortonious, London, England

   I was stuck in a homeless hostel for 18 months and all that kept me
   just sane was John Peel

   Andy, London

   I was stuck in a homeless hostel for 18 months and all that kept me
   just sane was John Peel's Radio One show every weekday evening. What a
   loss.
   Andy, London

   I've just heard the news about John Peel and am in tears. I can't
   believe it. Peel was my guru when I was a teenage indie kid and he
   remained a favourite ever since. You were the boss, mate.
   Siv, London

   I can't believe it. My heart goes out to Shelia and his family. A
   totally irreplaceable person in every respect. I was only listening to
   him this morning singing "Pedro the Fisherman" with the producers
   laughing in the background. Totally irreplaceable. He will be sorely
   missed. 17 years I had been listening to him for.
   Stuart Hirons, Blackburn, Lancashire

   I'm sure I have similar memories to everyone else - the main one being
   as a kid, under the duvet, with a radio on listening to exciting new
   music that you couldn't hear anywhere else. Not only was the music
   amazing, but it felt like your mate (or kindly uncle perhaps) was
   presenting it, making witty comments all the way through. The records
   played at the wrong speed just added to the level of endearment. There
   was also the presenting at Glastonbury on TV but more importantly the
   feeling that John Peel was an all round great bloke. He was a legend.
   Hope he's getting his teenage kicks somewhere else now.
   Simon Harris, London, UK

   What an enormous loss to broadcasting and the music world

   Ray, Manchester, UK

   What an enormous loss to broadcasting and the music world. John's voice
   was one of the most familiar on Radio and TV and his informal, witty
   and somewhat wry manner endeared him to music fans since the early
   sixties. Here is an instance of someone who really will be missed by
   millions of fans and admirers as well as fellow professionals.
   Ray, Manchester, UK

   A hero, legend, mentor, god! You'll be sadly missed John.
   Chris Learmouth, Bedford, England

   Whether it was discovering an entire world of sounds that I never even
   knew existed, or being inspired to join the Anthony Nolan bone marrow
   trust by his equally unusual Home Truths, his inspiration to celebrate
   yourself for who you are will live on.
   Jamie Macdonald, Avalon Australia

   John Peel's cutting edge musical ear unearthed many a great talent

   Gary Officer, Silver Spring, Maryland

   An absolute legend. An icon! Growing up in South London in the 1970's
   and 80's two radio DJ's stood head and shoulders above their peers.
   John Peel and David Rodigan. In a era of "packaged mainstream" music,
   John Peel's cutting edge musical ear unearthed many a great talent who
   would never made it out of garages, warehouses, and small clubs. May
   you rest in peace.
   Gary Officer, Silver Spring, Maryland

   I'm absolutely gutted, I've been joking for years with my friends how I
   wanted to adopt him as my new granddad, painfully unfunny now. The
   greatest ambassador music in Britain has ever had.
   Dan, Warwick

   I am truly, truly gutted by this news... John Peel was a warm and
   gentle man who will be genuinely missed... Bless you, John. My thoughts
   are with your family.
   Goffik, Southampton, UK

   Sadly missed, Saturday mornings will not be the same without him when
   doing battle to feed our 13 month daughter to your show.
   Pat Crew, Sudbury, Suffolk

   The man who sound tracked my isolated country upbringing

   Lei-Lei Jayenne, Walthamstow, London, UK

   The man who sound tracked my isolated country upbringing, introducing
   me, through his show, to music i would never have been exposed to
   otherwise. Truly radio's greatest, the man who had music coursing
   through his veins. RIP
   Lei-Lei Jayenne, Walthamstow, London, UK

   John Peel was an inspiration to many, He will be sadly missed for his
   diverse and open approach to music, RIP John you will be remembered for
   many years to come
   Leon H, Coventry

   Thank you John for a lifetime of pleasure, laughter, music, humanity
   since hiding under the bedclothes as a teenager to middle-aged secret
   wearing of headphones to hear strange music at strange times of the
   night. Thank you John. You stood for my generation and as such were
   loved so much. You went on to stand up for the next generation too.
   What a guy. I send strength to his nearest and dearest - remember how
   lucky you were to be close to him and how lucky he was to have you all
   to love.
   Gillian Menzies, London

   He was the Daddy of great music, in all shapes and forms

   James Irwin, Bristol, UK

   I am gutted. Quite simply, he was the Daddy of great music, in all
   shapes and forms, of the last 40 years. He is truly irreplaceable. My
   thoughts are with his friends, family and dedicated listeners.
   James Irwin, Bristol, UK

   Stunned and shocked. John Peel was a selfless champion of emerging
   bands for decades and the greatest DJ this country has ever known.
   Ray Hughes, Rainham, Kent

   I just read the news and I am totally gutted. John Peel is responsible
   in so many ways for the development of the UK music scene and also
   shaped my own musical tastes over the many years I have listened to his
   show. We are all big music fans in the office where I work and this
   afternoon has suddenly become very quiet and sombre. My heart felt
   wishes go out to John's family and friends, he will be sorely missed
   buy millions.
   Gary Bliss, Cirencester

   What can be said? Gutted.. Never have I felt this bad over someone I
   never actually knew. But that was the thing with John, he made you feel
   you did know him. My thoughts are with his family.
   Elton, Bham UK

   There's no-one to replace him

   Michael Fordham, Bath, England

   A truly sad day. JP was an inspiration, an object lesson in the
   possibility of remaining fluid, inspired, curious into later age and
   success. Introduced millions to new music and made the curious
   comforting on a Saturday morning with Home Truths. There's no-one to
   replace him.
   Michael Fordham, Bath, England

   John Peel's career spanned 40 years and his appeal spanned all age
   groups. He'll be sorely missed by all music lovers. My heartfelt
   sympathies to Shelia and his family.
   John, Southampton Hants

   John Peel will be sadly missed. As one of the key people responsible
   for bringing the heavy/death metal genre to the forefront of musical
   consciousness, the genre as a whole have lost a dear friend.
   Rick, Bradford, UK

   He was a hero to music. I didn't always like what I heard but he give
   us what we would be listening to months or years ahead of its time.
   I'll miss his accent not just from music but from his voice-over
   work...yes even all the ads.
   Martin, Belfast

   A champion of the underground music scene

   Jeff, London, UK

   I am deeply saddened to hear of John's death. As a musician and band
   member I know I'm not the only one who looked up to Mr Peel as a
   champion of the underground music scene. He will be sorely missed.
   Jeff, London, UK

   The end of an era! John Peel was for so long synonymous with the real
   "pop" culture, and somehow managed to stay current in all things to do
   with the music world, whilst most of us fell woefully behind. He will
   be sorely missed. My thoughts are with his family and close friends.
   Barry Green, Skipton, North Yorkshire

   A living legend, no one could present a radio show like him. A
   distinguished voice and a distinguished play list. He shall be missed.
   RIP
   Fraser Hamilton, Coventry

   All I can say is that I'm totally gutted. I almost cried when 6 music
   played "Teenage Kicks" after the announcement. You were the best John.
   Marcus Slade, Philadelphia USA

   Whenever he turned up on the television my friends and I would
   genuflect

   Sarah, London, UK

   Without John Peel I would never have heard Nirvana or The Smiths, never
   would have even realised there was an alternative music scene, never
   become such a passionate music fan, never experienced some of the most
   incredible music out there and never have realised that a song could
   change your life. I listened to him for years and his comforting voice
   and genuine love of music shone through in every show - whenever he
   turned up on the television my friends and I would genuflect on our
   hands and knees in sheer admiration. Thank you John for everything, at
   least they'll finally be listening to some decent music in heaven!
   Sarah, London, UK

   I remember when Liverpool won the European Cup. His show that night
   started with chiming bells instead of the usual theme tune. I reckon
   I've been listening to him on Radio 1 through to his radio 4 career for
   the past 25 years. It's the death of radio.
   Derek Macdonald, Musselburgh

   I'll never forget hearing the Sex Pistols for the first time listening
   on headphones under the covers from ten to midnight when I was a
   teenager. For magical memories and the greatest music, thanks John and
   Goodbye. You will be missed.
   Tim Haines, Evesham UK

   A serious loss to those grumpy old men that grew up to that new sound
   of punk......
   Andrew T, UK

   Now all we have to look forwards to is dull, unintelligent and fad
   influenced pretty faces

   Chris Byers, Preston, UK

   He is probably the last truly independent and non-corporate DJ. Now all
   we have to look forwards to is dull, unintelligent and fad influenced
   pretty faces to tell the kids what they should try listening too.
   You'll be sorely missed John.
   Chris Byers, Preston, UK

   A sad loss for music. I only hope that radio one keep the spirit of his
   show going in some form. Amazing late night listening.
   Ben Hazell, Sheffield

   A great shock, deep condolences to John's family. He will be hugely
   missed.
   Liz, Hampshire

   Devastated, this is so shocking, only the other day I was thinking I
   had not heard one of his shows for a while and was planning on tuning
   back in again to hear that recognisable John Peel voice. Irreplaceable.
   Condolences to the family.
   Craig, Cambridge

   John Peel stayed true to what mattered most in music

   Pete, Nottingham, UK

   The death of John Peel is a tragic loss to the world of music. In an
   age of 'personality' over ability, vacuous corporate hype, talent less
   manufactured rubbish and gimmicks, John Peel stayed true to what
   mattered most in music. RIP mate, you will be sorely missed.
   Pete, Nottingham, UK

   My deepest condolences to John's family. He will be sorely missed. I
   know that, I along with many others, owe John a huge debt for
   introducing us to so many great, new artists over the years and for
   continually championing what is great about music. He will never be
   forgotten.
   John Fisher, Bideford, Devon. UK

   Absolutely, genuinely stunned by this sad, sad news. Music radio, and
   musicians everywhere, owe him a huge debt of gratitude. RIP JP
   Dan, London

   I feel like a bit of my youth has died with him

   Sue, London, UK

   As a music-loving 30-something, I feel like a bit of my youth has died
   with him. His wonderfully matter-of-fact voice will always, to me, be
   synonymous with long, late nights of exam revision in my bedroom. So
   long John.
   Sue, London, UK

   I'm utterly gutted, he will be sorely missed. My sympathies go out to
   all his family and many many friends and listeners.
   Paul, Leeds

   Saturday mornings won't ever be the same. RIP
   Jennifer, UK

   It feels as if a true friend has gone. A great great man.
   Mook, Ipswich

   An unmistakable voice

   Paul Feder, Telford, Salop

   An unmistakable voice, and a remarkable man. He will be much missed by
   his home truths listeners. God Bless.
   Paul Feder, Telford, Salop

   Influenced just about everything I ever listened to as a teenager. A
   very modest, intelligent and passionate man - I feel like a friend has
   died - I will really miss him
   James Cameron, Glasgow, Scotland

   He's the man who broadened my horizons and musical taste, no one could
   replace him. from napalm death to folk music...who else can play such a
   spectrum of wonderful music ? I'll miss you Peelie.
   Philip Thompson, Aberdeen , Scotland

   A genuinely modest man

   Colin MacDonald, UK

   A massive influence on music in the UK and the World, and a genuinely
   modest man.
   Colin MacDonald, UK

   I will dearly miss the best DJ in the world. He showed me the way
   through my childhood to present day in the music world. What will we do
   without him. You will never be forgotten.
   Steven Clarkson, Liverpool, UK

   John Peel was one of the few people in the music business because of a
   genuine love of music. This is a great loss for all music lovers. My
   sympathies go out to his wife and family. Thank you for your
   contribution, John.
   Ellie , Liverpool, UK

   The vast number of bands and musicians who owe him their careers

   Shocked by the passing of such a great man. He has been such a crucial
   part of the music I have listened to since I was a child it almost
   seems inconceivable to listen to the radio without his benign presence.
   Will be sadly missed, not just by the legions of faithful listeners,
   but by the vast number of bands and musicians who owe him their
   careers.
   Richard Coates, Gloucester, UK

   The world has lost a legend of radio broadcasting

   The touchstone of cool for a generation ignored by daytime radio.

   Johnny, Scotland

   Not only is this the end of an era in British culture, but this is a
   saad, sad day for me and so many of my generation who idolised this
   fantastic man. He was a genius, a gentleman and a true inspiration. He
   will be sorely missed.
   Johnny, Scotland

   Absolutely gutted. A legend of music and radio - my thoughts and
   deepest sympathies go out to his family.
   Ross, UK

   A giant of a man, the only true idol I ever had. His loss is immensely
   saddening. RIP Peelie.

   I am truly saddened by this loss. John Peel introduced me to so many
   new genres of music. He will be sadly missed. All my sympathy to his
   family.
   Colin Gray, Dundee, UK

   Let's hope he introduces the oldies upstairs to some proper tunes

   Niki, London, UK

   The man who introduced me to so many of my favourite bands, artists and
   songs. If not for Peel, how many hugely respected an influential
   artists may never have made it big? Deeply saddened, but let's hope he
   introduces the oldies upstairs to some proper tunes.

   Tributes pour in for DJ John Peel

   John Peel
   John Peel suffered a heart attack on holiday in Peru

   Tributes have poured in from the music world after the death of veteran
   broadcaster John Peel, who died on holiday in Peru on Monday aged 65.

   Members of The Smiths, The Undertones, The Manic Street Preachers,
   Radiohead, Blur and Joy Division have spoken about Peel's influence and
   legacy.

   Former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr said the band's early success was
   "largely due to the John Peel show".

   Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid tribute to the BBC Radio 1 DJ.

   Peel, whose radio career spanned 40 years, was on a working holiday in
   the city of Cuzco with his wife Sheila when he suffered a heart attack.

   HAVE YOUR SAY

   Irreplaceable - this man changed the nature of broadcasting

   John, Brighton, UK

   Send us your comments

   He was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving DJ and in recent years had also
   presented Home Truths on Radio 4.

   Radiohead singer Thom Yorke said Peel was his "inspiration" since the
   age of 14. "Who am I going to listen to now? I'm thinking about you.
   Thanks John Peel."

   Blur singer Damon Albarn said the world would be a poorer place without
   Peel.

   "I will miss him deeply," he said. "I want to send my heartfelt
   sympathy to his lovely family. John's memory will never be forgotten
   because he had the spirit of music in him."

   Feargal Sharkey, former frontman of The Undertones, described Peel as
   the "single most important broadcaster we have ever known".

   'He changed my life forever'

   I am pleased and proud to have known him

   Nicky Campbell
   BBC Five Live

   Read Nicky Campbell's full tribute

   The band's single Teenage Kicks was Peel's favourite song and he
   championed the track and the band on his show in the late 1970s.

   Sharkey said: "In the autumn of 1978, something happened that was to
   change my life forever - John Peel played Teenage Kicks on the radio
   for the very first time. Today, it just changed again, forever."

   Johnny Marr, who played with The Smiths on live sessions on Peel's
   show, said he was always the best DJ on the radio.

   "We would try out new songs on the sessions and these often were the
   definitive version," he said.

   Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker said: "In a world that is becoming ever
   more homogenised and pre-programmed, John Peel stuck up for the 'sore
   thumbs' of the music scene and I really can't think of anyone who could
   have done it better or who's going to do it now he's gone."

   Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher called Peel "a rare breed amongst radio
   DJs". The Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield told the BBC
   News website: "It was because of him I got to hear some of the most
   obscure but influential music I ever heard.

   "He was a lifeline to hearing music I would never have heard
   otherwise."

   'Dreadful shock'

   Bernard Sumner of Joy Division and New Order said the news of Peel's
   death was a "dreadful shock".

   "If it wasn't for John Peel, there would be no Joy Division and no New
   Order," he said.

   "He was one of the few people to give bands that played alternative
   music a chance to get heard, and he continued to be a champion of
   cutting-edge music throughout his life."

   He was a unique voice in British broadcasting and used that voice to
   unearth new talent

   Tony Blair

   Kurt Wagner, of US band Lambchop, said Peel was "amazing" and his
   influence was felt far outside his home country.

   Tony Blair's spokesman said the Prime Minister was "genuinely saddened
   by the news".

   He added: "His view is that he was a unique voice in British
   broadcasting and used that voice to unearth new talent and different
   subjects and make them accessible to a much wider audience."

   Peel was born in Heswall, near Liverpool, and joined Radio 1 at the
   launch in 1967.

   He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to punk, reggae and
   hip-hop, before they crossed over into the mainstream.

   'Devastated'

   Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said Peel's death "absolutely
   devastated everyone".

   "We're stunned and bereft. He's irreplaceable because what he had was
   37 years of commitment to young music."

   He was a maverick and he got away with it

   Steve Lamacq
   BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music

   Mr Parfitt told Radio 1's Newsbeat Peel had been on a holiday of a
   lifetime when he died. "He had gone on holiday with his wife Sheila to
   a place where he had always wanted to go."

   Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq said: "He was groundbreaking for me. He just
   broke the rules the whole time. He did things that just weren't done.
   He was a maverick and he got away with it.

   "You have to have trust with a DJ, and everyone built that trust with
   John."

   BBC 6 Music's Liz Kershaw said he was " the least musically snooty
   person we know".

   She said: "He was utterly sincere in what he was doing, not because he
   wanted to be famous but he though he was on a mission to bring stuff to
   people's ears.

   'Great joy'

   "He really did trawl through mailbags of demo cassettes. That's why we
   had Pulp and T-Rex, because he'd been discovering bands like that since
   1967."

   Singer Laura Cantrell, who was championed by Peel in recent months,
   said he had an "unabashed love for music".

   "I really treasure that I got to know the man and his family, to hear
   his stories, and to be welcomed by he and Sheila to Peel Acres.

   "To experience his sense of humour, the great joy that he took in his
   life was inspiring."

   Kerry rally rocks to Springsteen

   Bruce Springsteen and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry at a
   Kerry rally
   Springsteen drew about 80,000 people to the Kerry rally

   Rock star Bruce Springsteen has turned out to back presidential
   candidate John Kerry, performing at rallies in the final stages of his
   election campaign.

   Springsteen appeared to roars from the crowd in Madison, Wisconsin and
   Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday.

   He is also due to appear on Monday in Cleveland, Ohio, the night before
   polling begins.

   Mr Kerry has also secured the support of Jon Bon Jovi, who has already
   performed at one Democrat rallies.

   Springsteen has never before endorsed a political candidate, but he
   attracted about 80,000 people to the rally in Madison and tens of
   thousands in Columbus.

   He sung an acoustic version of "No Surrender", which is Mr Kerry's
   campaign theme song, before hugging the Democrat candidate on stage.

   "When George Bush heard that the Boss was playing with me... he thought
   they meant Dick Cheney," Mr Kerry quipped, in reference to the vice
   president's perceived influence over Mr Bush.

   Attack on Bush

   Springsteen has just completed the Vote for Change tour, alongside
   artists including REM, Pearl Jam and the Dixie Chicks.

   They performed in 36 cities over two weeks, pushing their message of
   voting out President George W Bush.

   Springsteen recently told Rolling Stone magazine that Mr Bush had been
   "fundamentally dishonest" in launching war on Iraq.

   Proceeds from the tour were donated to America Coming Together (ACT),
   an organisation which aims to motivate voters against the incumbent
   president.

   The tour took in crucial swing states such as Ohio and Florida,
   critical areas for both parties.

   Actor and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will lend his star
   power to the Bush campaign as it enters its final days.

   Obesity sparks diabetes fears
   Ania Lichtarowicz
   BBC health reporter

   Obese
   Being overweight has health risks, scientists say

   Soaring childhood obesity rates will increase diabetes rates affecting
   economic development across the globe, international agencies are
   warning.

   The caution from the WHO and the International Diabetes Federation
   comes on World Diabetes Day.

   They say with an estimated 10% of school-aged children overweight or
   obese the situation is getting worse.

   More than 22 million children under five years old are obese or
   overweight, not only from affluent countries.

   Over 17 million of them are in the developing world.

   Each one of these children is at a much higher risk of developing type
   2 diabetes.

   This used to be known as adult onset diabetes as it would be diagnosed
   late in life, but because of poor diet and little physical activity the
   disease is now being seen more often in teenagers.

   There are also other risks associated with being overweight - heart
   disease, stroke, cancer and there's some data to suggest that
   conditions like Alzheimer's might also be linked.

   But the obesity epidemic can be reversed.

   Just small changes can make real difference - banning fizzy drinks in
   schools, increasing sport classes and teaching basic nutrition from an
   early age can prevent weight gain, therefore reducing the chances of
   diabetes developing.

   Guilty verdict for Congolese star

   Papa Wemba
   Papa Wemba's supporters cheered as he left court

   A court in Paris has handed down a 30-month jail term - most of it
   suspended - to one of Africa's biggest music stars, Congolese singer
   Papa Wemba.

   He has already spent nearly four months in jail, so he will not have to
   return to prison, the Bobigny court decided.

   The so-called king of "rumba rock," arrested in France last year, was
   found guilty of aiding an illegal immigration racket involving his
   entourage.

   Prosecutors said almost 200 Congolese nationals entered France
   illegally.

   The BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Paris says 150 of his fans -- in and
   outside the court -- shouted and danced with joy when they heard the
   verdict, before rushing to carry their hero out of court, a free man.

   Papa Wemba is suspected of having received payment to procure visas for
   the Congolese nationals.

   He's not here to take the blame for a whole group of people

   Yves Leberquier
   Papa Wemba's lawyer

   Profile: Papa Wemba

   A prosecutor had called for a five-year jail sentence for the singer.

   Papa Wemba, 55, faces similar charges in Belgium, where he holds
   citizenship.

   French prosecutor Nadine Perrin called for jail sentences ranging from
   between 18 months and four years for eight others appearing on the same
   charges, including the singer's wife.

   The singer, whose real name is Jules Shungu Wembadio Pene Kikumba, was
   arrested in Paris in February last year.

   He admitted helping a small number of people enter Europe, but only
   after his name was used for the scheme by others.

   Alleged scam

   According to the French authorities, would-be immigrants from DR Congo
   paid $4,500 in exchange for documents showing that they were members of
   Papa Wemba's band or road crew.

   French officials finally became suspicious when some 200 people showed
   up at immigration in 2000, claiming to be Papa Wemba's musicians, yet
   none had any musical instruments with them.

   French police say some turned out to be goat herders and others
   fishermen.

   Papa Wemba was already a hugely popular performer in the then Zaire
   before the fashion for African and world music brought him fame in
   Europe and the US.

   He is also renowned as the moving spirit behind a cult movement known
   as "the Sapeurs" whose members, young men, spend huge amounts of money
   on designer clothes.

   'Cool' Doherty angers drug group

   Pete Doherty
   Doherty left The Libertines following high-profile drug problems

   A drugs charity has accused magazine NME of behaving irresponsibly by
   naming singer Pete Doherty, who has battled drug addiction, its Cool
   Icon of 2004.

   The NME says Doherty, who sang in rock band The Libertines, and
   ex-bandmate Carl Barat embody "the notion of cool".

   Drugs charity Addaction feared this would influence readers, saying:
   "Young people are vulnerable to hard drugs."

   But the magazine's assistant editor Malik Meer said it was Doherty's
   talent which earned him the title.

   Jail sentence

   The Libertines topped the UK chart in September with their second,
   self-titled, album on which Doherty played.

   On the week of its release Doherty received a suspended four month jail
   sentence after admitting possession of a flick knife.

   In 2003 he served two months in jail after being found guilty of
   burglary at ex-bandmate Carl Barat's home. Doherty now has his own
   band, Babyshambles.

   Not everyone has the ability to fall back on expensive rehabilitation
   programmes like rock stars

   Rebecca Cheshire, Addaction

   Addaction said the consumption of crack cocaine and heroin is rising
   among young people, fuelled by cheap street prices.

   "The record industry does have a responsibility to promote healthy
   lifestyles," policy manager Rebecca Cheshire told The Times newspaper.

   "Not everyone has the ability to fall back on expensive rehabilitation
   programmes like rock stars."

   But the NME's Malik Meer was not convinced that fans of Doherty would
   be inspired to take drugs.

   "It has not been proved that rock stars who take drugs or embark upon
   antisocial behaviour influence their fans to do the same," he said.

   "We are rewarding Pete Doherty's creativity and skill, not the fact
   that he has taken drugs. He writes great music and is a great rock 'n'
   roll star."

   Meer said The Streets' Mike Skinner, ranked in second place in the NME
   Cool List, is also respected for his music rather than the drug-taking
   he details in his songs.

   "While this list was compiled by staff, we are confident that it
   reflects the taste of our readers."

   A clash of football philosophies
   By John May

   Harry Redknapp and Milan Mandaric

   Mandaric and Redknapp call truce

   Portsmouth Football Club continues to be a soap opera based upon an
   Aesop fable.

   Before chairman Milan Mandaric and Harry Redknapp kissed and made up
   after their break up, they had played out a kicking and biting drama
   over a footballing moral tale.

   It was the Ant and Grasshopper played out on the big screen as they
   wrested for moral control of a football club.

   On the one hand, there is Mandaric: the sensible, prudent ant, striving
   to ensure something was put by for a rainy day.

   Then there was Redknapp the grasshopper, with his live-for-today
   attitude.

   At heart was a philosophical rift over how to run a football club.

   In his 32 month reign as manager Redknapp presided over a total of 144
   player transactions: 36 permanent transfers in, 49 permanent transfers
   out, 15 loan players brought in, and 44 loaned out.

   His gross of transactions works out at roughly one per week.

   conference
   Mandaric and Redknapp try to patch up their differences

   Without doubt, Redknapp's policy paid off for Pompey especially in
   getting them out of the Football League.

   In the aftermath of ITV Digital's collapse, Redknapp sniffed the air
   like an African Hunting Dog, scenting a one-off opportunity to get
   Pompey up by splashing the chairman's cash in a season when no other
   clubs could operate in the transfer market.

   Redknapp went out and conjured up a whole new team, built around
   veterans like Paul Merson and Gianluca Festa, out of whom he could coax
   a few last tunes.

   Having romped to the Championship, Redknapp licked his lips at the
   prospect of dismantling one purpose-built team and replacing it with
   another designed to stay in the Premiership.

   In came the likes of Sheringham, Berger and Smertin and again the ends
   justified the means as Pompey comfortably stayed up.

   But while it is hard to criticise Redknapp's results on the pitch,
   Mandaric disliked the short-termism of his kit-form team methods built
   around the swansongs of veterans.

   Mandaric was looking for something more long-term, more value for his
   money.

   REDKNAPP'S GROSS OF DEALS

   Permanent deals in: 36
   Permanent deal out: 49
   Loan players in: 15
   Loan players out: 44

   Mandaric's statement

   Since buying a club languishing dangerously in adminstration, Mandaric
   has ploughed around £30m of his fortune into Pompey and while it has
   Premiership status, nothing else about Portsmouth FC says 'top flight
   club.'

   Mandaric is keen to change a ramshackle infrastructure which has an
   outdated stadium (a key weapon, though, as other Premiership teams hate
   playing there), trains at Southampton University and has no long-term
   programme for developing its own players.

   Whisper it, but Mandaric has cast eyes up the M27 where Southampton
   have a new stadium, well-appointed training set-up, its own mini media
   empire, and most importantly in his eyes, an academy which is starting
   to produce players for the first team.

   But this is where the pair sat at philosophical odds.

   Redknapp's view is that is that all resources should be spent on the
   first-team, any diversion of funds elsewhere as simply a waste.

   Paul Merson in his Portsmouth days
   Signing Merson was a Redknapp master-stroke

   Privately, Redknapp begrudged every penny of the close on £2m spent on
   the land acquisition, legal fees and lengthy planning process that
   provides Pompey with the means to develop Fratton Park and the
   surrounding Pompey Village.

   There have even been informal talks and a tentative offer of help from
   Southampton to help set up an academy.

   Slowly, but surely, Mandaric won the tiny battles with Redknapp, and
   eventually the war when he brought in Velimir Zajec as director of
   football.

   Just as crucially, while supporters revelled in the excitement of
   Redknapp's quick turnover of players, they were starting to subscribe
   to Mandaric's view.

   However it pans out, the Ant has triumphed over the Grasshopper. But
   there are still plenty of legs left in this story.

   West End theatres need millions

   London's West End
   West End theatres raise £1.5b each year for the economy

   Up to £125m of public money will be needed to bring London's 40 West
   End theatres up to standard.

   The theatres need £250m to fund a major refurbishment programme to
   bring them into line for the 21st Century.

   Half of the money needed over the next 15 years would come from the
   theatres themselves but the rest may have to come from the public
   purse.

   The Heritage Lottery Fund, the London Development Agency and local
   councils are being contacted to help.

   The amount needed to upgrade the theatres was identified in a report
   written by The Theatres Trust, a national body which aims to protect
   theatres.

   It's public money and we have to spend it wisely

   Heritage Lottery Fund

   A spokesman from The Department of Culture said it was acting on behalf
   of the theatres to help raise half of the money.

   "An issue that needs to be taken into consideration is that 37 out of
   the 40 theatres are listed buildings which makes it more costly to
   improve, but it's not impossible," he said.

   "The government's view is that West End Theatres are very important for
   the city's economy raising £1.5b each year."

   But he said it had to be recognised that the theatres were commercial
   ventures for which the government did not normally provide funding.

   "All we can do is approach organisations on their behalf to help
   provide funding," he said.

   A spokeswoman from Heritage Lottery Fund said: "Commercially owned
   theatres are a low priority for funding from Heritage Lottery Fund as
   are all privately-owned heritage attractions.

   "It's public money and we have to spend it wisely."

   Actress Tyler gives birth to boy

   Liv Tyler
   Liv Tyler appeared in the Lord of the Rings trilogy

   Hollywood actress Liv Tyler has given birth to a baby boy.

   The 27-year-old, who is the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler
   and model Bebe Buell, gave birth in New York on Tuesday.

   "They are both doing great", said the actress's publicist Stephen
   Huvane, who added the child has yet to be named.

   Tyler, who starred in the Lord of the Rings films, is married to
   Royston Langdon from the band Spacehog. The pair tied the knot in March
   2003.

   The actress played the elf Arwen in all three episodes of The Lord of
   the Rings trilogy.

   Her performance - along with the ensemble cast of the film's third and
   final outing - won a series of awards earlier this year.

   She has also appeared in films such as Armageddon, Inventing the
   Abbotts and That Thing You Do.

Is there anyone who can make a proper barm cake?

   / Sport
   Share
   [BUTTON] [BUTTON] [BUTTON] [BUTTON]

   IS there anybody left in your part of Lancashire, who knows how to make
   a proper barm cake?

   I get fobbed off with bread cakes here in Yorkshire, and it's the same
   story when I visit relatives in Atherton. Bread cakes are a very poor
   imitation of a proper barm cake, and cannot be compared.

   All the small family bakeries who made them seem to have closed down,
   and in spite of numerous inquiries I have been unable to find the
   recipe.

   When I was a tea lad at the Lancashire Power Company's depot, Hill Top,
   Walkden, in 1940, collecting orders for dinner, BBC's -- buttered barm
   cakes -- were always top of the list.

   It would be a great shame if the recipe for this Lancashire delicacy
   and former staple food of the working man was allowed to disappear.

Film Score Composer Elmer Bernstein Dies

   By Adam Bernstein
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, August 20, 2004; Page B06

   Composer Elmer Bernstein, 82, who died of undisclosed causes Aug. 18 at
   his home in Ojai, Calif., wrote music for more than 200 movies. He was
   responsible for the gritty trumpet-and-drums jazz score to "The Man
   With the Golden Arm" (1955), one of the first to use pop music
   orchestrations -- a development he grew to loathe as the music became
   chiefly a commercial ploy.

   The family said Mr. Bernstein had had a long illness but would not
   release the cause of death.
   Elmer Bernstein won an Oscar for his score for the 1967 film
   "Thoroughly Modern Millie." Over his more than 50-year career, he
   received 14 Academy Award nominations. (Reuters)

   Mr. Bernstein wrote the instantly recognizable theme to "The
   Magnificent Seven" (1960) -- a folksy-symphonic piece later used in
   Marlboro cigarette advertisements and excerpted as recently as Michael
   Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" -- and the sensitive piano and flute
   accompaniment to "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962).

   He received 14 Academy Award nominations and won once, for his original
   score for "Thoroughly Modern Millie" (1967), generally regarded as one
   of his less distinguished works.

   During a five-decade career, Mr. Bernstein was a preeminent figure in
   film composition. He created a jaunty march for "The Great Escape"
   (1963). He scored many of John Wayne's last films, including "True
   Grit" (1969) and "The Shootist" (1976).

   Starting in the late 1970s, he seemed to be the official composer for
   "Saturday Night Live" refugees who starred in such loopy hits as
   "Animal House," "Trading Places," "Ghostbusters" and "The Three
   Amigos!"

   He originally had been recruited to "Animal House" by one of his son's
   friends, director John Landis. Landis asked the composer to score the
   bawdy college comedy "as if it was a serious narrative."

   Mr. Bernstein worked on his share of dubious projects, including Bill
   Cosby's "Leonard Part 6" (1987). By the late 1980s, after so many
   comedy features, he was no longer associated with dramatic scoring. He
   lobbied for a new chance, winning work on such acclaimed projects as
   "My Left Foot" (1989), "The Grifters" (1990), "The Age of Innocence"
   (1993) and "Far From Heaven" (2002). The last, which yielded his final
   Oscar nomination, was a tribute to the string-laden 1950s film scores
   against which he initially rebelled.

   Over the years, he found less to like about modern composition. He
   grumbled about quality work being submerged for the sake of churning
   out pop songs to promote a film.

   "In the area of pop music, everybody thinks they know what to do, and
   they may be right," he told The Washington Post in 1979. "I probably
   don't know any more about pop music than the kid on the street. This
   can be very disturbing, because the only secure thing an artist has to
   fall back on is his judgment. And the one great freedom you have to
   cherish as an artist is the freedom to make your own mistakes -- not
   other people's mistakes."

   Elmer Bernstein, no relation to conductor and composer Leonard
   Bernstein, was born in New York on April 4, 1922. His parents were
   Ukrainian immigrants who encouraged their son's interest in the arts.

   By age 13, his advanced piano skills led him to composer Aaron Copland,
   who advised the young man to study composition with Israel Citkowitz
   and other leading figures.

   After attending New York University, he served in the Armed Forces
   Radio Service during World War II and did arranging for Glenn Miller's
   Army Air Forces big band.

   In 1949, his score for a U.N. radio show commemorating the founding of
   the state of Israel wowed an executive at Columbia Pictures, who
   invited Mr. Bernstein to Hollywood.

   He began by scoring the football drama "Saturday's Hero" (1951) and
   other middling fare. The end of the studio system and the
   anti-communist purge of the industry seemed to work against Mr.
   Bernstein, who had written music reviews for the Communist Daily Worker
   but was not a party member. By 1953, he was resorting to writing music
   for "Cat-Women of the Moon" (1953).

   His career might have floundered if not for an introduction to Cecil B.
   DeMille, the arch-conservative director then preparing "The Ten
   Commandments" (1956), the biblical epic starring Charlton Heston as
   Moses. Satisfied with Mr. Bernstein's political stripes, DeMille hired
   him initially to provide music for dance sequences but later chose him
   to replace ailing composer Victor Young.

   Mr. Bernstein's resulting music, both bombastic and reverential, led
   him to large-scale westerns and action films that defined much of his
   work in the 1960s.

   While working with DeMille, he was hired by Otto Preminger for "The Man
   With the Golden Arm," about a jazz drummer addicted to heroin. Mr.
   Bernstein, to create one of the first all-jazz film scores, hired a
   band that included trumpeter Shorty Rogers and drummer Shelly Manne.
   The commercial release of the music also was successful, bringing the
   composer to the forefront of his trade.

   "Until now jazz has been used as a specialty or a culmination of a plot
   point," Hollywood Reporter critic Jack Moffitt wrote at the time. "It
   remained for Bernstein to prove that it can be used as a sustained and
   continuous story-telling element in underscoring the mood elements of
   an entire picture."

   His score for "To Kill a Mockingbird" was vastly different, using the
   theme sparingly as opposed to the lush orchestrations that had
   dominated the screen since the 1930s.

   Mr. Bernstein wanted to complement the film's child's-eye view of adult
   dilemmas. "That led me to the basic sound of the score: the piano being
   played one note at a time, something kids do all the time," he told the
   Los Angeles Times. "Music-box-type sounds, bells, harps, single-note
   flutes were all things that suggested a child's world."

   He was twice nominated for a Tony Award and won the 1964 Emmy Award for
   his original music for "The Making of the President: 1960," which aired
   on ABC.

   He owned a recording company that released film scores from his heroes,
   including Miklos Rozsa and Bernard Herrmann.

   Pot-bellied, with a mop of shaggy gray hair, Mr. Bernstein worked much
   of his career in a filthy West Los Angeles apartment.

   "Music is a romantic art, yes," the composer said. "It's an art of
   shades and sounds, and it's an emotional art. It deals with feelings
   rather than intellect. But the making of it is an intellectual
   exercise. And therefore it can be done in any surroundings."

   His marriage to Pearl Glusman Bernstein ended in divorce.

   Survivors include his wife, Eve Adamson Bernstein; two sons from his
   first marriage; and two daughters from his second marriage.

   Palestinian leaders postpone visit to Arafat in Paris [typk.jpg]

   Alliot-Marie announced Monday at French Europe 1 radio that Palestinian
    leaders have canceled their visit to ailing Palestinian leader Yasser
   Arafat in Paris. Acting Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader
      Mahmud Abbas, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and Foreign
     Minister Nabil Shaath will defer their visit to their ailing leader
                          Yassar Arafat in France.

    Suha insisted that her husband was on the road to recovery and would
   return home but "Abbas, Qureiand Shaath, who are trying to inherit his
     power, want to bury Arafat alive." Suha is one of only a handful of
     people who have been authorized to see the 75-year-old Palestinian
                         leader in the last 10 days.

       PARIS, Nov. 8 (Xinhuanet) -- Acting Palestine Liberation
   Organization (PLO) leader Mahmud Abbas, Palestinian Prime Minister
   Ahmed Qurei and Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath will defer their visit to
   their ailing leader Yassar Arafat in France, French RFI television
   reported Monday.

       The cancellation came after Arafat's wife Suha Arafat comments in
   an interview with the Doha-based Al Jazeera television. Suha said "Abu
   Ammar (Arafat) is doing well and will return home," but "Abbas, Qurei
   and Shaath, who are trying to inherit his power, want to bury Arafat
   alive."

       She also made an appeal to the Palestinian people. "A handful of
   (people) seeking to inherit power are coming to Paris to try and bury
   Abu Ammar alive. I ask you to look at the extent of the plot," she
   said.

       Suha is one of only a handful of people who have been authorized to
   see the 75-year-old Palestinian leader in the last 10 days.

       Abbas, alias Abu Mazen, Qurei, and Shaath were due in Paris Monday,
   French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced Sunday inParis.

       Qurei and Abbas were making the trip as they were frustrated atthe
   lack of information on the state of Arafat's health, RFI reported.

       Arafat was admitted in Percy hospital in southwestern Paris suburb
   of Clamart on Oct. 29 to diagnose his reported "blood disorder."

   Indian troops are on alert in Srinagar, India-controlled Kashmir, Nov.
          16, 2004. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will visit
      India-controlled Kashimir on Wednesday, when India will begin to
                withdraw part of its troops from the region.

   ¡¡  BEIJING, Nov. 17 (Xinhuanet) -- Two militants holed-up in a
   commercial complex in Kashmir have been killed in heavy exchange of
   fire with security forces.
       The two were killed, as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
   arrived on his maiden visit to Srinagar, the capital of
   Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday.

       A civilian was also killed in the operation that lasted for four
   hours to flush out the militants hiding in the complex, about 200
   meters away from the stadium where the prime minister is scheduled to
   address a public meeting.

       Local officials say the prime minister's rally has been postponed
   by nearly two hours due to the development.

       SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 22 (Xinhuanet) -- The death toll in the five
   iron mines that caught fire Saturday morning in Shahe City in north
   China's Hebei Province has risen to 57, said an official with the
   leading group in charge of the rescue operation.

       The bodies of 49 miners killed in the fire, most of whom succumbed
   to suffocation, were lifted to the ground by 7:30 a.m. Monday, and the
   location of eight other dead miners has been identified and will be
   transported to the surface soon.

       Miners killed in the disaster were either locals or from the
   underdeveloped Guizhou Province in southwest China and Shaanxi Province
   in northwest China.

       Preliminary investigation shows that the fire broke out due to
   electronic cable self-ignition in one iron mine. The fire spread
   quickly to four other iron mines which were all connected. Heavy smog
   soon trapped 106 miners.

       Up to now, 46 miners have been rescued alive. But three other
   miners remained missing. Search for the missing miners is sill going
   on. Enditem

   are."

       The attack took place at 9:00 a.m. (0600 GMT), when a suicide
   bomber drove his explosive-laden vehicle to the entrance manned by
   Iraqi National Guards and blew up his car as he was waiting to be
   searched, an Iraqi security said.

       A US military spokeswoman told reporters that no one from the
   US-led forces was wounded or killed in the attack. The Green Zone,
   housing Iraq's interim government offices and US and British embassies,
   has come under frequent attacks by insurgents bent on undermining the
   US-back Iraqi interim government. Enditem

                  Expectant England seek hat-trick of wins
                                 (Agencies)

     England should complete a hat-trick of victories that will put them
   firmly on course for the 2006 World Cup in the qualifier in Azerbaijan.

   England started their Group Six campaign with a disappointing 2-2 draw
   in Austria, after leading 2-0 in the second half, a result that sparked
   calls from a hostile media for coach Sven-Goran Eriksson to be sacked.

    The critics were silenced, though, by a gritty 2-1 victory in Poland
   and a comfortable 2-0 win over Wales on Saturday which left Eriksson's
     men top of the group with seven points, ahead of Poland (6pts) and
                               Austria (4pts).

    Against an Azerbaijan side with only two points on the board England
    should have little difficulty defending that lead -- and potentially
     extending it if Poland fail to beat the Welsh in Cardiff -- despite
                              some injury woes.

    Skipper David Beckham, who is also suspended, and Steven Gerrard are
   two heavyweight absentees from the midfield, with Shaun-Wright Phillips
   expected to replace the former and Nicky Butt the latter after his fine
                           display against Wales.

             Zone, Group Six qualifier on October 13. [Reuters]
     Frank Lampard, who opened the scoring on Saturday, is sure to start
      while the remaining left-sided slot in a 4-4-2 midfield should be
     between Joe Cole and Owen Hargreaves, depending on whether Eriksson
                  wants an attack or defence-minded player.

       Teenage striker Wayne Rooney, who made some thrilling runs from
   midfield in a playmaking role on Saturday, should partner Michael Owen
                                  up front.

     However, Eriksson may yet stick by Saturday's three-man attack with
   Owen and Jermain Defoe supported by Rooney. Hargreaves would then come
                        in for Beckham on the right.

                                ROONEY THREAT

    A revelation at Euro 2004, Rooney is one of the hottest properties in
      international football and the 18-year-old can expect some tight
                              marking in Baku.

   Azerbaijan coach Carlos Alberto was quoted as telling media this week:
    "Rooney is an excellent player. He will be our big problem and we may
                need two or three players to look after him."

   The Brazilian, who has no major injury or suspension worries following
    a 0-0 home draw with Northern Ireland on Saturday, is likely to keep
                         the same starting line-up.

   It remains to be seen whether the small country on the Caspian Sea can
     pose trouble for England on the pitch, although they are likely to
   cause problems for the British media with two players named Guliyev and
                        three Gurbanovs in the squad.

     Defenders Kamal Guliyev and Emin Guliyev formed the Azeri backline
     against the Northern Irish after being recalled following a lengthy
                                  absence.

       Midfielder Makhmud Gurbanov also started Saturday's game, while
   strikers Ildar Gurbanov and Gurban Gurbanov came on in the second half.
                    None of the five players are related.

                         Wednesday's probable teams:

     Azerbaijan: Jahangir Hasanzade; Rafael Amirbekov, Aftandil Hajiyev,
    Emin Guliyev, Kamal Guliyev; Mahir Shukurov, Makhmud Gurbanov, Ismail
            Mamedov, Rashad Sadygov; Samir Aliyev, Nadir Nabiyev.

     England: Paul Robinson; Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand,
     Ashley Cole; Shaun Wright-Phillips, Frank Lampard, Nicky Butt, Owen
                   Hargreaves; Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen

                      Referee: Alain Hamer (Luxembourg)

                  Bush, Kerry take campaigns to key states
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-27 16:31

     Sen. John Kerry says the United States is "in a bigger mess by the
    day," citing the murky fate of missing explosives in Iraq to sharpen
   the indictment of his opponent. President Bush has put together an end
   game that includes persistent appeals for Democratic votes and a rarely
        used weapon in this bruising campaign a positive commercial.

       In the mail, on the phone and in courtrooms across the nation,
   activists, lawyers and partisans of all kinds intensified their efforts
                            to shape the outcome.

         River Center, Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2004 in Dubuque, Iowa. [AP]
    With their agendas laid out, Bush and Kerry are going for spirit over
   substance in the final days, trying to create an aura of excitement in
     get-out-the-vote rallies and snag the dwindling pool of voters who
                            haven't taken sides.

     Rockers Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi were rejoining the Kerry
   campaign, minstrels in his fast-moving gallery. California Gov. Arnold
    Schwarzenegger is bringing his star power and moderate GOP reputation
                      to Bush's side later in the week.

   Bush turned to the iconoclastic Democratic Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia
   to introduce him Wednesday at Pennsylvania and Ohio events, in keeping
    with his late-breaking appeals to Democrats who aren't sold on their
                            own party's nominee.

        The president has been talking up the "great tradition of the
    Democratic Party," citing the steeliness in crises shown by the likes
   of Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, to make the point Kerry doesn't
                                 measure up.

    Kerry mentioned those presidents and more, saying great U.S. leaders
    built alliances that protected this country while Bush "has failed in
     his fundamental obligation as commander in chief to make America as
                      safe and secure as we should be."

   The Democrat was focusing on economic troubles of the middle class in a
    Sioux City speech Wednesday before stumping in Minnesota and back in
     Iowa, at a Cedar Rapids event. Aides saw that speech and one Friday
   that will blend his campaign's economic and foreign policy proposals as
                     his "closing arguments" for change.

   After ripping Kerry for weeks as an equivocator, Bush planned to close
     the contest with a 60-second commercial meant to show he's steady,
           trustworthy and compassionate in these dangerous times.

    Aides said the ad includes footage of an emotional president telling
   the Republican National Convention about meeting the children of slain
                               U.S. soldiers.

    Still, neither campaign was going upbeat, nor were their supporters.

   Hard-hitting leaflets lined mailboxes in a dozen or so hotly contested
   states. A glossy mailing by the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee
    showed burning roadside wreckage in Iraq, with U.S. soldiers looking
            on, and the headline "Wrong Choices ... Less Secure."

    A Republican National Committee mailing showed pictures of Jane Fonda
     and Michael Moore, two anti-war liberals supporting Kerry, and the
             headline, "John Kerry's heart and soul of America?"

   Kerry's latest ad accuses the Bush administration of failing to secure
       nearly 400 tons of explosives that disappeared from a military
   installation south of Baghdad around the time U.S. forces were toppling
      Saddam Hussein's government, and he pressed the point at rallies
                                  Tuesday.

    He said in Green Bay, Wis., the explosives "could be in the hands of
            terrorists, used to attack our troops or our people."

      Going beyond the known facts, he said later in Las Vegas that the
           explosives have actually been used against U.S. troops.

    "We're in a bigger mess by the day and this president can't see it or
     can't admit it, but either way, America is less safe," Kerry said.

     Vice President Dick Cheney, campaigning in Florida, called Kerry an
   "armchair general." "If our troops had not gone into Iraq as John Kerry
   apparently thinks they should not have, that is 400,000 tons of weapons
   and explosives that would be in the hands of Saddam Hussein, who would
          still be sitting in his palace instead of jail," he said.

   New state polls suggested the race was deadlocked in Florida, Ohio and
    Pennsylvania, the three most important battlegrounds in the race for
    270 Electoral College votes. A Los Angeles Times survey joined a pile
     pointing to a national dead heat. Bush and Kerry were 48-48 in that
                                    poll.

    With the possibility of another inconclusive election night looming,
    lawyers were already deep in courtroom entanglements in a variety of
      states over problems either anticipated or already experienced in
                       states with heavy early voting.

     In one example, a federal judge in Miami ruled against Democrats in
      saying Florida election officials will not be required to process
                    incomplete voter registration forms.

                   Arafat takes turn for worse, aides say
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-11-04 08:48

   Yasser Arafat's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past
    day, and doctors treating him at a Paris hospital remain unsure what
    has caused the 75-year-old Palestinian leader's illness, Palestinian
                       officials said early Thursday.

   The Palestinian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
    an Israeli TV report that Arafat was in very serious condition. They
   said details would be disclosed at a previously planned news conference
                   scheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. EST.

    Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's health has suffered a setback and
   doctors treating him in France are carrying out more tests to discover
     why, Palestinian envoy Leila Shahid told Reuters November 3, 2004.

       Arafat, who has been ill for three weeks, was flown to a French
   military hospital on Friday after passing out briefly at his West Bank
                                headquarters.

    Mohammed Dahlan, a former Palestinian security chief in Paris with a
     group of Arafat aides, denied, however, that Arafat's condition has
     worsened. "The president's condition is stable," he told reporters.

      Arafat initially was said to have been suffering a severe case of
   influenza, but later was diagnosed with having blood abnormalities and
    trouble with his digestion. Palestinian officials insist leukemia has
      been ruled out, but say doctors remain uncertain what is causing
                              Arafat's illness.

   In Israel Channel Two television said the Palestinian leader was moved
      to an intensive care unit at the French military hospital outside
                                   Paris.

     Earlier, the Palestinian envoy to France, Leila Shahid, said Arafat
    felt well enough to ask about the U.S. presidential election. An aide
   later issued a statement in Arafat's name congratulating President Bush
                             on his re-election.

        Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said Israel is closely
      monitoring the health of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and is
                  preparing for the "day after" his death.

    "We are tracking his condition very carefully," he told Israel Radio.
      "Our goal is to prepare for the day after, if and when he dies."

     Israeli intelligence was widely criticized after it was caught off
    guard last week when Arafat's health suddenly deteriorated and he was
                        flown to Paris for treatment.

    Although no details are known about Arafat's ailment, Shalom said his
   condition "is very serious." At the same time, he said, "it is too soon
    to eulogize Yasser Arafat," and Israel expected the picture to become
                          clearer within the week.

        Israel believes Arafat may have cancer, or possibly a serious
   infection, he said. "We are preparing for every eventuality," he said.

   Initial blood tests performed while Arafat was still in Ramallah in the
               West Bank revealed a low blood platelet count.

      Platelets are blood components that aid clotting. Physicians gave
   Arafat a platelet transfusion shortly after he was urgently transported
   from his battered Ramallah headquarters to the Percy military hospital
                        southwest of Paris on Friday.

                   Arafat takes turn for worse, aides say

   Yasser Arafat's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past
    day, and doctors treating him at a Paris hospital remain unsure what
    has caused the 75-year-old Palestinian leader's illness, Palestinian
                       officials said early Thursday.

   The Palestinian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
    an Israeli TV report that Arafat was in very serious condition. They
   said details would be disclosed at a previously planned news conference
                   scheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. EST.

    Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's health has suffered a setback and
   doctors treating him in France are carrying out more tests to discover
     why, Palestinian envoy Leila Shahid told Reuters November 3, 2004.

       Arafat, who has been ill for three weeks, was flown to a French
   military hospital on Friday after passing out briefly at his West Bank
                                headquarters.

    Mohammed Dahlan, a former Palestinian security chief in Paris with a
     group of Arafat aides, denied, however, that Arafat's condition has
     worsened. "The president's condition is stable," he told reporters.

      Arafat initially was said to have been suffering a severe case of
   influenza, but later was diagnosed with having blood abnormalities and
    trouble with his digestion. Palestinian officials insist leukemia has
      been ruled out, but say doctors remain uncertain what is causing
                              Arafat's illness.

   In Israel Channel Two television said the Palestinian leader was moved
      to an intensive care unit at the French military hospital outside
                                   Paris.

     Earlier, the Palestinian envoy to France, Leila Shahid, said Arafat
    felt well enough to ask about the U.S. presidential election. An aide
   later issued a statement in Arafat's name congratulating President Bush
                             on his re-election.

        Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said Israel is closely
      monitoring the health of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and is
                  preparing for the "day after" his death.

    "We are tracking his condition very carefully," he told Israel Radio.
      "Our goal is to prepare for the day after, if and when he dies."

     Israeli intelligence was widely criticized after it was caught off
    guard last week when Arafat's health suddenly deteriorated and he was
                        flown to Paris for treatment.

    Although no details are known about Arafat's ailment, Shalom said his
   condition "is very serious." At the same time, he said, "it is too soon
    to eulogize Yasser Arafat," and Israel expected the picture to become
                          clearer within the week.

        Israel believes Arafat may have cancer, or possibly a serious
   infection, he said. "We are preparing for every eventuality," he said.

   Initial blood tests performed while Arafat was still in Ramallah in the
               West Bank revealed a low blood platelet count.

      Platelets are blood components that aid clotting. Physicians gave
   Arafat a platelet transfusion shortly after he was urgently transported
   from his battered Ramallah headquarters to the Percy military hospital
                        southwest of Paris on Friday.

                    World leaders mourn Arafat at funeral

    Presidents and kings mourned Yasser Arafat on Friday, with his wooden
      coffin draped in the Palestinian flag and borne on a horse-drawn
   guncarriage a state funeral for a leader who symbolized the aspirations
                       of Palestinians for statehood.

    After humble prayers in a mosque, a military band in scarlet played a
    funeral dirge and a high-stepping honor guard carried wreaths at the
                  head of an almost-triumphant procession.

    Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah as well
    as Farouk Kaddoumi, the newly chosen head of the Fatah organization,
     and Mahmoud Abbas, head of the PLO executive committee, were among
   those in the front row of about 60 world leaders and other dignitaries
    trailing the casket down Salah Salem Street, which was closed to the
                                   public.

   The service, amid high-security at the Galaa Club, a military compound
   in northern Cairo, was aired live on Egyptian television, although all
   other media was barred from the mosque and tent where most dignitaries
                          sat through the prayers.

    "He has served his people all his life, until he faced his God, with
     courage and honesty. Let us pray for his soul," the Grand Sheik of
       Al-Azhar Mohammed Sayed Tantawi told the gathered dignitaries.
   Throughout the ceremony Egyptian television played Quranic recitations,
                 including a verse: "After hardship, ease."

   Arafat's widow, Suha, watched with their daughter, and both wept as the
                    coffin was lifted from the carriage.

     After the funeral, Arafat's coffin was expected to be taken to the
     Almaza military base just behind the club. From there, it was to be
    flown to el-Arish, in Egypt's northeastern Sinai Peninsula, according
        to Palestinian coordinator Hani Jebour. He said two Jordanian
   helicopters would then ferry the coffin and its accompanying delegation
   to Arafat's Ramallah compound, where he was kept a virtual prisoner in
                 his final years, for burial before sunset.

   Arafat, who died Thursday in Paris, was mourned by Palestinians at home
    and in refugee camps across the region who had hoped he would one day
      lead them back to Jerusalem, and by Arabs who had seen him as an
    inspiring leader. Arab and Israeli authorities took steps to prevent
    any emotional outpouring from evolving into riots, and many countries
         declared official mourning periods for Palestinian leader.

    Harried preparations for Arafat's grave were made in Ramallah. Early
   Friday, workers raked sand to level the ground as they laid gray marble
   slabs around the base of the open, stone-lined, tomb. The Palestinians
    consider the grave site as temporary a place for Arafat's body until
   the day they hope they can honor his request to be buried in Jerusalem.

    Flags flew at half-staff in the compound, where Palestinian policemen
     rehearsed rifle drills for the ceremony. Palestinian Prime Minister
    Ahmed Qureia briefly stopped by to inspect progress on Arafat's tomb,
    while outside a few young men sat, heads clasped in their hands, next
             to posters of Arafat and piles of wilting flowers.

      Security was a concern throughout Cairo, with the possibility of
   demonstrations at mosques and in public squares. The Arab public among
        whom Arafat was popular was told to stay away from the area.

   Early Friday, black-uniformed Egyptian police lined Saleh Salem Street
    near the Galaa Club, where the funeral began at 10 a.m. (3 a.m. EST),
     an hour earlier than officials had said it would. An armed soldier
         watched over the club from high in a minaret of the mosque.

    After a traditional funeral prayer lasting only a couple of minutes,
   eight dark-suited pallbearers carried the casket out of the mosque and
    handed it to an Egyptian honor guard. They placed it inside a silver
    hearse and drove away from the mosque; the carriage stood motionless
                      flanked by Egyptian honor guards.

       Egyptian television showed pictures of Mubarak arriving at the
   colorful, red-carpeted tent on the grounds of the military club. There,
     Farouk Kaddoumi, newly chosen leader of the Fatah organization, and
   Abbas could be seen standing with Arafat's nephew, Palestinian envoy to
         the United Nations Nasser al-Kidwa, to receive condolences.

     Among the dignitaries inside the tent were Syrian President Bashar
   Assad, Sultan Hasanal Bolkiah of Brunei, South African President Thabo
      Mbeki, European Union Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana and Pope
            Shenouda III, head of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church.

    U.N. envoy for the Middle East and a key player in the talks that led
     to the 1993 Oslo peace accord, Terje Roed-Larsen, briefly left the
        reception tent to give an interview to The Associated Press.

      "I grieve with the Palestinian people. The symbol of Palestinian
   identity, the symbol of their aspirations for nationhood, the symbol of
   their aspirations for a Palestinian state has passed away," Roed-Larsen
    said. "Yasser Arafat was more important for Palestinian identity than
                   their flag and their national anthem."

    He said he hoped the new Palestinian leadership would return to peace
                          negotiations with Israel.

   A plane carrying Arafat's coffin arrived late Thursday at Cairo airport
    from a Paris military base. Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of the Egyptian
         president, hugged Arafat's widow, Suha, after she alighted.

     Arafat's coffin was then taken to the nearby Galaa Club, a compound
   that includes a hospital, mosque and social club for military officers.
     It remained in the hospital until being taken to the mosque. Beyond
      usual security concerns, the funeral was designed to prevent any
    outpouring of public emotion that could evolve into angry protests or
   merely show the late Palestinian leader as more popular than other Arab
     leaders. Many Arabs have accused their own governments of doing too
        little to help the Palestinians through the latest uprising.

   Egyptian authorities went out of their way to tell the public to steer
                    clear of the suburban Cairo funeral.

       "I would like to draw your attention to something that is very
      important: It's an official military funeral and not open to the
       public," Col. Ahmed Assem of the Interior Ministry told Egypt's
                      state-run television on Thursday.

       The U.S. Embassy in Cairo warned Americans to avoid areas where
   spontaneous protests might occur, including the downtown Tahrir Square,
                    a traditional site of demonstrations.

    In Jerusalem, Israeli police also took steps to prevent rioting, with
    plans to impose restrictions on entry to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound
    for prayers on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A
     police statement said only men over 45 with Israeli identification
         cards will be allowed to enter the mosque compound, Islam's
        third-holiest shrine. The restrictions do not apply to women.

                     China, Asean to advance free trade
                        By Sun Shangwu (China Daily)
                          Updated: 2004-11-29 15:21

    VIENTIANE, Laos: China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
   (ASEAN) are expected to make substantial progress in advancing the free
           trade area (FTA) at their summit to be held here today.

    The two sides will sign a series of agreements, the most prominent of
      which are the two known as the Agreement on Trade in Goods of the
     Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation between
     ASEAN and China, and the Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

     Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao arrived in Vientiane yesterday. He is in
   Laos Sunday through Tuesday for a group summit between China and ASEAN,
    a three-way meeting between China, Japan and the Republic of Korea as
   well as an official visit to Laos. Wen will witness the signing of all
                                 agreements.

   The signing of the two agreements shows that co-operation between China
        and ASEAN has been developed from the framework level to more
     substantial content, said Zhai Kun, a researcher on Southeast Asian
       affairs with the China Institute of Contemporary International
                                 Relations.

    The agreements have paved the way for building up a China-ASEAN FTA,
    and are expected to create a win-win situation for economic and trade
                            relations, said Zhai.

      It will have positive and far-reaching influence on the regional
                   economic integration in Asia, he said.

     Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao speaks during a trilateral meeting with
    Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korea's President
     Roh Moo-hyun on the sidelines of the 10th Association of Southeast
     Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Vientiane, Laos, November 29, 2004.

     Insiders say the two sides have decided to start reducing tariffs,
           which should be down to zero for most products by 2010.

       Leaders from China and the 10-member ASEAN signed the Framework
     Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation in November 2002,
   expressing their willingness to set up an FTA. They plan to complete it
                              within 10 years.

   The establishment of the free trade area will boost the development of
   an economic region with 1.7 billion consumers, about US$1.8 trillion in
   GDP and US$1.2 trillion in trade volume. The FTA will allow all members
     to enjoy more favourable treatment in trade and investment than the
                     World Trade Organization can offer.

      "To push regional integration and develop FTAs has become a world
     trend, and countries in East Asia should follow," said Vice-Foreign
                             Minister Wu Dawei.

    He told a news briefing at the ASEAN summit last week in Beijing that
   both China and ASEAN are very positive in pushing regional integration.

    Regional co-operation between China and ASEAN is good for China, its
   neighbours and the world, said Su Hao, a professor at the Beijing-based
                         Foreign Affairs University.

    Economic co-operation is an important part of the 10+3 partnership of
         ASEAN plus China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, said Su.

     Leaders of member countries gather for the signing ceremony on the
     Vientiane Action Programme during the 10th Association of Southeast
    Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Vientiane, Laos on November 29, 2004.

   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand,
                the Philippines, Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia.

      The 10+3 summit started in December 1997 and Chinese leaders have
                        attended all summit meetings.

     Forty-six dialogue mechanisms at different levels have so far been
    established in 16 fields, including 12 ministerial-level co-operative
           mechanisms, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

   Professor Su told China Daily that China had enjoyed many advantages in
                     setting up FTAs with ASEAN members.

    The performance of different industrial sectors in China's economies
           are varied with some quite advanced and others lagging.

    Such an economic structure allows China to co-operate with all ASEAN
   members with their economic development at different stages. This means
   they share a lot of common ground, ranging from the advanced financial
                     sector to the agricultural sector.

   While facilitating trade, it is inevitable that countries involved will
    encounter a certain amount of friction, and countries and governments
               are on occasion required to intervene, Su said.

      "The establishment of the mechanism for settling disputes is very
                    necessary and significant," he said.

                         Comprehensive co-operation

    Trade between China and the Southeast Asian block is developing very
                                  quickly.

    Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that since 1990, ASEAN
    has been the fifth largest trade partner of China for 11 consecutive
                                   years.

   Trade volumes in the first 10 months of this year hit US$84.61 billion,
             up 35.2 per cent over the same period of last year.

   Officials and experts, including Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi, predicted
   that total bilateral trade volume is expected to exceed US$100 billion
                                 this year.

    China has a trade deficit with the 10-member ASEAN, but hopes to see
    trade balance out as the region grows, said Vice-Foreign Minister Wu
                                   Dawei.

    "For this temporary trade imbalance China has taken a very realistic
     stance," Wu said. "I think in the long run, in our trading ties and
                 economic co-operation we will all benefit."

        During the summit, China and ASEAN are also going to sign the
      ASEAN-China Plan of Action to Implement the Joint Declaration on
               Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity.

    The Memorandum of Understanding between the Governments of the Member
   Countries of ASEAN and China on Transport Co-operation has already been
                                   signed.

   Zhang Chunxian, China's communications minister, who attended the Third
   ASEAN-China Transport Minister's Meeting in Phnom Penn last week, said
    ASEAN-China transport co-operation is becoming more consolidated with
     each step forward and has become an essential part of building up a
   partnership of mutual trust and practical co-operation between the two
                                   sides.

    Zhang said the memorandum will become a legally based medium-to-long
                   term partnership between the two sides.

         He put forward proposals to improve transport co-operation.

    "A 'result-and action-oriented' principle should be observed and more
   attention focused on promoting specific projects while harmonizing the
   development of different modes of transport to deliver more benefits to
                          the people," Zhang said.

      China and ASEAN has made progress in advancing partnership in the
   transport sector, for example, the construction of the Laos section of
   the Kunming-Bangkok Highway; the navigation channel improvement project
   on the upper Mekong River; the feasibility study of the missing link of
      the Trans-Asian Railway inside Cambodia; and the fact that direct
     flights are now in service between major cities in China and ASEAN
                                 countries.

          China's relation with ASEAN has improved in recent years.

      Premier Wen attended the last summit with ASEAN leaders in Bali,
                            Indonesia a year ago.

      At that time, China had developed a strategic partnership geared
    towards peace and prosperity with ASEAN, and was the only major power
   outside the ASEAN to join the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation (TAC) in
                               Southeast Asia.

    The partnership shows that the political relationship between the two
   sides has reached the highest level, said Zhai, adding that the TAC is
          a guarantee for dealing with security issues peacefully.

   When the FTA process is initiated, China-ASEAN relations will have been
                developing in a comprehensive way, he added.

                  Microsoft debuts MSN Spaces for bloggers
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-12-02 11:13

    Hoping to keep more Internet users in its branded universe, Microsoft
    Corp. has become the latest company to offer blogging to the masses.

   MSN Spaces, which debuts in test form Thursday, makes it easy to set up
   Web journals without needing highly technical skills. It is targeted at
   home users who want to share vacation pictures, text journals or a list
                             of favorite songs.

     2002. Microsoft announced it would set up its second Asian research
         facility in India's technology hub of Bangalore. [AFP/file]
    It is free to anyone with a Hotmail e-mail or MSN Messenger account,
     both of which also are free. MSN Spaces will be supported by banner
                                    ads.

   Plenty of other companies already offer similar tools for creating and
      maintaining Web logs that track everything from workday antics to
                              political gossip.

    Microsoft rival America Online Inc. has provided its members with AOL
    Journals since mid-2003, and search engine leader Google Inc. another
   key Microsoft competitor offers a free service through its Blogger.com
      site. The makers of the Movable Type blogging software offer the
             popular TypePad service, starting at $4.95 a month.

   Microsoft already offers MSN Groups for people to create their own Web
   site, but this is the first time it is focusing on the growing blogging
                                 phenomenon.

         Noting that Microsoft has initially missed the boat on some
     technologies, such as Web search, Jupiter Research analyst Michael
     Gartenberg said companies must offer these products early, or risk
                 losing them to rival services permanently.

   Although Microsoft trails Google and AOL, Gartenberg said it's not too
    late because blogging is only just catching on with mainstream users.

   According to a February report from the Pew Internet and American Life
      Project, only 2 percent of Americans have created blogs, while 11
                     percent have read those of others.

   Microsoft is closely linking MSN Spaces with its Messenger and Hotmail
   programs on the premise that people will hop from one Microsoft product
                    to another for online communications.

      For example, users can set up a system that alerts friends on MSN
      Messenger when they have new blog entries. Bloggers can choose to
     restrict access to a select group of friends and family, but guests
   will need to use Microsoft's "Passport" to log in. The most common way
              to do so is to sign up for Hotmail or Messenger.

    Users can update their MSN Spaces from the Web or remotely via e-mail
       or cell phone. AOL lets users update via its instant messenger
                                  software.

     Microsoft also is tying MSN Spaces with other offerings like music
       sales, stepping up its competition with such companies as Apple
   Computer Inc. and Google. One tool lets users create a list of favorite
      music, with automatic links to Microsoft's MSN Music site, where
        Microsoft is hoping to build a business selling songs online.

    Blake Irving, a Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of MSN's
   communications efforts, said the company has no plans to offer similar
                   links to rivals such as Apple's iTunes.

     The final version of MSN Spaces is expected by next June. While the
   company plans to keep MSN Spaces free, Irving wouldn't rule out a paid,
                     premium blog service down the road.

    Google no longer sells a premium service, opting instead to fold the
                    extra features into the free version.

    An update to MSN Messenger, also debuting in test from Thursday, will
     add Microsoft's MSN search bar to a tab on the software. Users also
    will be able to highlight and click on a group of words in an instant
                         message to search the Web.

    Microsoft also will make it easier to send instant messages through a
     Web-based interface so users can communicate if even that computer
               doesn't have the Messenger software installed.

    Steven Gerrard has crashed home a stunning half-volley as four-times
    European champions Liverpool came back to beat Olympiakos Piraeus 3-1
            and advance to the Champions League knockout rounds.

      Liverpool's Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal against Olympiakos
    Piraeus in their Champions League Group A soccer match at Anfield in
     Liverpool, December 8, 2004. Liverpool won the match 3-1. [Reuters]
      Wednesday's result, coupled with Monaco's 5-0 win over Deportivo
    Coruna, put Liverpool into the last 16 and banished Olympiakos to the
                                  UEFA Cup.

   Liverpool appeared to be heading out of the competition when Brazilian
     Rivaldo netted with a free kick to fire the Greek side ahead on 27
                             minutes at Anfield.

       The goal meant Liverpool had to score three times to qualify at
                      Olympiakos's expense in Group A.

      Substitute Florent Sinama Pongolle, a halftime replacement, gave
    Liverpool some hope when he converted Harry Kewell's cross from close
                   range at the start of the second half.

      Rafa Benitez's side then had a second goal harshly ruled out but
    substitute Neil Mellor set up a grandstand finale when he lashed in a
                      second goal 10 minutes from time.

    Liverpool captain and England midfielder Gerrard then raised the roof
   on 86 minutes when he latched on to a cross from the left to thump home
                               from 25 metres.

                 Bus hijackers surrender, 18-hour siege over
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-12-16 07:59

    Two armed men who hijacked a public bus and threatened to blow it up
      surrendered just after midnight Wednesday and released their six
               remaining hostages, ending an 18-hour standoff.

     The freed hostages left the bus from the driver's door, and heavily
   armed police then searched the vehicle. The two hijackers, believed to
      be Albanians, left the bus with their hands on their heads after
                     throwing two shotguns out the door.

   Greek police elite forces walk towards a hijacked bus on a street some
       30 kilometres north of Athens December 15, 2004. Two gunmen who
   hijacked a Greek bus carrying 26 passengers on Wednesday want to go to
   Athens airport to leave the country, the head of the bus company said.

   Greek police elite forces walk towards a hijacked bus on a street some
       30 kilometres north of Athens December 15, 2004. Two gunmen who
   hijacked a Greek bus carrying 26 passengers on Wednesday want to go to
   Athens airport to leave the country, the head of the bus company said.
                                  [Reuters]
     It was unclear what caused the hijackers to surrender. None of the
                         freed captives were harmed.

    The hijackers had initially seized 26 hostages, but the bus driver, a
        ticket inspector and a passenger escaped almost immediately.

     The hostage ordeal ended after the armed men gradually released 17
   other passengers earlier Wednesday. Relatives of the hostages, who were
          waiting in a nearby supermarket, ran up and hugged them.

   At one point during the standoff, a hijacker threatened to blow up the
    bus if authorities did not deliver a ransom of $1.33 million by dawn
                                  Thursday.

   The hijackers were armed with two pump action shotguns, which they were
      seen firing out of a bus window. It remained unclear whether they
                          actually had explosives.

    They seized control of the intercity bus at 5:50 a.m. Wednesday at a
     bus stop in the Athens suburb of Geraka, about 10 miles east of the
                                city center.

   Police praised the driver for his escape, which immobilized the bus and
                gave authorities control over the situation.

    The hijackers initially demanded a new bus driver, saying they wanted
               to be taken to the airport and flown to Russia.

     surrounded the bus after two armed men hijacked it early Wednesday

       A police car is seen behind a hijacked bus on a street some 30
      kilometres north of Athens December 15, 2004. Greek police forces
     surrounded the bus after two armed men hijacked it early Wednesday
     morning with 26 passengers on board on its way from northern Athens
                   suburbs to the Greek capital. [Reuters]
   The hijackers at first claimed to be Russian, but sources in the Athens
   prosecutor's office said both men were Albanians with criminal records
       in Greece. The officials speculated the men tried to hide their
         identities by pretending to be of a different nationality.

   They began releasing hostages in the early afternoon. Some looked dazed
     and confused as they staggered off the bus. One woman limped toward
            black-clad anti-terrorist, who waived her to safety.

   Premier Costas Caramanlis delayed a trip to a European Union summit in
     Brussels, Belgium, Thursday to deal with the crisis, his spokesman
      said. A scheduled demonstration by Greece's main workers union to
            protest the rising cost of living also was postponed.

   Hundreds of thousands of immigrants live in Greece, including many from
                    Albania and the former Soviet Union.

   The hijacking was a first test for a Greek police force that underwent
     intensive training to deal with such situations during the Olympic
    Games. It also was the fifth time a bus has been hijacked since 1999.

    The bus was on a route from the town of Marathon, east of Athens, to
    the city center. It was hijacked at a stop on a highway renovated for
      the Olympic Games and used for the marathon race, which follows a
          26.2-mile course from ancient Marathon to central Athens.

Green Day’s Idiot Goes To The Head Of The Billboard Class

   Bay Area trio earn their first #1 debut on the Billboard albums chart.
   by Joe D'Angelo 9/29/2004

   A decade after they first found success with Dookie, Green Day are
   having the best week of their 16-year career with their latest album,
   American Idiot.

   Their conceptual seventh LP sold more than 266,000 copies, according to
   Soundscan, to give the Bay Area trio their first #1 debut on the
   Billboard albums chart. Led by its first single, “American Idiot,” the
   album will also top the charts in the U.K., Canada, Japan and
   Australia. It moved more than a million copies worldwide.

   For the bandmembers, next week’s #1 ranking is the pinnacle of
   increasingly improving their songwriting and musicianship every step of
   the way.

   “When you look at all of our records, you can kind of see the
   progression,” bassist Mike Dirnt explained, “but this one definitely
   kind of stands on its own a little bit … or a lot. It’s something we
   look forward to playing for the rest of our lives.”

   By comparison, Green Day’s last album, 2000’s Warning, bowed at #4,
   with more than 155,000 copies sold.

   Green Day’s debut knocks previous chart champ Nelly from his perch,
   though the St. Louis rapper still has a foothold on #2 with Suit, the
   more popular of the pair of albums he released two weeks ago. Its
   companion, Sweat, which sold more than 127,000 copies versus Suit’s
   more than 159,000-copy draw, will dip down to #4.

   After two weeks, Suit, which features the single “My Place” with
   Jaheim, has outsold Sweat, which includes “Flap Your Wings,” by more
   than 86,000 copies.

   Stuck in the middle of the Nelly sandwich is country star Keith Urban,
   whose third solo album, Be Here, moved more than 148,000 copies to take
   the #3 spot.

   Chicago rockers Chevelle are making good on their anti-Ritalin-inspired
   single, “Vitamin R.” The trio’s third album, This Type of Thinking
   (Could Do Us In) has also given them their personal best. It will debut
   at #8 with more than 88,000 copies sold.

   Four albums in next week’s top 10 will drop a pair of spots to make
   room for the three new arrivals, as Tim McGraw’s Live Like You Were
   Dying will appear at #5 (with more than 101,000 copies sold); Ray
   Charles’ Genius Loves Company will come in at #6 (93,000); Now That’s
   What I Call Music! 16 will take #7 (88,000); and Maroon 5’s Songs About
   Jane will bring up the rear at #10 (62,000).

   Ashlee Simpson’s Autobiography will fall farthest of any top-10 album,
   though the 75,000 copies it sold last week parallels its previous
   weekly total more closely than its top-ranking peers.

   Massachusetts metal quintet Shadows Fall will score a top-20 debut with
   their fourth album, War Within, which will take #20.

   As the Killers continue to take their music to the people on their
   current tour, the Las Vegas quartet’s debut album, Hot Fuss, will jump
   up six spots on the chart, to #26, thanks to a 25 percent increase in
   sales.

   Other notable debuts on next week’s chart include Creedence Clearwater
   Revival survivor John Fogerty’s Déjà Vu All Over Again at #23; Elvis
   Costello’s Delivery Man at #40; the Christina Aguilera/ Missy
   Elliott-bolstered soundtrack to “Shark Tale” at #42; Raven-Symone’s
   This Is My Time at #51; Willie Nelson’s Outlaws and Angels at #69; Lil’
   Romeo’s Romeoland at #70; Ben Harper with the Blind Boys of Alabama’s
   There Will Be a Light at #81; the Alchemist’s 1st Infantry at #101;
   Colonel Claypool’s Bucket of Bernie Brains’ Big Eyeball in the Sky at
   #118; and Skye Sweetnam’s Noise From the Basement at #124.

   Of A Punk Opera.”

   Sony will next week ship its most impressive Clié PDA yet. The PEG-VZ90
   multimedia handheld features not only a slick sliding control panel,
   but Wi-Fi wireless connectivity and a stunning 3.8in 480 x 320 OLED
   screen.

                             Sony Clie PEG-VZ90

   The display provides a contrast ratio of 1000:1, a fast response time
   and a 180-degree horizontal viewing angle, Sony said.

   Pitched at mobile multimedia applications, the VZ90 can play MPEG 4,
   MPEG 1 video, along with ATRAC 3 digital audio. Sony also says it will
   handle MP3 files, but at this stage it's not clear whether such songs
   are transcoded to ATRAC 3 when they're transferred to the Clié, as is
   the case with other Sony kit that the company claims play MP3s.

   Sony Clie PEG-VZ90 The handheld is based on Palm OS 5.2.1 and contains
   Sony's Clié Organiser PIM apps. The device is driven by Sony's own
   123MHz ARM-compatible CPU, the Handheld Engine. Inside is 64MB of RAM,
   40MB of which is available to the user, along with 128MB of Flash ROM,
   95MB of which can be used for data storage.

   The VZ90 has a Memory Stick Pro slot and a CompactFlash bay. There's a
   USB interface, infra-red and 802.11b

   Power comes courtesy of a 1300mAh battery, which provides between four
   and 12 hours' video playback, depending on the brightness of the
   screen. When an OLED screen pixel is black, it's off and thus consumes
   no power, unlike a backlit LCD which is using energy even when the
   screen is blank.

   Sony claims the VZ90 will play audio for 42 hours, with the display
   blank, and run for 18 days when used as a PDA.

   The unit measures 10.9 x 8.7 x 2.3cm and weighs 270g. It is set to go
   on sale in Japan on 25 September, for ¥95,000 (£481/$863). Now that
   Sony has formally announced its decision to suspend Clié sales in the
   US and Europe, it seems unlikely we'll see a local-language version of
   the device over here. ®

   WASHINGTON — As the nation prepared for a severe shortage of flu shots,
   the Food and Drug Administration said Monday that problems at the
   British plant that manufactured vaccine withheld by British authorities
   likely will be used as a “test case” to lobby for better
   information-sharing with European regulators.

   Last Tuesday, British authorities blocked Chiron Corp. from shipping 46
   million to 48 million doses of flu vaccine to the United States. The
   FDA, which held weekly telephone conversations with Chiron since Aug.
   25, said it was stunned by the last-minute about-face.

   Lester Crawford, the agency’s acting commissioner, told reporters
   Monday that the agency lacked a data-sharing agreement that would have
   forced its British counterparts to disclose qualms earlier.

   'Laws do not recognize each other'
   British regulators considered the plant’s flu vaccine output “their
   jurisdiction,” he said, with confidentiality concerns limiting their
   discussions with the FDA.

   “As far as we’re concerned, it’s our regulatory responsibility for
   those lots that are coming to the United States,” Crawford said. “I
   wouldn’t say there is a conflict here, but the two laws do not
   recognize each other.”

   Because the number of companies making vaccines continues to shrink,
   and many, like Chiron, conduct such manufacturing abroad, they need to
   be treated like international resources, Crawford said.

   An agency like the World Health Organization could be asked to clarify
   “the rights and privileges” of the importing country, Crawford told
   reporters.

   On Aug. 25, Chiron told British and American regulators of bacterial
   contamination of eight lots of flu vaccine, imperiling up to 8 million
   doses. Crawford would not say if the contaminated lots were among
   vaccine lots the FDA had already cleared for use.

   FDA inspectors were in Liverpool when the contamination concerns
   surfaced, but returned in favor of weekly telephone conferences
   monitoring Chiron’s progress remedying the problem. Crawford defended
   that Monday as standard operating procedure that worked well in the
   past.

   The agency typically sends two employees to inspect Chiron’s
   manufacturing plant in Liverpool. After last week’s license suspension,
   it sent a team of five inspectors.

   “There is a crisis,” Crawford said. The FDA’s fact-finding continues;
   Crawford expects a report as early as this week.

            Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies,
            such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50
            percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are
            puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent
            guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options,
            from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring.

   Flu shot seekers line up at clinics
   Across the nation, flu shot seekers have lined up at clinics for the
   first wave of 55.4 million vaccine doses produced by Aventis Pasteur
   for use in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention had hoped to offer 100 million doses of flu vaccine.

   As federal authorities continue to struggle to cope with a severe
   vaccine shortage, one expert said early signs point to a less dangerous
   flu season than last year.

   “My guess is we are going to have a lighter year than last year,” said
   Dr. Greg Poland, who predicted last year’s staggering flu season. “To
   date, we don’t have any of the indicators that usually portend a bad
   year.”

   Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s vaccine research group and one of
   the government’s vaccine experts, noted that flu outbreaks, thus far,
   have been small and scattered, the virus hasn’t easily jumped from
   person to person and it has not triggered early spikes in
   hospitalizations and deaths.

   In fact, small outbreaks in nursing home facilities in New Jersey, New
   York and Ontario have been the H3N2 strain of influenza A, he said.
   That flu strain can be tamed by antivirals, which lessen illness
   severity among the infected and prevent illness in most healthy adults,
   Poland said.

   The H3N2 strain of influenza A also circulated last year, meaning
   people who were exposed then should be partially protected if it
   remains the dominant flu strain this year.

   Count Dr. Theodore Eickhoff, a University of Colorado professor of
   medicine in the division of infectious diseases, among the skeptics.

   The H3N2 strain is associated with higher death rates among high-risk
   people, including the elderly. “It’s still the bad actor among
   influenza viruses,” Eickhoff said.

   The vaccines prepared for this year cover three strains of flu: the
   H3N2, the A strain H1N1, and a B strain.

   WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge in Washington has directly
   challenged U.S. government lawyers to explain their policies for
   designating enemy combatants and for the continued detention of
   prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

   In a much-anticipated hearing, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Greene
   received few answers as she repeatedly pressed the Justice Department
   attorneys during a four-hour session on whether to dismiss a lawsuit on
   behalf of several detainees.

   "How long will they be held? As long as Islamic fundamentalists are a
   threat?" the judge asked.

   "I wish I could give you an answer," said Justice lawyer Brian Boyle.

   "What can the people who are being held be told is the longest they are
   subject to detention?" the judge wanted to know.

   "I'm not sure what can be told to them," Boyle responded.

   He insisted the detained non-citizens who have been determined to be
   enemy combatants have no constitutional rights. "Their only connection
   to this country is to a desire to attack it," he said.

   Greene, noting "America and the world are watching," indicated she
   would not rule immediately.

   "I will not rush to judgment," she told the packed courtroom.

   In a surprise move, Greene greeted the government attorneys with a
   series of penetrating hypothetical questions to test the limits of the
   administration policy on designating enemy combatants.

   "If a little old lady in Switzerland gave money to a charity for an
   Afghan orphanage, and the money was passed to al Qaeda, could she be
   held as an enemy combatant?" the judge asked.

   Boyle indicated that might fit within the definition of enemy combatant
   and stressed the need to give the executive branch of government wide
   latitude during a time of war.

   "Could a man in London who believes his cousin is a member of al Qaeda
   be an enemy combatant for failing to report his suspicions to
   authorities?" she asked.

   The government attorney said he doubted officials would hold someone
   under that circumstance but did not say they could not do so.

   The judge also pressed on where the battlefield ends in the global war
   on terrorism.

   Boyle summed up the government's great challenge to deal with
   unprecedented and complex issues. "It is like nothing we have seen
   before," he concluded.

   Wednesday's hearing is part of a legal effort to clarify the
   government's handling of enemy combatants following a U.S. Supreme
   Court ruling in June.

   The high court ruled people held at Guantanamo Bay had a right to
   challenge their detention in federal court. The decision significantly
   dampened a key pillar of the government's aggressive anti-terror
   policies.

   About 60 of the detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay have asked for a
   federal court hearing on their status. There are currently about 550
   prisoners at the camp.

   After the hearing lawyers for the detainees blasted the government's
   position, and called some of the responses "shocking."

   "The little old lady in Switzerland who by mistake had given a
   contribution to someone she didn't know to an orphanage in Afghanistan,
   could be picked up by the United States as an enemy combatant. That's
   really a shocking thing," said plaintiffs' lawyer Thomas Wilner.

   "After this statement today I would think that people in the world
   should be terribly afraid that the United States in asserting its power
   could pick up little old ladies, little old men, or anyone who makes a
   mistake, and hold them, and that's a very scary thing," he said.

   Government attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.

Maoist rebels launch Nepal attack

   From Journalist Akhilesh Upadhyay

   KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Hundreds of Maoist rebels attacked a remote
   district headquarters in northwestern Nepal early Sunday, killing at
   least one soldier, according to police.

   The attack happened in Khalanga, the district headquarters of Jumla.

   Six other policemen are missing from Khalanga, apparently abducted by
   the rebels, police said.

   Meanwhile, a fifth day of a Maoist blockade on the Nepalese capital
   Kathmandu has forced the prices of essential commodities to skyrocket.

   Two bombs exploded in Kathmandu Friday. One bomb hit a commercial
   center, wounding two people, while another apparently targeted an empty
   police post on the outskirts of the city, according to news reports.

   Kathmandu is linked to the rest of the kingdom by four major highways.
   The roads also provide a vital link to Indian ports -- the commercial
   lifelines of the landlocked country.

   Though the number of vehicles coming into the Kathmandu Valley
   increased Saturday, most long-distance public buses and cargo trucks
   are still off the road.

   The Maoists are fighting an eight-year rebellion to establish a
   communist republic. More than 10,000 people have died in the Maoists'
   "people's war."
