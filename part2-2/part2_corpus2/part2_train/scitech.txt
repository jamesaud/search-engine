HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments



   By Nicholas Kolakowski  |  Posted 2011-09-07 Print this article Print







HP needs 6-8 weeks to ship additional TouchPads, according to a leaked email
sent to customers. HP is prepping one last run for its defunct tablet.

   Hewlett-Packard will apparently need close to two months to start
   fulfilling backorders for the (temporarily) revived TouchPad tablet.
   "It will take 6-8 weeks to build enough HP TouchPads to meet our
   current commitments, during which time your order will then ship from
   this stock with free ground shipping," read an email sent to customers
   and reprinted in a Sept. 7 posting on the Precentral.net blog. "You
   will receive a shipping notification with a tracking number once your
   order has shipped."
   That would place the new TouchPads in consumers' hands sometime in
   either late October or early November. The reduced-price devices are
   not returnable, according to the email.
   HP originally acquired webOS as part of its takeover of Palm in 2010.
   The manufacturer originally had big plans for loading the operating
   system onto a variety of devices, including tablets, smartphones,
   desktops and laptops. However, sales of its TouchPad proved anemic, and
   HP made the decision to end the tablet's life after a mere six weeks on
   the market. In order to clear out inventory, the manufacturer sliced
   the starting price to $99, which sparked a surge of consumer interest.
   In the wake of that, HP made the decision to revive the line for a
   limited time. In addition, HP plans on dividing its webOS arm into two
   separate units reporting to different areas of the company, according
   to two leaked memos that have made their way onto the Web. The webOS
   software assets will find their way into the arms, however welcoming,
   of its Office of Strategy and Technology. The other parts of the webOS
   corporate infrastructure, presumably including its hardware interests,
   will continue as part of the Personal Systems Group, which manufactures
   HP's PCs, and which will presumably be spun off into its own entity
   under the terms of the company's new strategy. "We have decided that
   we'll be most effective in these efforts by having the teams in webOS
   software engineering, worldwide developer relations and webOS software
   product marketing join the Office of Strategy and Technology," Todd
   Bradley, executive vice president of HP's Personal Systems Group, wrote
   in an email circulated to the webOS developer team and also leaked onto
   Precentral.net. "The remainder of the webOS team, under Stephen DeWitt,
   will continue to report into PSG." According to at least one analyst,
   flooding the market with additional TouchPad devices could have
   significant benefits for HP going forward. A "larger installed base of
   TouchPad and webOS devices should increase the value of webOS in a
   potential sale," Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu wrote in a research note
   widely circulated on Barron's and other financial Websites. "We believe
   logical buyers may include Samsung Electronics, Research In Motion,
   HTC, Amazon.com, Facebook, Sony, Microsoft and others." Follow Nicholas

Dreamless woman remains healthy

   Stroke study suggests humans can live without dreams.

   A woman who stopped dreaming after a stroke is helping researchers
   unravel the mysteries of sleep.

   The 73-year-old patient was admitted to hospital after a stroke
   disrupted blood flow to an area at the back of her brain, called the
   occipital lobe. At first, her symptoms were not unusual - she lost some
   vision and was weak on one side of the body. But as the initial
   problems faded a few days later, a new symptom emerged: the woman had
   stopped dreaming. Her story is recorded in the Annals of Neurology^1.

   She used to experience 3 to 4 dreams per week, says Claudio Bassetti,
   now of University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland, who studied the
   woman. After the stroke, she had no dreams for a whole year, yet her
   sleep and mental functions appeared otherwise unaffected.

   “Dreams are the cinema of the mind.”

   Jim Horne
   Loughborough University

   People have been fascinated by dreams for centuries. Psychologist
   Sigmund Freud believed that dreams offer a release for repressed
   feelings. Others think they help us empty our minds at the end of a
   busy day, or solve problems as we sleep.

   But the stroke study suggests that humans can live without dreams. "I
   don't think they have any real function," comments Jim Horne, who
   studies sleep at Loughborough University, UK.

   "I think that dreams are the cinema of the mind," he continues. "They
   help to keep the brain entertained while we are asleep."

   Bassetti, however, cautions against drawing firm conclusions from a
   single case. "How dreams are generated, and what purpose they might
   serve, are completely open questions at this point," he says.

Brainwave

   To try to discover what was going on, Bassetti's team monitored the
   woman's brain waves as she slept. The researchers took 4 night-long
   recordings over 6 weeks.

   The patient reported no dreams even when woken in the midst of rapid
   eye movement (REM) sleep, which is normally associated with dreaming.
   But to the researchers' surprise, her sleep pattern was perfectly
   normal.

   This shows that REM sleep and dreaming do not always go hand in hand,
   says Bassetti. The occipital lobe, which was damaged by the woman's
   stroke, is likely to play an important role in dreaming. But different
   neural areas, such as the brain stem and midbrain, are thought to
   control REM sleep.

   The study also backs up reports of patients who lost both their dreams
   and their REM sleep for up to a year after taking certain
   antidepressant drugs. "These people don't go mad," says Horne. They are
   completely normal and have no memory problems.

   At present, the functions of REM sleep are as elusive as those of
   dreaming. Adults spend a quarter of their nightly slumber in REM sleep,
   scattered throughout the night. The remaining time is spent deeper in
   unconsciousness. So REM may simply bring the brain back from deep sleep
   periodically to help us wake up if we need to, says Horne.

   But the function may be different in newborns, who typically spend
   around 8 hours per day in REM sleep. Here, the sleep pattern may be
   related to brain development.

XV International AIDS Meeting

   The biennial international AIDS conference is a scientific gathering, a
   chance for politicians to network and an activists’ rally all rolled
   into one. This year, 15,000 people from 160 countries have headed to
   Bangkok, Thailand, from 11 July to 16 July to discuss the scientific,
   economic, political and social dimensions of the global AIDS epidemic.
   Erika Check brings you daily conference news, plus gossip and
   behind-the-scenes coverage.

   Erika Check

   <blogentry><entrydate month='07' time='21:29' daynum='6' day='16'
   year='2004'/> Day 6: The right people?

   This conference had already seen a slew of celebrities this week:
   Richard Gere, Ashley Judd, and Kofi Annan, for starters. But none of
   them - indeed, perhaps no one else on earth - can work a crowd like
   Nelson Mandela.

   At today's closing ceremonies, Mandela told us that he'll be 86 years
   old in two days. He has already announced his retirement from public
   life. However, he said, "I cannot rest until I am certain that the
   global response is sufficient to turn the tide of the epidemic." He
   implored world leaders to give more money to the Global Fund to Fight
   AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Many new donations have been announced
   during the past week - from the European Commission, Thailand, the
   United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the Gates Foundation, But
   Mandela implored everyone to do more. "Allow me to enjoy my retirement
   by showing me that you can rise to the challenge," he said.

   Mandela drew a standing ovation, of course. He moved many people to
   tears, even though they were sitting hundreds of feet away from him in
   a stadium-sized arena.

   It will be difficult to top that act in 2006, when the conference moves
   to Toronto. Indeed, grumbling about the International AIDS Conference
   is a popular pastime nowadays. People complain that there's no new
   science and too much political posturing; too much talk and not enough
   action. All those things may be true.

   But a lot goes on here that doesn't make the newspapers, and sometimes
   that's what actually inspires people to try harder after they leave. At
   the risk of sounding cheesy, I have to say that I've met some
   incredibly inspiring people in Bangkok. Like Joia Mukherjee, a doctor
   who works in one of the poorest parts of Haiti. She helped ensure that
   Haitians continued to receive AIDS drugs during the disintegration of
   the Haitian government this spring. Or Zachie Achmat, a South African
   activist with HIV who refused to take antiretroviral medications until
   his government provided them to its citizens. He finally went on the
   drugs when his friends implored him to. Or a young Ugandan man,
   Ndiwalana Tonny. He works with a group called Aidchild, in Masaka,
   which cares for orphans who get kicked out of the regular orphanages
   because they have HIV.

   Two days ago, Ambassador Randall Tobias, the top US global AIDS
   official, said in an interview that we should think hard about the
   value of this conference before 2006. "I think we need to evaluate
   ...whether or not the right people are coming who really have a need
   and a reason to be here," Tobias said.

   I wonder who "the right people" are. This conference is still far too
   expensive for too many people. But this year, it was less exclusive
   than it has been in the past. More people attended than ever before,
   and many more of them got scholarships. If Tobias had taken the chance
   to leave the podium and talk to some of the 20,000 delegates in the
   hallways this week, he might have decided that many of the right people
   are already here.

   </blogentry><blogentry><entrydate month='07' time='23:32' daynum='5'
   day='15' year='2004'/> Day 5: The battle for drugs

   When you hear that the United States is spending $15 billion to fight
   AIDS around the world, you might wonder why some people here are
   calling the US stingy. It's true that the US spends way more than
   anyone else on AIDS. But the critics say petty political restrictions
   are actually undermining the cause.

   One sticking point is that the US promotes abstinence, which I wrote
   about on Monday. The other huge issue is generic drugs. To people in
   developed countries, "generic drugs" are the substitute medicines you
   buy to save a few dollars at the pharmacy. But to AIDS patients in
   developing countries, generics mean a lot more. A year's worth of
   brand-name AIDS drugs costs $700 in most poor countries - even at
   specially reduced prices. The generic versions cost about $150.

   However, if you get US AIDS money, you're not allowed to buy generic
   drugs with it. You have to buy the brand-name drugs. This is a big
   problem in developing countries, say people who work with AIDS
   patients. Joia Mukherjee is a doctor with Partners in Health, a
   Boston-based group provides free health care in many poor countries,
   including Haiti. Mukherjee said yesterday that her group refused to
   take US money, partly because, she says, "If we had to buy brand name
   drugs, we would have to treat five times fewer patients."

   Mukherjee says that US representatives in Haiti advised her to take the
   money, but use it for something other than drugs. She would then have
   to use money from other sources to buy generic drugs. Mukherjee finds
   that hypocritical. "They're advising us to use the very drugs they say
   aren't safe," she says.

   The US says that since it hasn't approved any generic AIDS drugs in the
   United States, it can't buy generic drugs for other countries. "It is a
   moral imperative that families in programmes funded by the United
   States in the developing world have the same assurances as American
   families that the drugs they use are safe and effective," US Global
   AIDS Coordinator Randall Tobias said in a speech last night. But
   critics accuse Bush and Tobias of kow-towing to drug companies, which
   regularly give Bush's political party about three times as much money
   as to they give to his rivals. Tobias himself is a former executive at
   drug giant Eli Lilly.

   In May, however, Bush's officials said they had created a new process
   so that the US Food and Drug Administration could approve generic AIDS
   drugs quickly. Aid recipients could buy these specially approved drugs
   with US funds. But no company has yet submitted a proposal to the FDA.
   Generics maker Ranbaxy, based in New Delhi, is represented here at the
   meeting. Atul Chhabra, manager of its HIV project, told me today that
   the companies are waiting because the FDA hasn't told them what the new
   process requires. I called a US representative of another major
   generics maker - Cipla, also based in India - and he basically said the
   same thing. "The moment they clarify the situation, the companies will
   start moving," Chhabra said. But, he added, that probably won't happen
   until January or February next year at the earliest.

   This just isn't good enough, say recipients of US aid. Mark Isaac is
   with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which is using US
   money to give AIDS drugs to children and families in Ivory Coast,
   Zambia, Tanzania and South Africa. "All parties need to move quickly to
   show the new process is going to work instead of engaging in
   finger-pointing," Isaac says. Sadly, that just isn’t happening at the
   moment.

   Sud Lor has been cleared!

   Bangkok's The Nation newspaper reports today that the elephant that
   killed a man on Monday was actually an animal named Plai Thongdee - not
   Sud Lor, who had been blamed for the attack.

   Thongdee's mahout, Pheng Yeerum, turned himself in to police today. He
   said that his elephant had killed 59-year-old Somsak Klongkaew after
   Somsak got drunk and started yanking hairs from Plai Thongdee's tail.

   "Plai Thondee became irritated by Somsak and wrapped his trunk around
   the victim before tossing him. The throw resulted in Somsak's death,"
   Pheng said, according to The Nation.

   Pheng apparently then freaked out and led Plai Thongdee away, to a
   corral that houses Sud Lor and the other elephants which have been
   performing for us at the conference. But Plai Thongdee himself was not
   one of the hired performers. In fact, he and his mahout are poor and
   sometimes had to beg from tourists to make a living, The Nation
   reports.

   I was very curious to know what the mahouts thought of all this. So
   today I headed out to the Moo Ban Chang - the Elephant Village, where
   the conference elephants live during the day. It's a few minutes' walk
   away from the convention center and across a busy road.

   Well, the Elephant Village certainly didn't seem like a dangerous area
   filled with violent beasts. All of the animals were very neatly attired
   in red headdresses, jackets, and tusk decorations. One reached its
   trunk out to me, but I think he was just looking for a handout of sugar
   cane. It was really hot outside, so one of the baby elephants was
   drowsily dousing himself with water from a hose. And most of the others
   were ambling around the corral giving rides to the few conferencegoers
   who had trekked over.

   I talked to a Czech woman there named Lenka Pilovsova, who explained
   that she is working with the elephants during a two-month break from
   her post as a molecular biologist at the Masaryk Univeristy in Brno.
   Lenka explained that Thai elephants have a huge problem: they have all
   lost their jobs. Most of them used to work in the logging industry in
   the forests of Thailand. But now the loggers use machines instead, and
   the elephants are out of luck and on the streets. Most of their mahouts
   either abandon them or take them out begging, as with Plai Thongdee.

   Lenka said the mahouts try very hard to take good care of their
   animals. Which is why, according to Lenka, the mahouts at the Elephant
   Village were not surprised to hear that Plai Thongdee had killed Somsak
   for pulling his tail. "They all know that if you don't treat the
   elephant well, it can be a dangerous animal," Lenka said.

   </blogentry><blogentry><entrydate month='07' time='10:17' daynum='4'
   day='14' year='2004'/> Day 4: The dark side

   By now, if you're reading anything at all about this meeting, you're
   probably catching on to the fact that many, many people here are angry
   at the United States. Protesters and irate conferencegoers slam any US
   official who dares to show his or her face in public here. Maybe that's
   why the top US official at the conference, Global AIDS Coordinator
   Randall Tobias, sent an underling named Mark Dybul to stand in for him
   at a debate session on Monday.

   Interestingly enough, it turns out that Dybul came to Tobias's office
   straight from the lab of Anthony Fauci, head of the US National
   Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci is widely regarded
   by many activists, scientists, and government officials as one of the
   "good guys" in the fight against AIDS - he has been pushing for more
   AIDS research for decades. So activists regard Dybul's move to Tobias's
   office as a major betrayal. "He's gone over to the dark side," one
   long-time activist said after the Monday session.

   Dybul fielded a huge array of indignant questions and tirades against
   US AIDS policies on Monday. Everything from, "We are sick and tired of
   the United States using this conference as a PR platform," to "200
   million? That's crap!" referring to the US contribution to the
   multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
   Dybul, the deputy chief medical officer for Tobias's office, stayed
   very calm, cool, and collected, but you couldn't help but get the
   feeling that he had been sent to the wolves.

   Fauci told me yesterday that Dybul worked in his lab as a scientist for
   years before moving to Tobias's office when it was created last year.
   Officially, said Fauci, Dybul is on a temporary assignment to the State
   Department. But on Monday, Dybul had this to say about his new job:
   "I've been doing HIV/AIDS work for 20 years, and I'm so incredibly
   proud to represent President Bush and the American people on this,"
   Dybul said. "It's an opportunity I've been waiting for 20 years."

   Doesn't sound like he'll be going back to the lab any time soon.

   day='13' year='2004'/> Day 3: Elephants - but no traffic - on the
   streets

   Sadly, our conference has become entangled with a local tragedy. The
   Thai newspapers reported today that a man was attacked and killed
   yesterday - by a rampaging elephant. The animal was apparently one of
   about 20 elephants that starred in the opening ceremonies for our
   conference on Sunday night.

   According to the papers, the elephant attacked and killed 55-year-old
   man named Somsak Klangkaew, a construction worker who had been living
   under a highway overpass. The police then conducted a forensic
   investigation by testing the dirt samples under many elephants' feet
   and matching them to the site where the man was killed. The
   investigation implicated a 19-year-old male elephant named Sud Lor,
   which translates as 'Absolute Handsome'.

   The animals seemed so cute and docile on Sunday night, parading down
   the street outside the conference center, decorated with pretty paper
   flowers on their tusks and anklets on their chubby legs...

   Sud Lor's mahout - his keeper and trainer - said that the elephant was
   feeling "strong sexual urges" yesterday, according to the
   English-language newspaper The Nation. The newspaper also reported that
   the mahout, Virapong Somwang, defended his animal from the police,
   protesting that Sud Lor was very well trained and would never hurt
   anyone. Virapong even sank to the ground in front of Sud Lor, the paper
   reports, "sarcastically asking it to gore him". In response, the paper
   says, "Sud Lor kneeled down near [Virapong] and cried."

   The papers also answered a mystery that had been nagging at me for
   days. I had heard before the conference that horrendous traffic often
   clogs Bangkok's streets, especially at rush hours. But every morning
   when we pile in buses to head out to the conference center, the streets
   are way less congested than they are back home in Washington, DC. In
   fact, I haven't seen a single traffic jam since I arrived.

   Now I know why - apparently the prime minister let all the kids off
   from school, for the duration of the entire conference. Lucky kids!

   day='12' year='2004'/> Day 2: The humble condom

   With cutting-edge antiretroviral drugs and new vaccines at the top of
   the AIDS agenda these days, it's surprising - almost shocking - how
   much this conference has focused on an ancient, low-tech device: the
   humble condom.

   Condoms were around long before AIDS existed. Yet here we are, more
   than 20 years after the start of the AIDS epidemic, arguing about
   whether condoms stop the spread of AIDS. The issue has come up at this
   conference every time there is a discussion about the US programme on
   AIDS - and that's pretty often, because the United States spends more
   on global AIDS programmes than any other nation.

   One session today was set up as a formal debate between ABC (abstinence
   until marriage, be faithful to one partner, use condoms) and CNN
   (condoms, needles and negotiating skills). The United States under
   President Bush has heavily promoted the so-called ABC strategy in its
   foreign AIDS programmes. But ABC-haters say that American programmes
   tend to emphasize the A and the B over the C. And the US Congress has
   voted to require one-third of all global AIDS prevention funding to go
   solely towards A and B - abstinence and monogamy.

   Today's session quickly degenerated into a food fight about condoms,
   with most of the delegates angrily attacking the ABC-ers. One delegate
   from Brazil stood up, declared that he hated President Bush, and vowed
   that Brazil would never use the ABC strategy. Another delegate from
   Mexico asked 23-year-old Ugandan Simon Peter Onaha, who spoke out in
   favour of ABC, rather personal questions about his own abstinence and
   whether he would promote masturbation. Onaha simply replied, "I would
   highly recommend the ABC strategy, because it has worked for Uganda,
   and it has worked for me."

   Uganda as a nation has obviously made huge progress against its AIDS
   epidemic by using the ABC strategy. But the critics say that strategy
   offers little hope for many individuals elsewhere - including women,
   who often don't have the option to say no to sex.

   Arushi Singh, a youth volunteer for the International Planned
   Parenthood Federation in India, hammered home the point that many women
   in South Asia and elsewhere simply can't ask their partners to wear
   condoms. And ABC leaves women married to HIV-positive men completely in
   the lurch - especially in cultures where wives are taught to obey the
   demands of their husbands. Singh said these women must ask themselves:
   "Can I say no to this man I respect as a god, and not face a beating,
   or even be thrown out of the house?" Sadly, this scenario is not rare:
   in some parts of Africa, the majority of women who contract HIV now get
   it from their husbands. These women obviously need something more than
   a neat-sounding alphabetical slogan to protect themselves from AIDS.

   day='11' year='2004'/> Day 1: Let the Protests Begin

   The XV International AIDS Conference opened with the requisite protests
   today in Bangkok.

   The theme for the meeting is "Access for All". But this afternoon,
   hundreds of activists marched outside the Bangkok convention center to
   protest the lack of global access to treatment and prevention
   programmes, especially in developing countries. The activists - mostly
   Thai - carried signs in Thai and English with slogans like, "Science
   not politics - Access to condoms for all!" and "Bush's free trade deals
   kill - Generic AIDS drugs now".

   Three major AIDS officials met the protesters outside - Peter Piot,
   executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
   (UNAIDS); Joep Lange, president of the International AIDS Society, and
   Richard Feachem, head of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
   and Malaria. But the US representative Randall Tobias, head of the
   President's Emergency programme for AIDS Relief, declined protesters'
   requests that he go outside and receive a document listing their
   demands. "Why don't you just give [the document] to me here?" he asked
   one activist who confronted him during a press conference today.

   “The crowd did not stick around long enough to hear the only speech by
   a person with HIV”

   Protesters also disrupted a speech by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin
   Shinawatra at the opening ceremony this evening. The Thais have been
   praised by many global AIDS leaders for taking early and effective
   action against the AIDS epidemic. But the Thai government has come
   under fierce criticism for its position on injecting drug users, who
   make up one third of newly diagnosed HIV cases in the country. Thailand
   has banned needle exchange programmes, and activists allege that
   thousands of drug users have been jailed or killed in a nationwide war
   on drugs. When Thaksin touched on this subject in his speech,
   protesters stood up shouting and brandishing "Clean needles now"
   posters. But Thaksin still got a standing ovation from the crowd, which
   appreciated his pledge to provide free treatment to everyone who needs
   it in Thailand, and his message of tolerance and equality for people
   with HIV.

   The opening ceremonies also featured a handful of celebrities - Miss
   Universe 2004, movie actor Richard Gere, and UN Secretary General Kofi
   Annan, who was treated more like a rock star than a diplomat by the
   crowd. Annan got his own standing ovation for insisting that nations
   must to do more to empower women and girls. "Only when societies
   recognize that educating girls is not an option, but a necessity, will
   girls and young women be able to build the knowledge, the
   self-confidence and the independence they need to protect themselves
   from HIV/AIDS," Annan said.

   Sadly, the crowd of thousands did not stick around at the opening
   ceremonies long enough to hear the night's only speech by a person with
   HIV. Thai activist Paisan Sawannawong, leader of the Thai Drug User's
   Network, spoke out against high medication prices and against Thai
   policies on drug users. But he was the night's last speaker, and the
   Thai prime minister and most of the crowd had already left the building
   by the time he took the podium. Those who had stayed lamented that the
   situation epitomized a perennial problem in the global AIDS epidemic -
   and perhaps with the AIDS conferences themselves: too much emphasis on
   the people who already have political and economic power, and to little
   focus on the people who live with the disease.

   Battered and grooved: Saturn's moon Tethys
   CASSINI PHOTO RELEASE
   Posted: November 27, 2004

   Having now passed closer to Tethys than the Voyager 2 spacecraft,
   Cassini has returned the best-ever natural color view of this icy
   Saturnian moon.

   Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute
   Download larger image version here

   As seen here, the battered surface of Tethys (1,060 kilometers, or 659
   miles across) has a neutral hue. The image here is a mosaic of two
   footprints. Three images taken in the red, green and blue filters were
   taken to form a natural color composite. The result reveals a world
   nearly saturated with craters - many small craters lie on top of older,
   larger ones, suggesting an ancient surface. At the top and along the
   boundary between day and night, the moon's terrain has a grooved
   appearance.

   This moon is known to have a density very close to that of water,
   indicating it is likely composed mainly of water ice. Its frozen
   mysteries await Cassini's planned close flyby in September 2005.

   The view shows primarily the trailing hemisphere of Tethys, which is
   the side opposite the moon's direction of motion in its orbit. The
   image has been rotated so that north on Tethys is up.

   The images comprising this color view were taken with the Cassini
   spacecraft narrow angle camera on Oct. 28, 2004, at a distance of about
   256,000 kilometers (159,000 miles) from Tethys and at a
   Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 50 degrees. The image scale
   is 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) per pixel.

   The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
   European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
   Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of
   Space Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
   cameras, were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging
   team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

   Before and after look at Saturn's moon Titan
   CASSINI PHOTO RELEASE
   Posted: December 16, 2004

   Cassini's second close flyby of Titan completes a 'before' and 'after'
   look at the fuzzy moon and provides the first direct evidence of
   changing weather patterns in the skies over Titan.

   Cassini has found Titan's upper atmosphere to consist of a surprising
   number of layers of haze, as shown in this ultraviolet image of Titan's
   night side limb, colorized to look like true color. Credit:

   In images obtained less than two months ago, the Titan skies were cloud
   free, except for a patch of clouds observed over the moon's south pole.
   In images taken Monday, Dec. 13, during Cassini's second close flyby of
   Titan, several extensive patches of clouds have formed.

   "We see for the first time discrete cloud features at mid-latitudes,
   which means we see direct evidence of weather, and we can get wind
   speeds and atmospheric circulation over a region we hadn't been able to
   measure before," said Dr. Kevin Baines, Cassini science-team member
   with the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, from NASA's Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

   The latest data and other results from Cassini's close observations of
   Saturn's moons Titan and Dione were presented today at a news
   conference during the American Geophysical Union fall meeting in San
   Francisco.

   Cassini swept within 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) of Titan's surface on
   Monday, and took a close look at the icy moon Dione just one day later.
   During the flyby, Cassini captured a stunning view of Titan's night
   side with the atmosphere shimmering in its own glow. This allows
   scientists to study the detached haze layers, which extend some 400
   kilometers (249 miles) above Titan.

   Images from Cassini's cameras show regions on Titan that had not been
   seen clearly before, as well as fine details in Titan's intermittent
   clouds. The surface features may be impact related, but without
   information on their height, it is too soon to know for sure. No
   definitive craters have been seen in these images, though several
   bright rings or circular features are seen in dark terrain.

   Cassini imaging scientists are intrigued by the complex braided
   structure of surface fractures on Dione. To the surprise of scientists,
   the wispy terrain features do not consist of thick ice deposits, but
   bright ice cliffs created by tectonic features. "This is one of the
   most surprising results so far. It just wasn't what we expected," said
   Dr. Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team leader, Space Science
   Institute, Boulder, Colo.

   As it zoomed in on Saturn's moon Dione for a close flyby, the Cassini
   spacecraft captured a set of images of the icy moon which have been
   combined into a mosaic here to provide a stunningly detailed global
   view. Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute

   Other Cassini results presented at the meeting included observations
   made by the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph instrument, which
   indicates that the nearby environment of the rings and moons in the
   Saturn system is filled with ice, and atoms derived from water. Cassini
   researchers are seeing large changes in the amount of oxygen atoms in
   the Saturn system. A possible explanation for the fluctuation in oxygen
   is that small, unseen icy moons have been colliding with Saturn's E
   ring," said Dr. Larry Esposito, principal investigator of the imaging
   spectrograph instrument, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo. "These
   collisions may have produced small grains of ice, which yielded oxygen
   atoms." Esposito presented these findings at the meeting, and a paper
   on the subject appears in the online version of the journal Science.

   According to Esposito, Saturn's ring particles may have formed
   originally from pure ice. But they have since been subjected to
   continual bombardment by meteorites, which has contaminated the ice and
   caused the rings to darken. Over time, continuous meteorite bombardment
   has likely spread the dirty material resulting from the collisions over
   a wide area in the rings. "The evidence indicates that in the last 10
   to 100 million years, fresh material probably was added to the ring
   system," said Esposito. These renewal events are from fragments of
   small moons, each probably about 20 kilometers (12 miles) across.

Volcanoes May Have Sparked Life on Earth, Study Says

   John Roach
   for National Geographic News
   October 7, 2004

   Before life evolved on Earth, most scientists believe that amino
   acids—molecules that are the basic building blocks of life—were first
   formed via interactions on Earth or brought to it via collisions with
   comets and meteorites.

   "But how did [the amino acids] form peptides [which are necessary for
   living cells]? What is the condensing agent?" said Reza Ghadiri, a
   molecular chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
   California. "That is a major problem."

   Peptides are chains of amino acids. They form the proteins that are the
   basis of living cells.

   Scientists have had little success in demonstrating a plausible
   chemical reaction that could have formed peptides on Earth before life
   existed—the so-called pre-biotic period. In the absence of a plausible
   chemical reaction, scientists say life could not have evolved via
   chemical means.

   Reporting in tomorrow's issue of the journal Science, Ghadiri and his
   colleagues demonstrate that a simple volcanic gas, carbonyl sulfide
   (COS), helps free-floating amino acids to form peptides.

   According to Ghadiri, this reaction occurs under a variety of
   conditions that may have been present on Earth before life evolved.
   Metal ions, such as iron and lead, and other chemicals intensified the
   reaction.

   "Because there are several ways to do it, it bodes well for pre-biotic
   conditions," Ghadiri said.

   Norman Pace, a molecular biologist and expert on early life at the
   University of Colorado at Boulder, said the finding is of little
   surprise.

   "All kinds of organic chemistry goes on in volcanic exudates
   [openings]. Put that volcano on the seafloor [where most volcanism is]
   and things get even more complex and little explored," he said.

   Volcanic Life Origin?

   Ghadiri and colleagues Luke Leman, also at Scripps Research Institute,
   and Leslie Orgel of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San
   Diego, California, embarked on this study as an inquiry to life's
   origins. Their discovery could be a missing link.

Cassini Probe to Fly by Saturn's Moon Titan Tuesday

   John Roach
   for National Geographic News
   October 22, 2004

   The Cassini spacecraft is set to buzz through the upper atmosphere of
   Saturn's moon Titan on Tuesday. If all goes according to plan, the
   probe will use high-tech cameras during the flyby to peer through
   Titan's hazy orange atmosphere and peek at the moon's mysterious
   surface.

   "This is the first good look at Titan," said Dennis Matson, project
   scientist for the Cassini-Huygens Mission to Saturn and Titan at NASA's
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

   Titan has long intrigued scientists. Its surface and atmosphere are
   thought to resemble that of Earth several billion years before life as
   we know it began pumping oxygen into the atmosphere.

   Cassini came within 210,600 miles (339,000 kilometers) of Titan on July
   2, days after it entered orbit around Saturn. The spacecraft will fly
   by Titan at an altitude of 746 miles (1,200 kilometers) on Tuesday, the
   first of more than 40 planned close encounters.

   Scientists say that at such an altitude, the moon would appear as a
   featureless, fuzzy, beige ball to the naked eye, given the celestial
   body's hazy upper atmosphere and uniform cloud cover.

   "However, Cassini is equipped with a suite of instruments that will
   allow us to peer through the atmosphere and reveal the surface," said
   Carl Murray, a member of the Cassini imaging team and professor of
   mathematics and astronomy at Queen Mary University of London in
   England.

   The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint project of NASA and the European
   Space Agency.

   Images taken during the spacecraft's flyby will enable scientists to
   begin answering questions about Titan's surface, atmosphere, and
   chemical composition.

   Does the moon have oceans and lakes of liquid methane? Is Titan covered
   with mountains of ice? Is the moon pockmarked with impact craters?
   Cassini-Huygens's July 2004 flyby only hinted at answers to such
   questions.

   "At this point, it is way too early to tell what features we are seeing
   on the surface. But it doesn't look simply like a cratered surface,"
   said Elizabeth Turtle, a planetary scientist at the University of
   Arizona in Tucson.

Natl Geographic Film Fest Gives Voice to Unsung Cultures

   Stefan Lovgren in Los Angeles
   for National Geographic News
   October 28, 2004

   Mamdooh Afdile was tired of seeing movies that portrayed Arabs as
   either terrorists or politically correct sidekicks.

   So the 26-year-old Israeli Arab and first-time director borrowed U.S.
   $4,000 to make El-Zahme. The 14-minute film is about two brothers who
   find themselves reconsidering their relationship when the younger
   brother decides to abandon the mentally disabled older brother.

   "I'm trying to give people another perception of Arab characters than
   the ones they see on the news," Afdile said. "I want to show Arabs as
   real human beings, as complex people that make mistakes like everyone
   else."

   Afdile's film is part of the first National Geographic All Roads Film
   Festival, which is designed to showcase indigenous and
   under-represented minority filmmakers from around the world.

   The three-day festival, which starts today at National Geographic
   Society headquarters in Washington, D.C., also includes feature films,
   documentaries, music videos and animation, as well as live music and
   indigenous-art exhibits.

   "The festival is critical in the current age of global conflict and
   mistrust," said Mark Bauman, a National Geographic Society staff person
   who directs the festival. "It is important to create venues that allow
   all of us to hear each other's stories."

   Language Loss

   More than 300 films from 16 countries were submitted, including works
   from Brazil, South Africa, Iran, Israel, Mexico, Peru, South Africa,
   Thailand, and the United States.

   "I was amazed at the quality of the material," Bauman said. "There are
   a spectacular number stories out there to be told."

   Bauman says that thousands of languages have disappeared over the last
   few decades, taking with them not only vast bodies of scientific
   knowledge but also traditional stories that may never be heard again.

   "We want to create demand around storytelling in indigenous and
   minority communities so that these stories don't die," he said.

U2 launches colour iPod

   Paint it black: a front and back view of the U2 iPod, with the band's
   autographs on the rear.

   Apple Computer Inc has introduced a new larger-capacity iPod with a
   colour display as well as a first-of-its-kind digital compendium of the
   rock band U2's songs.

   U2's lead singer Bono and guitarist The Edge joined Apple chief
   executive Steve Jobs on stage in a newly renovated 1920s era theatre in
   San Jose to unveil the new products.

   Apple's latest effort to maintain supremacy in the portable audio
   player market and the online music business also includes a new special
   edition U2 iPod.

   Analysts expect the Apple-U2 partnerships to be the first of many to
   come between artists and music product providers.

   The digital album set will be available for $US149 ($200) at the iTunes
   online music store in late November. A digital boxed set, it brings
   together  400 U2 tracks from the band’s career -  including every U2
   album and  over 25 rare and unreleased tracks.

   The new iPod Photo has a colour screen that can display photos and
   slide shows accompanied by music. The 60-gigabyte model can hold 25,000
   photos, costs $US599 ($800), and is available now. A 40-gigabyte model
   costs $US499 ($670).

   The special edition U2 iPod is a 20-gigabyte iPod that's encased in
   black with a red click wheel instead of being all white. It will cost
   $US349 ($470) and will be available in November.

   U2 was among the first artists to endorse Apple when it introduced the
   groundbreaking iTunes store that helped jumpstart the legal music
   download market.

   "We see it as a next step for us and the music industry," The Edge
   said.

   Apple has continually introduced new features and slimmer iPod models
   with a longer battery life. It introduced the diminutive 4-gigabyte
   iPod Mini in January for $US249 ($335) and unveiled the
   fourth-generation, 20 and 40-gigabyte models of the iPod in July,
   lowering their respective prices by $US100 ($135) to $US299 ($400) and
   $US399 ($540).
   Susan Kevorkian, an analyst at market research firm IDC says to sustain
   its market lead, "Apple is going to have to keep innovating at the same
   price point, or introduce other products that are less expensive, and
   offering a flash-based player will be an easy way to do it."

   In the past month, five companies have unveiled their latest iPod
   challengers - portable music players with hard disks that can store
   anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 songs.
   There's Dell Inc's new Pocket DJ, Virgin Electronics' Player, Creative
   Labs Inc's Zen Micro, iRiver America Inc's H300, and Archos Inc's Gmini
   XS200.
   "Everyone is trying to get a bite out of Apple's piece of the pie,"
   said Kevorkian.

   The new colour iPod.

   Analysts say Apple could continue to dominate but expect that its
   market share will erode amid the slew of new arrivals that are matching
   the iPod's storage capacity, nearing it in style and ease of use,
   adding extra features like an FM tuner or voice recorder and, in some
   cases, undercutting Apple in price.
   The competition also includes players introduced earlier this year from
   Samsung Electronics Co, Sony Corp, and MP3 player pioneer, Rio Audio.
   But Apple always has more tricks up its sleeves.

   bears the image of the Virgin Mary.

   The eBay auction of a cheese sandwich said to bear the image of the
   Virgin Mary has drawn cheesy spoofs, including victuals meant to
   resemble the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
   Minister Ariel Sharon.

   Owner Diana Duyser, 52, of Hollywood, Florida, insists that what looks
   like a face on the grilled sandwich she kept by her bedside for the
   past 10 years "is the Virgin Mary, Mother of God" and that the sacred
   snack is miraculously mould-free.

   But the legions of Mary-sandwich spoofers evidently do not have much
   faith in her claim.

   Dozens of items inspired by the apparitional sandwich were listed on
   the eBay internet auction house today.

   Among the most unorthodox offerings were an "Ariel Sharon pork chop",
   "Yasser Arafat on a falafel" and a "George W Bush tortilla".

   There was also the "Virgin Mary's used gum in grilled cheese", the
   "Virgin Mary condom" and, from the junk-food-loving icon himself, the
   "Elvis - NOT Virgin Mary - better grilled cheese sandwich."

   Some listings were more serious but simply included the words "not
   Virgin Mary grilled cheese" in their description to draw internet users
   searching for Duyser's real thing, item number 5535890757.

   Others capitalised more directly on the sudden fame of the iconic
   listing, peddling items such as the "I ate the Virgin Mary grilled
   cheese. It was sacridelicious" T-shirt, and sliced cheese to make fresh
   Virgin Mary sandwiches.

   Some of the bidders also appeared to take the allegedly miraculous
   offering lightly, particularly the one who placed the highest bid
   allowed by eBay, for $US99,999,999 ($A129.58 million).

   EBay is allowing Duyser to screen bidders to help her weed out the
   hoaxers.

   The auction house itself had initially described the snack sale as a
   joke and cancelled bids, which had reached $US22,000 ($A28,508).

   But amid widespread media attention, eBay reversed its decision,
   allowing Duyser's sandwich to go back on sale Tuesday.

   The listing has a picture of a sandwich bearing what appears to be the
   image of a woman's face and a message from Duyser.

   "I made this sandwich 10 years ago. When I took a bite out of it, I saw
   a face looking up at me; it was Virgin Mary starring (sic) back at me.
   I was in total shock; I would like to point out there is no mould or
   (disintegration)," Duyser said.

   She said the sandwich, preserved in a plastic box, has brought her
   "blessings."

   "I have won $US70,000 ($A90,700) (total) on different occasions at the
   casino nearby my house; I can show the receipts (sic) to the high
   bidder," Duyser said.

Magnetic Beaks Help Birds Navigate, Study Says

   James Owen
   for National Geographic News
   November 24, 2004

   No wonder homing pigeons seldom get lost: They may get directions from
   their beaks. This intriguing idea is raised by a new study on the
   navigational abilities of birds published in tomorrow's issue of the
   science journal Nature.

   The study raises the possibility that homing pigeons use a magnetic

   Researchers say their study proves for the first time that homing
   pigeons can sense Earth's magnetic field.

   The findings add to the debate over whether pigeons and other birds
   chart their flight paths by using a magnetic sense or by following
   scent clues in the atmosphere.

   "The question of how [pigeons] might find their way home has fascinated
   laymen and academics for several decades," said Cordula Mora, a
   biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

   Descended from wild rock doves, homing pigeons can locate their lofts,
   or roosts, even when released several thousand miles away. Because of
   this ability, people have used the birds to carry messages since the
   days of ancient Egypt.

   "We know that pigeons have a magnetic 'compass' and a sun compass. But
   there has been a long debate over the nature of the 'map' that pigeons
   use in conjunction with these compasses," said Mora, the lead author of
   the study. "The two main theories are that pigeons smell their way home
   using an olfactory map, or that they have a magnetic map."

   Seeking to test the magnetic-map theory, Mora and her colleagues placed
   the birds in a wooden tunnel outfitted with feeding platforms at
   opposite ends and magnetic coils on the exterior.

   The researchers then trained the pigeons to fly to one feeder if the
   magnetic field inside the tunnel was undisturbed and to the second
   feeder if the coils were switched on.

   Small Magnets

   The researchers found that the birds' ability to select the correct
   feeder was significantly impaired if the birds had small magnets
   attached to their beaks. The scientists suggest this is because
   magnetite, an iron-rich crystal with magnetic properties, is found
   inside the homing pigeons' beaks.

Sea-Level Rise Gives Clue to Big Chill

   John Roach
   for National Geographic News
   December 6, 2004

   Many scientists believe that about 8,200 years ago a glacial lake more
   than twice the size of the Caspian Sea poured into the North Atlantic
   and triggered a precipitous drop in temperature just as Earth was
   exiting the last ice age.

   Climate modelers are keenly interested in accurately re-creating the
   conditions that drove this big chill, known as the 8.2 ka event, so
   they can predict if and when a similar scenario might occur in the
   future.

   "One thing they would like to get a better constrain on is exactly how
   much freshwater drained into the North Atlantic," said Torbjörn
   Törnqvist, an assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences
   at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

   Reporting in the December 11 online issue of the science journal
   Geophysical Research Letters, Törnqvist and his colleagues present
   evidence that the influx of water rose sea level no more than 4 feet
   (1.2 meters).

   By converting the sea-level rise to a measurable amount of freshwater,
   the researchers will get an idea by how much water was involved in the
   8.2 ka event. This finding indicates the amount of water was less than
   several previous studies suggested.

   "What meltwater does is it totally messes up ocean circulation,"
   Törnqvist said. "Freshwater suddenly released into the North Atlantic
   basically reduces the salinity of the ocean water [and] salinity plays
   an important role in driving ocean circulation."

   The North Atlantic climate is driven by a giant ocean conveyor belt
   known as the thermohaline circulation. It carries warm, salty surface
   water from southern latitudes to the north where it cools, which makes
   it denser. The dense, cool water sinks to the deep ocean and is
   exported south.

   The addition of freshwater to the system in the North Atlantic lowers
   the density of the water, counteracting the cooling process that
   increases density. A weakening of the circulation can lead to a drastic
   cooling of northern regions because less warm water is brought north,
   according to Törnqvist.

   Scientists believe a sudden influx of freshwater from North America's
   ancient Lake Agassiz to the North Atlantic weakened the thermohaline
   circulation 8,200 years ago and triggered a cooling of the region by up
   to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (about 6 degrees Celsius).

   Hans Renssen, a climate modeler at the Free University in Amsterdam,
   The Netherlands, said "a crucial thing that we don't know very well is
   how sensitive the thermohaline circulation is to freshwater
   perturbations, as different climate models give different responses."

   He and his colleagues use the 8.2 ka event as a test case of the
   circulation's sensitivity. "For such a test case, it is important to
   constrain the amount of freshwater as precisely as possible."

   Editor's note: a Korean translation of this article, courtesy of
   Netsecure Technology, is available here as a PDF document. Other
   requests for translation can be sent to the editors.

   This article is intended to outline useful ways of detecting hidden
   modifications to a Linux kernel. Often known as a rootkit, this
   stealthy type of malware gets installed in the kernel of an operating
   system and requires special techniques by Incident handlers and Linux
   system administrators to be detected.

   In this article we will make use of just one tool, gdb, the GNU
   debugger, to detect whether a Linux operating system has been
   compromised. The package that includes this tool can be found in almost
   every Linux distribution by default. The second goal of this paper is a
   presentation of an intruder's popular methods of "patching" the kernel
   of a Linux operating system. By understanding the attack vector, we can
   easily detect that our machine has been compromised or select the right
   tools to monitor our critical machines.

   This focus on detecting kernel modifications is important because it is
   the most stealthy of all methods for an intruder to install malicious
   code in an operating system. Once this malicious code is in place,
   intruders can defeat most commercial and free host intrusion detection
   systems (IDSs) which monitor the integrity of the operating system's
   files.

Introducing the threat of rootkits

   More and more user-mode malicious programs, such as Trojan horses,
   backdoors or rootkits, modify existing operating system software. To
   install one of these tools on a victim's machine, an attacker must
   replace or modify the normal programs that are associated with the
   operating system. For example, let's consider a replacement of the
   ubiquitous ls command. Normal users and administrators use the ls
   command to list the contents of a directory, but a modified version of
   ls will hide the attacker's files. Tools which can detect this kind of
   modification are called file integrity checkers.

   Let's suppose that an attacker doesn't replace or modify any existing
   programs, such as ls, on the file system. Instead, suppose the attacker
   replaces or modifies various components of the kernel. We know that
   many user-mode programs, such as ps, ls or lsof, use the kernel to
   perform some of their tasks. For example, when an administrator runs
   the ls command to list the contents of a directory, the sys_getdents
   kernel-level system call is invoked. An attacker can therefore modify
   this kernel component to hide some files or processes.

   Now, let's consider the another example where an attacker modifies both
   the sys_open and the sys_read system calls to block access to a set of
   selected files. These same system calls are usually used by file
   integrity checkers to verify the integrity of important system files,
   like the kernel image or loadable kernel modules. When these tools try
   to compare the hashes of files to their previous values, they will
   remain the same even when these files have, in fact, been modified. In
   other words, critical files could be shown to be intact by file
   integrity checkers when they are not, just by hooking two system calls.
   It should be quite obvious, then, that when kernel components are
   modified by an attacker, users and administrators cannot trust any of
   the results received from the kernel or from any security related tools
   that run as a user.

   Linux kernel-mode rootkits, or other kinds of malicious code, are
   installed directly in a memory area reserved for the kernel code and
   they are really powerful. They modify kernel structures in order to
   filter data which will be hidden from system administrators. To filter
   this data it is necessary to take control over some kernel components
   like system calls, interrupt handlers, internal functions of the
   netfilter, and more. It is easy to imagine several places in the kernel
   of an operating system where such control can be manipulated. At this
   point, it is now important to understand some of the most popular
   attack vectors.

Understanding the attack vector

   The most common targets of a compromise are system calls. This vector
   is chosen by intruders for two reasons: because it is the easiest way
   to take control over a compromised machine, and also because system
   calls are very powerful. System calls are basic functions used by an
   operating system. For example, they are used to read and write data to
   and from files, they are used to get an access to various devices, to
   run executables, and so on.

   There are about 230 system calls in the current stable version of the
   Linux kernel, 2.4.27, and about 290 system calls in the Linux kernel
   2.6.9. Note that the number of system calls changes depending on the
   version of the kernel. The full list of system calls in your kernel is
   always available in the file /usr/include/asm/unistd.h. It should be
   also noted that not all system functions are normally modified by
   intruders -- however, there are a few very popular ones. These system
   calls are presented below, in the Table 1. They should be closely
   monitored by administrators and, of course, by host intrusion detection
   systems. The full description of each system call can be found in the
   system manual (2) -- "Linux Programmer's Manual" for those who are
   interested in further details.

     Table 1. Important Linux system calls, their description, and their
                              system call IDs.

   For the above table, note that the ID is the number of an entry in the
   system call table. For the purposes of this article, the IDs are used
   for Linux kernel 2.4.18-3.

   While all of the examples presented in this article were tested on the
   Red Hat 7.3 with kernel 2.4.18-3, similar steps can be done during an
   investigation of other versions, including the latest Linux kernel
   2.6.x. Some differences can appear in internal structures of the Linux
   kernel 2.6.x, however. For example, the address of system call table is
   kept inside of the function syscall_call instead of system call handler
   named system_call .

Modifiying the system call table

   Current addresses of system calls are kept in the system call table, in
   a memory area reserved for the kernel of an operating system. Addresses
   there are kept in the same order as their functions, and are presented
   in the /usr/include/asm/unistd.h file. System calls are identified by
   the number of the entry (ID) in the system call table, as we saw in the
   table above.

   Let's start with an example. When the sys_write system call is invoked,
   its ID of 4 is placed into the eax register and a software interrupt is
   generated (int 0x80). There is a special interrupt handler which keeps
   this address in its interrupt descriptor table and is responsible for
   handling the interrupt (again, int 0x80). Next, the system call handler
   system_call is invoked. This handler can locate the direct address of
   the requested system call by knowing the address of the system call
   table and the ID of the system call (which is kept by the eax
   register). There is also a longer way to invoke this system call
   handler, but I have omitted some details to simplify this article.

   The first method an intruder uses when taking control over a desired
   system call is to overwrite the address of the original system call in
   the system call table. When the system call is requested, the handler
   calls a replacement function. We can easily watch these addresses, kept
   in the system call table, by using the gdb tool. That is why gdb is so
   useful for detecting this kind of malware.

   Of course, another problem arises. We have to be sure that the current
   addresses in the system call table are not modified -- that we are not
   already compromised. How can we verify this? The addresses of system
   calls are always permanent and do not change after a reboot of the
   operating system. These addresses are set during kernel compilation, so
   knowing the original addresses we can compare them to addresses
   currently placed in the system call table. This information on the
   original addresses is written into two files on the file system during
   compilation time. The first one is the System.map file. This file
   contains the names of symbols and their corresponding addresses. The
   second file is the kernel image which is loaded into a kernel memory
   during system initialization. An uncompressed version of the kernel
   image is presented as the vmlinux-2.4.x file, and is usually placed in
   the /boot directory, or in a build directory defined before the kernel
   compilation.

   Sometimes only a compressed version of the kernel may be available
   (named vmlinuz-2.4.x). In this case, before starting our investigation
   we have to uncompress that kernel image. If an intruder hasn't modified
   these files (the compressed/uncompressed kernel image and the
   System.map), or if we had a trusted copy of these files, we can compare
   the original addresses to addresses which are currently kept by the
   system call table. It should need not be mentioned that we should copy
   these critical files or at least create a hash value from each of them
   immediately after a kernel compilation.

   We could also use a simple loadable kernel module, presented in the
   references section of this article, to print virtual addresses of each
   system call. To do this we compile the source code as follows: gcc -c
   scprint.c -I/usr/src/linux/include/. After the loading of the compiled
   module (the scprint.o object), addresses of each system call are
   written automatically to the syslog file. From time to time, we should
   run this module to compare original addresses to the current state of
   the kernel.

   In most cases, the kernel is modified by rootkits after a system
   initialization. It is done by loading a malicious kernel module or by
   an injecting some malicious code directly into the /dev/kmem object.
   Rootkits usually do not modify the kernel image or the System.map file.
   Therefore, to detect any modification of entries in the system call
   table we have to print all addresses, currently stored by the system
   call table, and then compare the result to the addresses kept in the
   kernel image (in our case, vmlinux-2.4.x). The memory of the operating
   system is represented by the object kcore which can be found in the
   /proc virtual file system.

   The first step is to find an address of the system call table. This
   should be an easy task, as shown below, because the symbol
   sys_call_table is presented in the System.map file:
[root@rh8 boot]# cat System.map-2.4.18-13 | grep sys_call_table c0302c30 D sys_
call_table

   Now, using the nm command, we can find an address of the system call
   table. This command allows us to print all symbols from the kernel
   image that has not been stripped:
[root@rh8 boot]# nm vmlinux-2.4.18-13 | grep sys_call_table c0302c30 D sys_call
_table

   Using the gdb tool, we can print the entire contents of the system call
   table from the kernel image, as shown in the listing below. Printed
   addresses correspond to system calls as defined in the entry.S file in
   the source files of the kernel. For example, the entry 0 (0xc01261a0)
   is the sys_ni_syscall system call, entry 1 (0xc011e1d0) is the sys_exit
   system call, entry 2 (0xc01078a0) is the sys_fork system call, and so
   on.
#gdb /boot/vmlinux-2.4.*  (gdb) x/255 0xc0302c30 0xc0302c30 :     0xc01261a0 0x
c011e1d0 0xc01078a0 0xc013fb70  0xc0302c40 : 0xc013fcb0 0xc013f0e0 0xc013f230 0
xc011e5b0  0xc0302c50 : 0xc013f180 0xc014cb10 0xc014c670 0xc0107940  0xc0302c60
 : 0xc013e620 0xc011f020 0xc014bcd0 0xc013e9a0  ...

   We can also print the address of each system call by providing its
   name, as shown below:
(gdb) x/x sys_ni_syscall  0xc01261a0 :     0xffffdab8  ((gdb) x/x sys_fork  0xc
01078a0 :   0x8b10ec83

   Now, by using the gdb tool (or the module we compiled, scprint.o), we
   must dump the current entries from the system call table. Finally, we
   compare the result to values received from the kernel image or the
   values received after kernel compilation.

   To print out the current state of the kernel, we must run the gdb tool
   with two parameters. The first one is the image of the kernel
   (vmliux-2.4.x), and the second is the object /proc/kcore. Then we use
   the address of the system call table, received from the System.map
   file, to print the entries of the system call table.
#gdb /boot/vmlinux-2.4.* /proc/kcore  (gdb) x/255x 0xc0302c30  0xc0302c30 :
 0xc01261a0    0xc011e1d0    0xc01078a0    0xc88ab11a  0xc0302c40 : 0xc013fcb0
   0xc013f0e0    0xc013f230    0xc011e5b0  0xc0302c50 : 0xc013f180    0xc014cb1
0    0xc014c670    0xc0107940  0xc0302c60 : 0xc013e620    0xc011f020    0xc014b
cd0    0xc013e9a0  ...

   As we can see from the above output, one of the addresses of the system
   call has indeed been changed. This is entry number 3 in the system call
   table (counting entries from 0), and is bolded in the above output for
   clarity. In the /usr/include/asm/unistd.h file we can find the name of
   this suspicious system call, which we determine to be sys_read.

   The another sign of a system compromise is that the new virtual address
   of this function (sys_read) is above 0xc8xxxxxx. It is, by nature,
   quite suspicious. A Linux operating system by default can address up to
   4 GB. Virtual addresses range from 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff in
   hexadecimal notation. An upper part of this virtual memory area is
   reserved for kernel code (their values range from 0xc0000000 to
   0xffffffff). When a new loadable kernel module is loaded, the vmalloc
   function allocates a part of this memory for the code of the module. It
   allocates a memory region -- usually starting from 0xc8800000. So,
   whenever the reference to the address of the system call is above this
   address, as we saw in this example, it indicates that our kernel could
   be compromised. At this point, it becomes necessary to look closer at
   this system call.

System call hooking

   Now we will examine a method of detecting system call hooking. None of
   entries in the system call table are modified with this method.
   Instead, the first few instructions of the original function are
   overwritten with a jump to a replacement function (called a detour
   function). Let's imagine that an intruder wants to hook the sys_read
   system call. He must first load the replacement function into memory
   and then place the address of this function in the first few bites of
   the original function. In doing so, the intruder must redirect an
   execution flow of the original function to the replacement one.
   Assembly instructions, like call or jmp, are usually used.

   To detect whether any system call has been hooked, we must print out
   all the instructions of the target function. We start by running the
   gdb tool with two parameters (the kernel image and the /proc/kcore
   object). Next, we must disassemble the original function by using the
   disass command inside the gdb tool, as shown below.
#gdb /boot/vmlinux-2.4.* /proc/kcore  (gdb) disass sys_read  Dump of assembler
code for function sys_read:  0xc013fb70 :               mov     $0xc88ab0a6,%ec
x  0xc013fb73 :               jmp     *%ecx  0xc013fb77 :               mov
 %esi,0x1c(%esp,1)  0xc013fb7b :              mov     %edi,0x20(%esp,1)  0xc013
fb7f :              mov     $0xfffffff7,%edi  ...

   From the above output, we can see that the first instruction moves the
   value (the address of the replacement function) to the ecx register.
   The second instruction does an indirect jump to this virtual address -
   0xc88ab0a6.

   To make sure that the sys_read system call was hooked, we must
   disassemble the original function. The original function is presented
   in the kernel image vmlinux-2.4.x.
#gdb /boot/vmlinx-2.4.*  (gdb) disass sys_read  Dump of assembler code for func
tion sys_read:  0xc013fb70 :            sub     $0x28,%esp  0xc013fb73 :
       mov     0x2c(%esp,1),%eax  0xc013fb77 :              mov     %esi,0x1c(%
esp,1)  0xc013fb7b :             mov     %edi,0x20(%esp,1)  0xc013fb7f :
      mov     $0xfffffff7,%edi  ...

   The output confirms that the sys_read system call has indeed been
   modified. To investigate what this new function really does, we can
   disassemble the function by using the gdb tool.

A modification of the system call handler

   Using the method as described above, we can also disassemble other
   critical functions in the kernel memory. One of them is the system call
   handler, named system_call, that is used to locate and call requested
   system calls. The handler uses the system call table to find an address
   of the requested system call. By disassembling this handler, we can
   check if the right address of the system call table is used or if the
   handler is hooked. In an attack scenario, an intruder can create his
   own system call table using replacement system calls. Then, he can
   place a new address for the system call table in the system call
   handler.
 (gdb) disass system_call  Dump of assembler code for function system_call:  0x
c01090dc :        push    %eax  0xc01090dd :      cld  0xc01090de :      push
  %es  0xc01090df :      push    %ds  0xc01090e0 :      push    %eax  0xc01090e

ov     %edx,%ds  0xc01090ee :     mov     %edx,%es  0xc01090f0 :     mov     $0
xffffe000,%ebx  0xc01090f5 :     and     %esp,%ebx  0xc01090f7 :     testb   $0
x2,0x18(%ebx)  0xc01090fb :     jne     0xc010915c   0xc01090fd :     cmp     $
0x100,%eax  0xc0109102 :     jae     0xc0109189   0xc0109108 :     call    *0xc
0302c30 (,%eax,4)  0xc010910f :     mov     %eax,0x18(%esp,1)  0xc0109113 :
 nop  End of assembler dump.

   Please note that this disassembled handler contains the address of the
   original system call table.

Useful tools

   Of course, it would be even better to automate all tasks described in
   this article. One of the ways to use this is with host based intrusion
   detection systems which monitor critical kernel structures in real
   time. For example, the Samhain tool can be used. This tool was briefly
   described in a previous Infocus article, "Host Integrity Monitoring:
   Best Practices for Deployment". The Samhain tool is able to monitor the
   system call table, the first few instructions of every system call
   including some handlers, the interrupt description table, and much
   more.

   When considering an IDS to monitor the integrity of our kernel, we must
   remember one basic rule -- every kind of monitoring tool such as this
   must be installed on a clean install of the operating system, as this
   is the only way to know that we have not already been compromised. If
   we don't install any host based IDSes we should at least create a hash
   sum of the kernel image.

Summary

   As we have seen, the gdb tool can be very useful for detecting a
   kernel-level operating system compromise.

   The detection of a kernel level compromise can be very complicated
   without confirmation that at least one source of knowledge is trusted.
   In examples used in this article, the kernel image is the trusted
   source of knowledge.

   Detecting Rootkits And Kernel-level Compromises In Linux - Comment:01
   May 2012 : Link

   Every thing worked fine for me.

   I just want to know more about the syntax of System call table that we
   get as output after typing "x/255x $SystemCallTableAddress".

   Also when we type say 'x/x sys_mkdir' i get the output as :

   0xc1133a70 <sys_mkdir>:    0x83e58955

   what is  '0x83e58955' in the above output.

   Can you please explain?

   Regards

   Ovais

   [t.gif] Cassini takes a close-up look at Saturn's giant moon Titan
           [black.gif]

   By John Antczak
   ASSOCIATED PRESS

   7:05 p.m. October 26, 2004

                                                       [041026cassini.jpg]

     The international Cassini spacecraft began beaming close-up images of
     Saturn's moon Titan to Earth late Tuesday. This image taken on Sunday
      reveals Saturn's moon Titan's bright "continent-sized" area known as
                                                                   Xanadu.

   PASADENA – The international Cassini spacecraft began beaming close-up
   images of Saturn's moon Titan to Earth late Tuesday.

   Cassini reached the point of closest approach at 9:44 a.m. PDT and
   transmitted to NASA's deep space network antenna in Madrid, Spain about
   6:30 p.m. PDT.

   The first image was a low-resolution scene of a portion of Titan's disk
   covered in the now familiar hydrocarbon haze.

   "It takes a bit of processing to bring out features," imaging team
   leader Carolyn Porco.

   There was concern that bad weather in Spain might interfere with some
   of the night-long data transmission.

   Cassini turned its cameras and instruments toward the cloud-shrouded
   moon in the closest flyby since entering orbit around Saturn on June
   30. Scientists want to see whether Titan has oceans or seas of liquid
   methane and ethane.

   The Titan flyby was one of 45 planned for the Cassini mission. The
   spacecraft also carries a European Space Agency probe that will be
   released on Dec. 24 and plunge into Titan's atmosphere in January,
   radioing pictures and science data back to Cassini as it descends under
   a parachute.

   Titan, which is bigger than the planet Mercury, has an atmosphere 1½
   times as dense as Earth's and contains organic – meaning carbon-based –
   compounds.

   Scientists believe those compounds could be much like those on Earth
   billions of years ago before life began. Life, however, is unlikely on
   Titan because it is so cold, minus-289 degrees Fahrenheit.

   The $3.3 billion spacecraft's first flyby on July 2 was at a distance
   of some 200,000 miles and proved disappointing.

   Scientists struggled to discern surface features through what was
   described as an "organic goo," a hydrocarbon haze likened to smog over
   Los Angeles.

   This time, Cassini was programed to also use its imaging radar to
   generate topographical maps and determine whether Titan has a liquid or
   solid surface.

   Cassini was launched in 1997 and flew 2.2 billion miles on a roundabout
   route to Saturn. NASA said it has worked flawlessly since soaring
   through a gap in Saturn's shimmering rings to enter orbit.

   The mission was funded by NASA, the European Space Agency and the
   Italian Space Agency

   'San Andreas' poised for big sales, big debate
   By Mike Snider, USA TODAY
   Video gaming's most felonious franchise is back, and it's threatening
   to hijack the holidays. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the latest in a
   line that has sold 32 million games and sparked protests among
   anti-violence activists, arrives in stores this week. (Related story:
   New releases could herald 'the holiday of megagames')
   [clear.gif]
   [inside-grandtheftauto-sa.jpg] [clear.gif] On the fault line: Grand
   Theft Auto: San Andreas could bust a cap in the video-game competition.
   [clear.gif]
   RockStar Games

   The PlayStation 2 title already is the year's presumptive best seller.
   Analysts predict San Andreas could sell 5 million copies by year's end
   at $49.99 retail, planting it in Hollywood blockbuster territory.
   Eventually, 15 million copies could be sold, topping the all-time best
   seller: its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, with more than 13
   million sold.

   "San Andreas could well be the biggest-selling game ever," says John
   Davison, editorial director for Ziff Davis' video game magazine group.

   The Hollywood comparison carries over to casting and soundtrack. San
   Andreas, which plays like an urban gangster movie, boasts guest voices
   including Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Ice T and Peter Fonda. Car
   radios and boom boxes blast oldies from acts as diverse as the Ohio
   Players, Willie Nelson, James Brown, the late Tupac Shakur and Rage
   Against the Machine, spun by disc jockeys such as George Clinton, Axl
   Rose and Chuck D. (A double-CD soundtrack and an eight-CD box set are
   due Nov. 23.)

   In the game, main character CJ (voiced by rapper Young Maylay) returns
   to his hometown after his mother is killed, and he is drawn into gang
   rivalries in an odyssey that stretches over three cities and more than
   100 hours. Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, says
   the game might crowd out competitors: Consumers "will be playing this
   game for hours and hours."

   That leaves lots of room for content that drew fire from Congress and
   parent groups in past GTAs."You can still beat up hookers and steal
   their money, you can still run over cops and shoot and kill the
   ambulance drivers as they come in to pick up the dead people. All of
   the carnage and destruction is still intact," says Tom Ham of Play
   magazine. Hsu says San Andreas may draw even more heat because of
   gang-related violence.

   Rockstar Games notes that Andreas is rated M (for ages 17 and up) and
   that marketing is aimed at adults. "We make the games that we want to
   make and the games that we believe people want to play," the firm said
   in a statement.

   Teen boys no longer rule the realm: The average age of today's gamer is
   29, according to the Entertainment Software Association.

   A lot of ground to be covered before space tourism can fly
   By Traci Watson, USA TODAY
   When a privately built rocket plane soared into space earlier this
   month, astronaut wannabes were giddy with the hope that they'd finally
   make it off the planet.

   start a commercial space flight as early as 2007. [clear.gif]
   By Robert Galbraith, AP

   They'll have to wait. Despite the recent successful flights of the
   private craft known as SpaceShipOne, significant hurdles remain before
   an ordinary person can buy a ticket to leave Earth.

   Building a space tour bus, for example, will be tough. And coping with
   government regulations might be worse. Such work will take time, and
   many space experts think it's wildly optimistic to talk about flights
   in three years — which is when the world's first space tourism company
   wants to begin ferrying passengers.

   "Double it, triple it, and you're looking at a realistic time frame
   when you might go up," says Marco Caceres of Teal Group, an aerospace
   and defense consulting firm.

   For starters, there's still no vehicle that a tourist — even a rich one
   — could ride into space. The world's only private spacecraft is
   SpaceShipOne. It seats just three people, and its designer, Burt Rutan,
   has already said it won't be used for commercial flights.

   This month, SpaceShipOne won a $10 million reward called the Ansari X
   Prize by carrying a man into space twice within two weeks. The X Prize
   was offered by a non-profit group to foster the development of a
   private space industry.

   The prize has already accomplished its mission. Rutan plans to build
   five spacecraft for a new company founded by entrepreneur Richard
   Branson to offer trips into space. The new ships, to be based on
   SpaceShipOne, are supposed to ferry customers as early as 2007.

   Rutan's next vehicle, like his first, will be suborbital: It will dip
   into space for a few minutes rather than orbit the Earth. But just
   because Rutan has built one suborbital vehicle doesn't mean it will be
   easy to build another, experts say.

   "It's still a considerable technical challenge," says Dan Rasky of
   NASA's Ames Research Center.

   It took Rutan a year longer than he expected to build SpaceShipOne. And
   his "spaceliners" will have to carry three more people than the
   original ship.

   Making the task more difficult, Rutan has vowed to make the new ships
   100 times safer than any vehicle that has ever flown in space. That
   could be difficult, given the prototype's history. On SpaceShipOne's
   first spaceflight June 21, a control system failed. During a flight
   Sept. 29, it rolled rapidly 29 times as it shot toward space.
   [clear.gif]   Years in the making [clear.gif] [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]
   Engineers hope in the next three years to build the first privately
   developed spaceship to carry paying passengers. Development time for
   some other space vehicles:

   [bullet.gif] ;Mercury, the first U.S. manned vehicle to fly in space: 3
   years

   [bullet.gif] Apollo, which took astronauts to the moon: 7 years

   [bullet.gif] Space shuttle: 9 years

   [bullet.gif] SpaceShipOne, the first privately developed manned
   spaceship: 5 years

   Sources: Scaled Composites; NASA; Columbia Accident Investigation Board
   [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]

   Rutan himself acknowledges that he faces a monumental task.

   "We have a big challenge in front of us," he said recently, referring
   to the deadline for building Branson's spaceships. "We're going to be
   working very, very hard."

   There's also the chance that red tape could delay tourist launches.

   This month, language added in the Senate to a space-tourism bill said
   the industry "should be held to the highest standard of safety when
   transporting humans."

   Such wording could impose safety and licensing requirements similar to
   those faced by airlines. Space-tourism entrepreneurs say that could
   strangle their companies. But lawmakers have backed down and are trying
   to compromise.

   And there are questions about whether Branson will stay the course,
   especially if spacecraft development turns out to be trickier than
   expected. The founder of Virgin Airways and numerous other businesses,
   Branson is known for his promotional skills. But not every venture has
   been a success. The Belgium-based discount airline Branson started did
   poorly. He said a year ago that his new low-fare airline in the USA
   would start flying by mid-2004, but the airline is still in the
   planning stages.

   But if Branson or another mogul can overcome the technological and
   regulatory problems, there's money to be made.

   More than 7,500 people have asked for more information about Branson's
   spaceflights. And more than 100 people have put down 10% of a $100,000
   payment with Space Adventures, a company that connects would-be
   astronauts with companies building spaceships.

   The real question, space experts say, is whether a company can make a
   profit on space tourism.

   There's a "pretty good market," says Philip McAlister of the Futron
   aerospace research firm. "The question is, can someone service that
   demand at a price ... that will let them make money? That has yet to be
   determined."

   Branson seems confident. He has pledged to use the profits from his
   space-tourism outfit to do research so that people who don't have a
   fortune can fly into space.

Bush’s bold space policy

   By - The Washington Times - Saturday, October 30, 2004

   The election on Nov. 2 will have many far-reaching implications, not
   the least of which is mankind’s fledgling reach into space. Differences
   in space policy may not swing many voters, but the divergent visions of
   President Bush and Sen. John Kerry merit careful consideration.

   Mr. Kerry’s prospective space policy reflects a pre-Columbia mindset,
   reaching back to the days before the tragedy that claimed seven
   astronauts and disregarding the hard choices it necessitated. The loss
   of Columbia did more than reduce the shuttle fleet; it dictated either
   the retirement or re-certification of the remaining shuttles by 2010.
   Neither alternative is wise. The shuttles have never fulfilled their
   promise and their primary destination, the International Space Station
   (ISS), has proved a costly experimental platform.
   [INS: :INS]

   The bold alternative of exploration is almost an afterthought under Mr.
   Kerry’s plan. He supports human and robotic solar system exploration,
   “but only as one goal among several.” Instead, Mr. Kerry would return
   the manned space program to spinning in circles, as it has done for
   decades. “Two of NASA’s top priorities,” under Mr. Kerry, would be
   returning the shuttle to flight and completing the ISS, according to
   spokesman Jason Furman. Mr. Furman added that Mr. Kerry believes that
   the ISS should have a “much broader mission.”

   That mission is heavily weighted toward Earth. In an Oct. 25 one-page
   position paper, Mr. Kerry promises to “pursue a more balanced space and
   aeronautics program, one that assigns appropriate priority to all NASA
   programs.” The senator would effectively clip NASA’s wings by putting
   more emphasis on Earth science and aeronautics, including spending on a
   “secure air traffic management system.”

   Another of Mr. Kerry’s declared goals for space exploration is
   “ensuring that [it] is a global undertaking that unites all nations in
   a quest for understanding.” (Presumably, doing so will allow America to
   pass the global test.)

   Mr. Bush’s space vision encourages international involvement, too, but
   only as a part of a far grander purpose — our reach upward and outward.
   His post-Columbia space policy calls for a sustained human push into
   the solar system — and beyond. Mr. Bush puts the focus of the manned
   space program exactly where it should be: space exploration.

   Mr. Bush aims to permanently break the bonds of low-Earth orbit, making
   discoveries and developing infrastructure along the way. Benefits in
   the form of innovative solutions and technical spinoffs will be a
   consequence of that exploration, but they are not, per se, its primary
   object.

   Rather, as Mr. Bush declared in his memorial speech for the Columbia
   astronauts, “The cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we
   choose. It is a desire written in the human heart.”

   The contrasts are stark. A Kerry administration would delay — if not
   doom — America’s reach into space.

    NASA's Gravity Probe B spacecraft has begun its search for a bizarre
                    prediction of Einstein's relativity.

   September 2, 2004: It's "all systems go" for one of the most ambitious
   physics experiments ever attempted.

   see caption On August 27th, after four months in orbit, NASA's Gravity
   Probe B satellite began its year-long hunt for signs of a subtle
   space-time vortex around Earth predicted by Einstein's theory of
   relativity. The search isn't going to be easy, but for scientists
   involved, one of the hardest parts is already over: months of
   delicately starting up and checking out the satellite, when one wrong
   move could have ruined the experiment before it ever got started.

   Right: Gravity Probe B in Earth orbit. [More]

   "It's a long and tortuous story," says Francis Everitt, principal
   investigator for Gravity Probe B (GP-B) and a professor at Stanford
   University.

                                [newshat.gif]

   One of the key parts of GP-B is an onboard telescope that locks on to
   the star IM Pegasus, which serves as a fixed point of reference in the
   sky. Everitt and his colleagues had figured that pointing the telescope
   at that star would be quick and painless, taking only three days after
   the launch.

   Instead it took weeks.

   First, sunlight reflecting off floating dust particles confused the
   satellite's star-tracking sensors. These sensors use the locations of
   constellations to orient the spacecraft, and the tiny shining specs
   looked like stars. The dust eventually cleared, but then another
   problem arose: Cosmic radiation in the form of high-speed protons
   peppered the telescope's light sensor, causing false signals. Mission
   scientists had to tweak the satellite's software to ignore these
   pulses. And on it went like this for weeks; scientists would solve one
   problem only to encounter another.

   "Now it has become very routine, and we only take about a minute to
   acquire the star as we come up over the horizon," Everitt says. (The
   satellite loses sight of the guide star during each orbit because it
   passes behind the Earth, so it must reacquire the star as it comes back
   into sight.)

   see caption The purpose of the telescope and the guide star is to help
   scientists keep track of four spinning spheres, or gyros, onboard the
   satellite. These gyros, which will be listed in a forthcoming edition
   of the Guinness Book of World Records as the roundest objects ever
   manufactured, are the heart of the experiment. In the beginning, their
   spin axes are aligned with IM Pegasus. If space-time around Earth is
   really twisted, as Einstein says, the gyros will wobble, slowly
   drifting out of alignment with the distant star during GP-B's one-year
   mission.

   Above: A spinning spherical gyroscope in Earth orbit should wobble in
   the whirlpool shaped space-time around our planet. [More]

   "One of the things all of us were terribly worried about was getting
   some dirt in the gyro housings," Everitt says. The gyros float a
   near-perfect vacuum, and only a thousandth-of-an-inch gap separates the
   spheres from their casings.
   "The gyros were cleaned before they went up, but we gave this thing a
   tremendous vibration during launch. Wouldn't you expect a piece of dirt
   to come in through one of the pump-out ports, land right on one of the
   gyros and jam it?" he says. "That would be the end of that gyro."

   This time all the worrying was for nothing. "The gyros have all been as
   clean as a whistle," he says. They're suspended in their casings,
   aligned with the guide star, and spinning thousands of times per
   minute. "Amazing, delightful."

                                 see caption
       Above: Gravity Probe B mission control at Stanford University.

   Now the gathering of science data begins. The satellite's onboard
   computers should be able to handle this phase of the mission
   automatically. Still, at least one person will be on duty monitoring
   GP-B at all times throughout the year, Everitt says. "It should run
   itself, but you can never relax."

   After more than 40 years of methodical planning and four months of
   intense troubleshooting, GP-B's scientists feel "a real sense of
   gladness," he says. "What a difference it makes to be up there and
   operating. How thrilling that is. We all feel that."
   "Some people," laughs Everitt, "are talking about taking a week or two
   of well-deserved vacation."

Colleges turn to eBay to sell unwanted goods

When nothing else works, schools get a good price in online market

   Texas A&M University couldn't give away a fleet of 20-year-old buses,
   so it sold them â on eBay.

   With starting bids of $500 each, three buses went online for a weeklong
   auction. In the end, Texas A&M pulled in $5,900 and now wants to sell
   22 more buses.

   "It's cool. It far exceeded our posted expectations," said Paul Barzak,
   assistant director of the university's Department of Purchasing
   Services.

   Universities across the country are increasingly turning to eBay's
   online global market to sell surplus items, some of which might
   otherwise be junked.

   Last year, Penn State University earned about $90,000 on eBay,
   auctioning off more than 100 items, including wrestling mats, pianos
   and an ice cream machine. The school even sold a large globe for
   $11,600 to a museum in the Netherlands.

   "That money goes back to the departments and back into their budgets,"
   said Will Gallaher, manager of Penn State's salvage and surplus
   department. "Budgets are tight, so it helps."

   Other colleges using eBay include Oregon State, Michigan State and
   Washington State universities.

Universities must follow strict guidelines to sell

   Although the San Jose, Calif.-based company doesn't track how many
   colleges are among its 114 million registered users, eBay says its
   online market offers schools another option.

   "One of the beauties of eBay is that the advantages are the same
   regardless to what kind of entity you are," said Hani Durzy, an eBay
   spokesman. "Sellers play on the same rules, and individuals can compete
   on a global scale."

   Businesses, corporations and municipalities have been using the site
   for years, Durzy said. In Texas, Harris County and the city of Houston
   both use the Internet to sell surplus items.

   But not everything goes. Certain laws prevent colleges from selling
   hazardous and radioactive material. In Texas, state guidelines also
   dictate how colleges can get rid of surplus or obsolete items.

   First they need to make sure no other departments on campus can use
   them. If not, the items are offered to school districts. If there are
   still no takers, universities are then allowed to advertise in
   newspapers or send the items to a public auction, Barzak said.

   In those cases, eBay is another option before universities send
   equipment to the junkyard.

Online auction not for all schools' unused items

   Not all schools are successful, though. Some university officials say
   it is too costly to photograph all of their surplus items, post them
   online and keep up with the auction.

   And not all items will find an online buyer.

   The University of Texas tried to sell a 30-foot crane on eBay earlier
   this year but never got a bid, said Kenneth Limbrick, UT's manager of
   general services.

   "Not everyone needs a crane in their back yard," he said. The
   university sold the crane in a public auction in June.

   Although eBay didn't work for the crane, that's no reason to doubt the
   power of Internet-based sales, Limbrick said.

   "The universities have gotten the courage to step off into this," he
   said. "It was just our first venture into this arena."

   Texas A&M decided to sell its buses online after successfully
   auctioning Aggies softball-team jerseys to out-of-state fans and a few
   former players.

   When Bryan Cohen of College Station heard about A&M's online bus sale,
   he rushed to place a bid.

   The 22-year-old bar manager saw a lot of possibilities with a 35-foot
   bus, which he ended up getting with a bid of $1,525.

   He plans on refurbishing the vehicle with television sets, flashy
   lights, a paint job, leather seats and a booming sound system so that
   he can rent the bus to partygoers.

   Cohen said he couldn't believe his luck when he was listed as the final
   bidder on eBay.

   "I never thought it would happen," he said, "but I tried and it
   worked."

Gordon Cooper, Mercury astronaut, dies at 77

GORDON COOPER 1927-2004
One of the Mercury 7, 'Gordo' had Right Stuff
Early astronaut showed the moon was attainable

   Gordon Cooper Jr., one of the original seven astronauts who became
   national celebrities during the Cold War space race, died Monday at his
   home in Ventura, Calif. He was 77.

   Cooper, who piloted the last flight of NASA's Mercury program and later
   set a space endurance record during a Gemini mission, died of natural
   causes, said a spokesman for the Ventura County medical examiner.

   He had been suffering from heart problems and showed symptoms of heart
   failure on

   Saturday and Sunday, former Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra told the
   Associated Press.

   His death leaves just three living Mercury astronauts: Schirra, John
   Glenn and Scott Carpenter.

   NASA leaders described 'Gordo' Cooper as a space program pioneer whose
   achievements inspired others to continue to explore the universe. But
   Cooper's reputation for being brash overshadowed a man who Schirra
   called sincere and hard working.

   "He was not the hotshot flyboy that Dennis Quaid played in The Right
   Stuff," Schirra told Knight Ridder newspapers, referring to the 1983
   movie based on Tom Wolfe's book about the Mercury astronauts.

   Schirra said he and Cooper â like the rest of the Mercury group â
   forged a friendship that endured.

   "It was that kind of relationship â much better than a brother," he
   said. "The bonding we had ... is just unsurpassed, unbelievable."

Youngest astronaut

   Cooper was the youngest of the Mercury astronauts selected in April
   1959 as the United States tried to catch the Soviet Union in a race to
   space. The others were Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra, Alan Shepard, Gus
   Grissom, and Deke Slayton.

   Chris Kraft, a former Johnson Space Center flight director during the
   Mercury missions, described Cooper as brash and someone who "showed up
   on the scene ready to take on the world."

   "I felt like they were heroes and I was proud to be associated with
   them as flight director in the early days," said Kraft, of Clear Lake.
   "All of them were extremely confident young men, ready to put their
   lives on the line for the country and you have to admire them for
   that."

   In May 1963, Cooper piloted the Faith 7 spacecraft on a 22-orbit
   mission that concluded the Mercury project and logged more time in
   space than all five previous Mercury astronauts combined. During the
   34-hour mission he became the first astronaut to sleep in orbit.

   Two years later, he command the eight-day Gemini 5, with Charles Conrad
   Jr. as the pilot. During the mission, Cooper became the first person to
   make a second orbital flight and proved that astronauts could survive
   in space for a trip to the moon and back. The mission set a space
   endurance record, just short of 191 hours.

   Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth and a former U.S. senator,
   recalled that the onboard clock was not working properly for the Faith
   7 mission. Cooper relied on Glenn's voice for a manual countdown to
   fire rockets that would ensure landing in the right spot. "He followed
   my count and hit the button on 'zero.' It worked; he got back," Glenn
   said.

   "As one of the Mercury astronauts, Gordon Cooper was one of the faces
   of America's fledgling space program. He truly portrayed the right
   stuff, and he helped gain the backing and enthusiasm of the American
   public," said NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe, according to the
   agency's Web site.

   Kraft said he last saw Cooper in 1998, when he gave an emotional
   tribute to Shepard at the former astronaut's funeral.

   Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr. was born on March 6, 1927, in Shawnee, Okla. He
   served in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1945 and 1946, then attended the
   University of Hawaii, where he was commissioned a second lieutenant in
   the U.S. Army.

   In 1949, he was called into active duty and completed pilot testing in
   the U.S. Air Force. From 1950 to 1954, he was a fighter pilot in
   Germany. He earned a bachelor's degree at the Air Force Institute of
   Technology in 1956, then completed test pilot school at Edwards Air
   Force Base in California. He served as a test pilot there until he was
   selected a Mercury astronaut.

'I get cranky if I don't fly'

   He was a backup command pilot of Gemini 12, launched in November 1965
   and backup command pilot for Apollo 10, which flew in May 1969. He left
   NASA and retired from the Air Force as a colonel in 1970.

   He founded the Florida-based Gordon Cooper and Associates that same
   year and served as president of the consulting firm that specialized in
   technical projects, ranging from the aerospace industry to land and
   hotel development.

   According to NASA, Cooper continued to design and test new aircraft in
   Southern California, and told a reporter at 71 that "I get cranky if I
   don't fly at least three times a month."

   After divorcing his first wife, Cooper married Susan Taylor in 1972. He
   has four daughters from his first marriage and two daughters from the
   second.

   Testing has always been a critical part of IT and certainly has become
   a fundamental component of Linux adoption. One of the most critical
   core pieces of Linux testing got a significant upgrade this week,
   courtesy of the Open Source Development Lab (OSDL), with version 3.0.1
   of the Scalable Test Platform (STP).

   Written in Perl and licensed under the GPL , STP is an enterprise-grade
   test harness used by the OSDL for Linux kernel testing. It provides a
   set of test suites that allow for code-change validation in the Linux
   kernel, as well quantifies stability and automatically tracks
   performance.

   "The purpose of this tool is to automate installation, configuration
   and set-up test systems, run the tests and collect the data in an
   easily accessible and configurable format," according to the OSDL.

   STP played an important role in the development release of the recent
   2.6 kernel. More than 1,000 kernel tests per month were performed on
   the new kernel during its development phase, and subsequently the OSDL
   claims to have run over 10,000 additional tests on its production.

   "The STP was helpful to us in delivering a stable 2.6 kernel at the
   first release," said Andrew Morton, lead maintainer of the production
   of the Linux kernel, in a statement. "Any developer or organization
   working around the kernel will find this a useful tool."

   New functionality in the latest version includes multiple-repository,
   which permits patches for software beyond the kernel to be added and
   tested against. Test options that tests receive can now be viewed and
   entered in a Web interface using checkboxes and input fields.

   Also, a number of bug fixes have been made. The new version expands the
   feature set of the platform into a number of areas, with one of the
   aims being to help simulate the different workload impact of popular
   open source databases, including MySQL and PostgreSQL.

   According to Josh Berkus, a member of the PostgreSQL core team, STP has
   already been very helpful for the PostgreSQL open source database
   project.

   "It's already done something for us," Berkus told internetnews.com.
   "[OSDL's] testing and retesting has helped us to troubleshoot some
   query planner problems that affected people with large data
   warehouses."

   In Berkus' view, STP also plays a part in helping open source projects
   in general as a test bed for enterprise environments.

   "One of the particularly big issues for us and other projects is that,
   as a volunteer developer for an open source project, you generally
   don't have access to a multi-processor machine for testing," Berkus
   explained. "Prior to OSDL doing this, we really actually didn't have
   anywhere where we could test on a quad processor machine, for example.
   And as more and more people have started using PostgreSQL as a
   replacement for Oracle or Informix, it's become more important for us
   to know something about that end of computing."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is hoping to do to
   call centers and help desks what he has accomplished in the CRM space.

   The San Francisco-based firm debuted a new on-demand business model it
   calls Supportforce.com. The goal is to address the growing number of
   companies that are outsourcing their customer service divisions.

   "For more than five years, Salesforce.com has been executing on its
   vision -- what we call 'The End of Software,'" Benioff said at the
   launch event here. "With Supportforce.com, we are transforming contact
   centers and help desks the same way that salesforce.com transformed
   sales force automation."

   The concept of streamlining call centers is not new. Benioff's
   competitors Siebel , PeopleSoft and SAP have been doing it for some
   time, as well as up and coming firms like RightNow Technologies .

   But Salesforce.com may have the momentum needed to pull off such an
   endeavor. Some 80 percent of all companies will outsource at least one
   function by 2005, according to a recent report by IT analyst firm META
   Group. Benioff said his company currently serves more than 11,100
   customers and 168,000 subscribers, but did not estimate how many more
   it might gain or convert with Supportforce.com. In a statement, the
   company said it does not expect to "generate incremental revenue from
   Supportforce.com during fiscal 2005."

   The new software suite picks up where Salesforce.com's original model
   started five years ago: basic automation software over the Web and adds
   in its customer relationship software and key aspects of its "sforce"
   developer's tool kit for making Internet-based business apps. The new
   platform is the first new release out of Salesforce.com since the
   company went public this past June.

   With Supportforce.com, Salesforce.com said it can let companies manage
   and share customer service and support information whenever they need
   it through call centers, contact centers, help desks, virtual at-home
   agents, and other customer service operations.

   The new platform relies heavily on partner support. Benioff has signed
   up some of the largest ones he could find. Avaya , Cisco , Alcatel ,
   Aspect and Genesys (an Alcatel company) have all pledged support to
   help with the hosting and delivery. The combined companies make up over
   70 percent of the global contact center marketplace.

   In the software-as-service model, customers typically pay a flat
   monthly subscription fee to use applications as much as they want;
   access is via a Web interface. Their data resides in secure partitioned
   servers maintained by the vendor.

   Vendors provide software upgrades and enhancements at no extra charge,
   freeing customers from having to maintain applications and servers.
   Application service providers (ASPs), hosted applications, utility
   computing and software on-demand all refer to variations of the model.

   With Supportforce.com, the company said it offers a multi-channel Web
   services interface with customer support and help desk functionality,
   knowledge management capabilities, and Web self-service and performance
   metrics so that companies can manage and share customer information.

   On feature called "Custom Tabs" lets system administrators add in
   modules to manage activities such as contact center staffing and
   control data access between service, sales and other departments.

   The new platform also addresses the trend toward using voice over the
   Internet (VoIP) courtesy of its sforce Telephony API (STAPI) toolkit.
   The addition allows for features like autodialing, rules-based routing,
   screen-pops, and call scripting, which can help improve productivity.

   Because outsourcing is often done overseas, Salesforce.com designed its
   new platform to support 11 languages: Brazilian Portuguese, simplified
   Chinese, traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Italian,
   Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Swedish.

   Pricing for the entire salesforce.com suite of products, including
   Supportforce.com is $65 per-user-per-month for the Professional Edition
   and $125 per-user-per-month for the Enterprise Edition.

   Climate legacy of 'hockey stick'

   The IPCC's version showed temperature variation over 1,000 years

   Enlarge Image

   There are few more provocative symbols in the debate over global
   warming than the "hockey stick".

   The hockey stick was a term coined for a chart of temperature variation
   over the last 1,000 years, which suggested a recent sharp rise in
   temperature caused by human activities.

   The chart is relatively flat from the period AD 1000 to 1900,
   indicating that temperatures were relatively stable for this period of
   time. The flat part forms the stick's "shaft".

   But after 1900, temperatures appear to shoot up, forming the hockey
   stick's "blade".

   The temperature chart originates from two seminal research papers
   published in Nature in 1998 and Geophysical Research Letters in 1999 by
   Michael Mann of the University of Virginia, Ray Bradley of the
   University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Malcolm Hughes of the
   University of Arizona.

   Even if more data is added, I would be surprised if it changed the
   shape of that curve much

   Joyce Penner, University of Michigan

   The high-profile publication of the data led to the "hockey stick"
   being used as a key piece of supporting evidence in the third
   assessment report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001, which offered a stark warning to
   policymakers of the urgency for action on reducing greenhouse
   emissions.

   The authors drew on a variety of sources that give information on past
   climate to reconstruct their temperature patterns.

   These included tree rings, ice cores, coral, instrumental data and
   historical records.

   The data led the researchers to the inevitable conclusion that
   greenhouse gas emissions were the dominant factor influencing climate
   variability in the 20th Century, a standpoint that remains hotly
   contested by some scientists.

   Potent symbol

   Over the years, the chart has gradually become a potent symbol of man's
   impact on global climate in the post-industrial age.

   Ever since the publication of Mann, Bradley and Hughes' data, global
   warming sceptics have tried to chip away at this record. And in a
   recent article published by the National Center for Policy Analysis
   think tank one scientist even claimed that the hockey stick had been
   "broken".

   Professor David R. Legates of the University of Delaware claims flaws
   in the data and methods used to fashion the hockey stick mean it can no
   longer be viewed as valid.

   Ice core, Science
   The temperature record uses data from many sources including ice cores

   "There is an exaggeration of recent trends, suggesting that 1998 was
   the warmest year, and that the 1990s were the warmest decade of the
   millennium," Dr Legates told BBC News Online.

   "There is an underestimation of the uncertainty, because they did not
   take into account other errors associated with estimating large-scale
   trends and temperature from observational data."

   The central thrust of Legates' article is rejected by other climate
   scientists, who claim that the sudden upsurge in temperatures since
   1900 is all too real.

   "This isn't a scientific paper, it's absolutely awful," said Professor
   Phil Jones, director of the Climate Research Unit at the University of
   East Anglia in Norwich, UK.

   Professor Jones and Mann extended the 1,000-year temperature record
   back to AD 200 for a research paper published in 2003. But the sharp
   warming trend in the post-industrial age was still clear.

   Future warning

   Jones says that all the evidence points to temperatures rising by about
   two tenths of a degree C per decade for the foreseeable future.

   In an article in the publication Energy and Environment, Legates and
   fellow climate scientists Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas criticised
   Mann and Jones' chart for leaving out the so-called Medieval Warm
   Period (AD 800 to 1400) and the Little Ice Age (AD 1600 to 1850).

   But other researchers, such as Dr Joyce Penner of the University of
   Michigan said they were not convinced by the case they made.

   Some scientists believe that the timing of these cold and warm periods
   varied geographically over the globe in a considerable way.

   Alaskan scenery, USFWS
   Professor Jones wants to look for long-lived trees in areas such as
   Alaska

   There have been other criticisms. This year, David Chapman, Marshall
   Bartlett and Robert Harris criticised the decision to exclude borehole
   data from one version of the temperature chart devised by Mann and
   Gavin Schmidt.

   By measuring temperatures in holes drilled in the ground scientists can
   construct a pattern of underground temperature variation to calculate
   the extent to which Earth's climate has warmed or cooled over hundreds
   of years.

   But Professor Jones explains that there were valid reasons for
   excluding this data; namely that boreholes produce fewer data points to
   study than some of the other evidence included in the study.

   In addition, borehole data can be influenced by changes in vegetation
   at the surface, Jones explains:

   "If an area was forested in the 17th Century, then that surface is
   denuded, then that will go into the borehole and the signal will
   change."

   Ongoing search

   For Professor Jones, the priority now is obtaining as much data as he
   can to reduce the error bars in the chart.

   He is working to obtain so-called dendroclimatic, or tree-ring, data
   from long-lived trees in Russia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand,
   Tasmania and North America. He also wants to obtain more data from
   corals as well as documentary evidence from China and Japan.

   Dr Legates says he has preliminary calculations that indicate the
   uncertainty in Mann and Jones' record is probably twice as large as
   they indicate.

   This, he suggests, means that recent temperature trends do not show
   unprecedented global warming. Professor Legates adds that he plans to
   work on his analysis for publication in a scientific journal.

   But Joyce Penner thinks the signs are that the analysis behind the
   chart of temperature variation is sound:

   "Even if more data is added, I would be surprised if it changed the
   shape of that curve much. There is such a strong difference between
   pre-industrial behaviour and the growth during the last 100 years or
   so," she said.

   TV project aims to kick-start 3G

   The LGU 8110 mobile phone
   Is broadcast-quality video what 3G phones need?

   High-quality, affordable video delivered to mobile phones could be the
   kick-start 3G phones need.

   An ambitious project is under way to find a way to send TV broadcast
   signals to mobiles by 2010.

   Dubbed Instinct, (IP-based Networks, Services and Terminals for
   Converging Systems), the project is being led by west London's Brunel
   University.

   "It could be the teaser needed to get people to use 3G," said project
   co-ordinator Dr Thomas Owens.

   3G hiccups

   It potentially solves two problems that have long been on people's
   minds - how to bring together the internet and TV, and how to make 3G
   handsets attractive to users.

   Couple in a shop talking about mobile phones

   At the moment 3G has not delivered what was hoped for it and people are
   not using it anything like as much as the operators hoped,

   Dr Owens, Instinct Project Coordinator

   Third-generation mobile phone technology offers users a wide range of
   high speed mobile services.

   These include video calling and messaging, e-mail, games,
   photo-messaging and news and information services.

   "There's currently very little crossover between broadcast and the
   internet," said Dr Owens, Instinct Project Coordinator.

   "But Instinct will bring the two together with mobile communications,"
   he told BBC News Online.

   "At the moment 3G has not delivered what was hoped for it and people
   are not using it anything like as much as the operators hoped," he
   said.

   Some 50 channels of news, sports and weather information with
   high-quality video clips and easy to navigate portals on mobile phones
   could be just what consumers are waiting for, added Dr Owens.

   There is also potential for more specific local channels, with
   information on hotels, restaurants and cultural events.

   EU cash

   The technology will be much cheaper for end users because it is being
   delivered via a one-to-many broadcast signal rather than a one-to-one
   phone call.

   There is much work to be done, however.

   Creating a cellular broadcasting network would require lots of
   transmitters dotted around the country, an engineering headache.

   And with many people wanting to use such a service while on a train or
   car journey, there are also issues to be ironed out about how to
   deliver signals at high-speed without using up valuable battery power.

   The project will have £6.4 million of EU funding and bring together
   academic and industrial partners in the UK, France, Germany, Italy,
   Israel, Spain and Brazil.

   The EU is especially interested in the project because of its potential
   to increase take-up of digital public services among those without
   internet connections.

   For people unable to get internet access at home, there is potential
   for public services, such as benefit forms, being available to download
   to phones.

   Users would simply need a Bluetooth-enabled phone linked to a
   transmitter in their local post office to make use of such a service,
   said Dr Owens.

   Other potential uses include downloading TV programmes stored in a
   set-top box to mobiles, to watch at users' convenience while away from
   home.

   Video games find their political voice
   By David Reid
   BBC Click Online
   The net has been an essential organising tool for political activists
   for some time. But video games with thought-provoking or political
   messages have emerged as a way of making those who play them a little
   more aware.

   Italy's commercial capital, Milan, is a city steeped in history and
   wealth. It seems an unlikely place for a revolution.

   Screengrab of Molleindustria's MayDay virtual march
   Activists can create their own avatar and march online

   But venture down a side street off the tourist map and the Centro
   Sociale La Pergola can be found, a gathering point for a group of
   Milan's young radicals.

   Many of them are media professionals for whom the net has become an
   essential tool for political organisation.

   "It's because it's a many-to-many medium, whereas traditional politics
   is done one-to-many - from Gates to many, from Murdoch to many, from
   Berlusconi to many and so on," said Alex Foti, from political activist
   group ChainWorkers.

   "It is a way of harnessing the wisdom and vitality of the crowds," he
   explained to BBC's Click Online programme.

   "Social research has proved that groups, when confronted with
   well-defined problems, show a marked interest in them."

   The net allows the Centro to organise political demonstrations cheaply
   and easily.

   Online instead

   For activists who cannot take to the streets, the organisation's
   website, Molleindustria, or "soft industry", has offered them the
   virtual equivalent.

   There, they can take part in an online MayDay parade which allows
   people to add to the throng and stylise their own marching demonstrator
   in an avatar form.

   Screengrab of Molleindustria's Tamatipico game
   Employees have to be kept happy if you want them to work

   Molleindustria is best known for its video games.

   In line with its radical politics, the aim of its games is to highlight
   what its creators believe is most unfair about global capitalism and
   the modern labour market.

   Their online game, Tamatipico, gives players their very own employee
   whom they have to keep happy to maintain production.

   Fail to give your worker enough sleep or time in front of the TV and he
   calls in sick or goes on strike.

   But ultimately the boss has the upper hand: if you are unhappy with
   your worker's performance, you can fire him on the spot.

   "We don't think it's enough to simply change the graphics' look, or to
   change the characters in order to give a different message," games
   designer Paulo Pedercini explained.

   "The real meaning of a video, its ideology, is expressed mainly through
   the internal rules of the game, its structure and mechanisms."

   Sombre simplicity

   This approach is best illustrated by another group from Uruguay called
   Newsgaming.

   They have produced a Shockwave-based game called September 12th.

   In its frightening logic, players hunt down terrorists, but with clumsy
   missiles, collateral damage is impossible to avoid.

   Screengrab of Newsgaming's Madrid game
   Madrid has a sombre simplicity about it

   By contrast, their game Madrid, if it can be called a game, is sombre
   in its simplicity. The rules require players to click on the candles so
   they burn brighter.

   But like all remembrance, the flames eventually fade.

   The producers of these games are developing a sort of gaming
   counter-culture, seeing themselves as the latest in a line of political
   satirists playfully poking fun at passers-by or at those in power.

   One of the main targets of such games is the US because of the
   internationalisation of its culture and more recently the war against
   terrorism.

   But Americans themselves, indeed none other than the Republican Party,
   are using video games to score political points.

   The Republicans' version of space invaders is Tax Invaders. It depicts
   Republican President George W Bush as the only hope in the battle
   against high taxes.

   Video games are normally a form of escape, a way to tune out from the
   troubles of the world.

   However, the producers of this new breed of game have shown they can
   also act as an effective vehicle for political expression.

   Real sells 3m tracks at a loss

   Tunes from Real's shop only play on a few devices

   Media software firm RealNetworks says it sold more than three million
   tracks thanks to an aggressive three-week price promotion in the US.

   The company halved the cost of tracks to 49 cents in mid-August to try
   to tempt consumers away from Apple's iTunes music store.

   The discount offer has ended, but Real said it would continue to offer
   the top 10 tracks at the lower price.

   But the promotion has come at a price, eating into the company's
   finances.

   Cents and music

   Apple dominates the market for online music through its iTunes online
   store, accounting for about 70% of paid-for music downloads.

   It has sold more than 125 million tracks since its inception in April
   2003.

   In common with most online music sellers in the US, Apple typically
   sells individual songs for 99 cents.

   Real halved the price of its tunes to 49 cents on 17 August to coincide
   with the public launch of the firm's latest software, Harmony, which
   can download music directly to Apple's iPod music player.

   The gamble appears to have paid off, with Real saying it sold more than
   three million tracks from its US online store over the three-week
   promotion.

   Although the offer has ended, Real said it would continue to offer 10
   of the most popular songs on its website at the cheaper price, in a
   promotion with music magazine Rolling Stone.

   "The discount and the Harmony promotion has enabled us to take a
   leading position in the download segment of the market," said
   RealNetworks vice president Dan Sheeran.

   Real has admitted that it lost money on the promotion, saying it will
   widen its third quarter loss by one cent per share.

   Human genome hits halfway mark

   Chromosomes
   Human chromosomes: Cracking the human code has been a bit like painting
   a picture

   Four years after publishing a draft of the human genetic sequence,
   researchers have hit the halfway mark in producing the "gold standard"
   version.

   They have just published a detailed run-down of a 12th chromosome -
   known as chromosome five - which means there are just 12 left to
   complete.

   The bundle of DNA is the largest so far, with 923 recorded genes, of
   which 66 are involved in human disease.

   The chromosome, which was sequenced by US scientists, is detailed in
   Nature.

   It is the second of three chromosomes that the Department of Energy
   Joint Genome Institute (JGI) has finalised in collaboration with
   colleagues at the Stanford Human Genome Center (SHGC).

   Code breakers

   Cracking the human genetic make-up has been a bit like painting a
   picture. First comes a rough sketch followed by a slightly fuller
   version before, finally, the minute detail is added.

   When the draft version of the human genome was unveiled in June 2000,
   97% of the "book of life" had been read. Then, last year, scientists
   announced the decoding was almost 100% complete.

   Now, several institutions around the world have divided up the 24 human
   distinct chromosomes - the cellular structures into which DNA is wound
   - and are going through them with a fine-tooth comb for a final time,
   to fill gaps and correct errors.

   This extremely accurate sequence will be a powerful tool for scientists
   trying to understand human disease

   Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Energy

   They are, as it were, dotting the I's and crossing the T's and giving
   the whole sequence a thorough spell-check.

   "It is about getting everything in the right order," commented Dr Tim
   Hubbard, of the Human Genetics group at the Sanger Institute in
   Cambridge, UK.

   "In the draft version there were 100,000 gaps in the whole genome. It
   was a small percentage of the sequence, but it meant you were uncertain
   about the order of the pieces.

   "It is important for doing experiments to have the complete sequence -
   to have no gaps at all."

   Giant chromosome

   According to researchers at the JGI and SHGC, the landmark chromosome
   five is a genetic behemoth, containing key disease genes and a wealth
   of information about how humans evolved.

   "This extremely accurate sequence will be a powerful tool for
   scientists trying to understand human disease," said US Secretary of
   Energy, Spencer Abraham.

   THE DNA MOLECULE

   Graphic, BBC

   The double-stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical
   components called bases
   Adenine (A) bonds with thymine (T); cytosine(C) bonds with guanine (G)
   Groupings of these "letters" form the "code of life"; there are about
   2.9 billion base-pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct
   bundles, or chromosomes
   Written in the DNA are about 30,000 genes which human cells use as
   starting templates to make proteins; these sophisticated molecules
   build and maintain our bodies

   The giant chromosome is made up of 180.9 million "letters" - the A's,
   T's, G's and C's that group together to make up the genetic code.

   Of the 923 genes that sit on chromosome five, 66 are known to be linked
   to disease when they go wrong. Another 14 diseases seem to be connected
   to chromosome five genes, but they have not been linked to specific
   genes yet.

   Having a detailed picture of chromosome five will be an immense help to
   researchers investigating these illnesses.

   "It is very useful to have a base sequence which you can then compare
   individuals to," Dr Hubbard told BBC News Online.

   "Then you can look for key differences between people that do have the
   disease and people that don't have the disease."

   Another feature of chromosome five will pique the interest of
   scientists studying the difference between humans and chimpanzees.

   Despite great similarities between the genomes of the two species,
   there are some key structural variations.

   In particular, one large section of chromosome five is flipped
   backwards in humans compared with chimps.

   Such an inversion makes it impossible for the two chromosomes to pair
   up during reproduction, which could have driven a wedge between the
   evolving ancestral populations.

   'Junk' DNA

   It is not just the genes in chromosome five that the scientists are
   interested in. Volumes of genetic material lie in between the genes,
   which for a long time were dismissed as "junk" by researchers.

   But on closer inspection, it seems this judgement was premature. The
   fact that sequences of junk were conserved for hundreds of generations
   suggests they have a function worth holding on to.

   "Important genetic motifs gleaned from vast stretches of non-coding
   sequence have been found on chromosome five," said Eddy Rubin, JGI's
   director.

   "Comparative studies conducted by our scientists of the vast gene
   desert... have shown these regions, conserved across many mammals,
   actually have a powerful regulatory influence."

   Over the next few months, the remaining 12 human chromosomes should be
   completed to a final gold standard of accuracy.

   Dr Hubbard concluded: "Several groups are working on the remaining
   chromosomes - tidying them up - and they should all be complete by the
   end of the year."

   Modem fraud forces Irish call ban
   By James Helm
   BBC Dublin correspondent

   Sahara Desert, east of Nouakchott
   Some customers discovered calls to Mauritania on their bills

   Direct dial phone calls from Ireland to 13 other countries are to be
   blocked because of an internet fraud.

   Hundreds of Irish phone users have run up large bills due to
   auto-dialling fraud or modem hijacking.

   About 350 customers have complained their bills included unfamiliar
   calls to a number of countries in the South Pacific, and Mauritania in
   Africa.

   One business discovered it had inadvertently run up a bill of nearly
   12,200 euros (£8,360).

   It is a complex but lucrative fraud. The criminal installs software on
   computers without the knowledge of the user.

   The settings of that computer's internet dial-up are altered, so that
   when the internet is dialled up, it rings a foreign and highly
   expensive number.

   A portion of the cost of that call can then be siphoned off by the
   criminal.

   In response, Ireland is now to block calls to the Cook Islands, the
   Solomon Islands, Mauritania and others as its communications regulator
   tries to stop the fraud.

   A spokesman for the regulator called the action "exceptional", and that
   it was necessary due to an upsurge in complaints.

   Anyone who wants to make a legitimate phone call to one of the 13
   countries must now make a special request to do so.

AT&T Denies Move Away from Windows

   AT&T Denies Move Away from Windows

   "The security and virus argument for Linux and against Windows is real,
   but in many, though not all, aspects, that's a reflection of how much
   more widely Windows is deployed," said Gordon Haff, Illuminata senior
   analyst. "As Linux gets more widely used on the desktop, we'll see more
   viruses and other security vulnerabilities there too."
   By Nancy Cohen
   Oct 5, 2004 12:05 PM PT

   AT&T acknowledged today that it is testing alternative operating
   systems to the Windows platform it now uses, but said the review is not
   specifically related to security concerns.

   Mike Dickman, AT&T spokesperson, said reports suggesting AT&T might be
   considering scrapping Microsoft Windows for Linux are "Fiction. Out of
   context." He said that AT&T has no intention of dropping Microsoft at
   this time.

Evaluating Options

   Dickman said AT&T CIO Hossein Eslambolchi "is evaluating Linux,
   Microsoft and Apple operating system platforms just as any responsible
   CIO would do. These evaluations for the best choice in desktop
   operating-system platforms are an ongoing process."

   "Hossein is confident that Microsoft will address the security
   problems," Dickman said.

   The AT&T review drew attention because it comes in the midst of
   widespread concern about Windows security.

   In addition to the spate of viruses this year attacking Windows,
   antivirus experts recently expressed concern about the possibility of
   virus attack against Microsoft's next incarnation of Windows,
   code-named Longhorn.

Security Concerns

   While Linux has been getting substantial buzz as a safe alternative
   among participants in this discussion, some say it should not be
   considered the magic bullet for AT&T or any other corporation.

   "The security and virus argument for Linux and against Windows is real,
   but in many, though not all, aspects, that's a reflection of how much
   more widely Windows is deployed," said Gordon Haff, Illuminata senior
   analyst.

   "As Linux gets more widely used on the desktop, we'll see more viruses
   and other security vulnerabilities there too," Haff explained.

Potentially Advantageous

   Haff said companies that do move to Linux could realize substantial
   benefits. "Especially for 'transactional desktops,' that is, those
   being used for a small number of specific tasks as opposed to
   general-purpose PCs, the cost savings associated with Linux and
   associated software like OpenOffice can be substantial," Haff told
   TechNewsWorld.

   Haff sees the Linux march moving to a beat dominated by expenses.
   "Although moves to Linux are often couched in other reasons such as
   reliability, security, etcetera, the big driver is usually costs," he
   said. [end-enn.gif]

   Draft of cow 'life code' released

   L1 Dominette 01449 with calf (Michael MacNeil/USDA)
   Dominette with her calf

   Scientists have released a first draft of the bovine genome - a run
   through of the genetic code that describes a cow.

   A fuller version will follow in 2005 but already researchers can use
   the data to compare bovine genes with those from humans and other
   animals.

   This is likely to aid our understanding of human genetics and disease,
   as well as improving the health and well being of cattle themselves.

   Scientists believe the work will also lead to better beef and dairy
   products.

   The genome of the cow (Bos taurus) is being produced by an
   international team led by Dr Richard Gibbs, from Baylor College of
   Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center in Houston, Texas, US.

   COW DNA - BOS TAURUS

   Schematic diagram of DNA (BBC)

   The double-stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical
   components called bases
   Adenine (A) bonds with thymine (T); cytosine(C) bonds with guanine (G)
   Groupings of these letters form the "code of life"; there are estimated
   to be about three billion base-pairs in the cow genome wound into
   31distinct bundles, or chromosomes
   Written in the DNA are possibly 30,000 genes which cow cells use as
   starting templates to make proteins; these sophisticated molecules
   build and maintain the animal's body

   The researchers are using samples from a Hereford cow, named L1
   Dominette 01449, for the bulk of their sequence work.

   This animal is used in beef production. Investigations of the genetics
   of other breeds - including the Holstein, Angus, Jersey, Limousin,
   Norwegian Red and Brahman - are also being conducted to get a broader
   picture of the important genetic factors that control good meat and
   milk production.

   The bovine genome is similar in size to the genomes of humans and other
   mammals, containing approximately three billion DNA base-pairs. Like
   the other mammals already sequenced, or in the process of being
   sequenced, it is expected to have about 30,000 genes.

   So far, the international team has, broadly speaking, read through the
   cow's DNA complement 3.3 times.

   By early next year, the scientists will have been through it six times.
   This should ensure there are no gaps in the sequence, and any mistakes
   have been corrected.

   All the information from the $53m project is being deposited into free
   public databases for use by biomedical and agricultural researchers
   around the globe.

   They can use web tools such as the Ensembl Genome Browser at the
   Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, to mine the data.

   L1 Dominette 01449 (Michael MacNeil/USDA)
   Cows are interesting because traits have been inbred

   Dr Tim Hubbard, who heads up the Human Genome Analysis group at the
   Sanger, says the cow is part of a broad strategy to decode a range of
   animals.

   And comparisons between them should make it easier to understand our
   own biochemistry.

   "From the point of view of them being models, the dog and the cow are
   interesting because they have been inbred for a long time," he told BBC
   News.

   "If you think about the variation in the height of the dog or the
   variation in milk yields in cows or other factors - the point is you
   can relate those things which have been bred against the genes
   underneath. You can use it to understand the relationships you've
   inbred."

   "The cow is a good model because of this long history of human
   breeding."

   Debate rages on world cloning ban

   Cloned human embryos
   Stem cells from cloned embryos could help with the understanding of
   diseases

   The US and other nations have urged the UN to ban all forms of human
   cloning, on the second of two days of debate.

   An opposing group of countries want the cloning of human stem cells to
   be permitted for medical purposes.

   The US has been pushing hard for a ban, but the UN is unlikely to vote
   before the 2 November US election, in which the issue has divided the
   candidates.

   The matter is being discussed at the General Assembly's legal
   committee, which features all 191 UN members.

   Two different resolutions are on the table:

     * One, drawn up by Costa Rica and backed by the United States and 60
       other countries, calls for a treaty to ban all cloning, which it
       calls unethical and morally reproachable
     * Another, drafted by Belgium, would ban cloning humans but allow
       countries to decide for themselves whether they wanted to ban or
       permit "therapeutic cloning" for research.

   Political issue

   Costa Rica's Foreign Affairs and Worship Minister, Roberto Tovar, said
   his country was putting forward an initiative for human dignity.

   On Friday Kenya, Nigeria and Norway were among the countries on the
   same side of the argument, the latter citing "respect for the
   inviolability of life".

   As an individual and in my personal view, I think I would go for
   therapeutic cloning

   Kofi Annan

   However Belgian diplomat Mark Pedsteen said his government's resolution
   focused on what united, rather than divided, the members.

   Sweden and Thailand are among its backers. Sweden argued that "freedom
   of research is essential, and it must always be carried out within
   ethical boundaries".

   Before the meeting, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters it
   was up to member-states to decide - but personally he would back
   therapeutic cloning.

   Last November, the committee narrowly voted to delay considering any
   treaty for two years but this postponement was subsequently reduced to
   a year.

   It is a high-profile issue in the upcoming US presidential election.

   President George W Bush opposes all cloning while his Democratic
   challenger, John Kerry, backs stem cell research.

   South Korea has suggested there should be another year's delay to allow
   time for a UN conference on embryonic stem cell research.

Search and Research: Google Takes Libraries Online

   Search and Research: Google Takes Libraries Online

   Stanford, with 8 million volumes, is the only other library whose
   entire collection will be scanned. To start, about 40,000 works in
   Harvard's collection will go into the project. At Oxford's Bodleian
   Library, Google will scan only books published before 1900.

   Google's quest to aggregate all content on the Web has expanded to
   encompass whole libraries.

   The search engine company announced it would be scanning all or parts
   of the collections of the New York Public Library, Harvard, Oxford,
   Stanford and the University of Michigan, which will then be searchable
   online.

   University of Michigan spokesperson Nancy Connell said the technology
   is non-destructive, so no materials will be harmed in the process.

   Michigan has been working on its own to scan its system, which contains
   7 million volumes, at a pace of 5,000 works per year. Google plans to
   have the entire system completed in six years.

   Connell said the speed is a result of the technology Google will be
   using. The company would not discuss the technology, but said the
   project will cost millions of dollars.

University Ties That Bind

   Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met as graduate students
   at Stanford. Page earned his bachelor's degree at Michigan. Connell
   said Google and the university had been discussing the project for
   several years.

   Searches will provide only blurbs of copyright-protected books. They
   will include directions for finding the hard copies at a library. Works
   whose copyrights have expired will be available online in their
   entireties. The libraries will get digital copies of all the works
   scanned so that they can make them accessible as they see fit.

   Stanford, with 8 million volumes, is the only other library whose
   entire collection will be scanned. To start, about 40,000 works in
   Harvard's collection will go into the project. At Oxford's Bodleian
   Library, Google will scan only books published before 1900. At the New
   York Public Library, only fragile scholarly material with expired
   copyrights fall within the parameters of the project.

Search Links

   Google said it will provide links to search and to partner Amazon.com,
   as well as to libraries where the books can be found.

   The search engine company is not the only one working to get hard copy
   volumes online. The Library of Congress announced it would work with
   several libraries around the world to digitize and make available to
   the public a million books.

   The announcement by Google will likely escalate the search-engine wars
   that have been raging. Microsoft recently announced it was jumping on
   the bandwagon with its own engine. Yahoo has also been trying to keep
   step with Google, and Amazon has its own book search function.

   Polar people 'will need to adapt'

   Sea projections show diminishing summer ice in the Arctic (ACIA)
   Projected summer sea ice: 2010-2030 (top); 2040-2060 (middle);
   2070-2090 (bottom)

   The four million inhabitants of the Arctic will have to change their
   way of life if warming trends in the region continue apace, leaders
   have warned.

   A four-year scientific assessment of climate change in the Arctic has
   been published, and says the area is warming at nearly twice the global
   average.

   The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) will be used by rim nations
   and indigenous groups to inform policy.

   Circumpolar representatives say local people will have to adapt to
   survive.

   "We are asking first for action to slow climate change," said Geir
   Tommy Pedersen, of the Saami Council.

   "However, we realise that we will be forced to make some adaptations,
   as we are already seeing the effects of climate change in our
   communities. We need to be given the resources to deal with these
   challenges."

   An information campaign highlighting the results of the assessment has
   already been started by the Arctic indigenous peoples.

   "We need to tell our own people about what is in this report," said
   Rodion Sulyandziga, of the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of
   the North.

   "They are already facing many challenges, but we must prepare them for
   this challenge also. More than this, we need to tell the rest of the
   world about the necessity of taking action on climate change, and
   taking it now."

   The assessment was prepared by about 300 scientists for the Arctic
   Council, the intergovernmental forum for the eight countries which have
   territories in the region and six indigenous groups.

   It is a review of all that is known about climate change currently in
   the region.

   Its main findings (many highlighted in media reports over the last
   week) are:
     * Average winter temperatures have increased by as much as 3-4C
       (4-7F) in the past 50 years in Alaska, Western Canada, and Eastern
       Russia. Computer models project a rise of 4-7C (7-13F) over the
       next 100 years.
     * Current recorded and observational data show Arctic sea ice is
       thinning fast. Computer models project at least 50% of summer sea
       ice to be gone by 2100, with some simulations even showing complete
       disappearance by the end of the century.
     * Should the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, it is likely
       that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward
       extinction.
     * This would also present huge difficulties for local people who hunt
       food on and around the ice.
     * At the same time, reduced sea ice extent is likely to increase
       marine access to some of the region's resources, including its oil
       and gas reserves.
     * Agriculture will become easier in some areas as the permafrost
       retreats; warmer waters are likely to make some fisheries more
       productive.
     * Warming over Greenland will lead to substantial melting of the
       Greenland Ice Sheet, contributing to global sea-level rise at
       increasing rates.
     * Arctic climate changes present serious challenges to the health and
       food security of some indigenous peoples, challenging the survival
       of some cultures.
     * Over the next 100 years, climate change is expected to accelerate,
       contributing to major physical, ecological, social, and economic
       changes, and the assessment has documented that many of these
       changes have already begun.

   The assessment's findings and projections are being presented in detail
   at a scientific symposium in Reykjavik, Iceland, from Tuesday.

   Its authors say its projections are based on a moderate estimate of
   future emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and
   incorporate results from five major global climate models used by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

   "The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic,"
   says Robert Corell, chair of the ACIA.

   "The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate
   change on earth. The impacts of climate change on the region and the
   globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come."

   Once the researchers have discussed the report, political
   representatives from the Arctic nations - Canada, Denmark, Finland,
   Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the US - and the indigenous groups
   will also gather to mull its findings.

   US urged to help slow Arctic thaw

   Polar bears (University College London)
   Polar bears face extinction due to climate change, scientists say

   Indigenous people from the Arctic have urged the US to cut greenhouse
   gas emissions to slow down the current thaw of the polar ice.

   At a conference in Iceland, they warned their traditional way of life
   was endangered by global warming.

   They accused Washington of thwarting efforts to reduce the problem by
   refusing to sign the Kyoto agreement.

   Scientists have warned that the region is warming twice as quickly as
   the rest of the planet.

   "The short-term economic policy of one country should not be able to
   trump the entire survival of one people," said Sheila Watt-Cloutier,
   the chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) at the end of the
   four-day event.

   "Climate change is not just about weather or sea-ice conditions... it's
   a fight to preserve a way of life," she added.

   A team of international researchers published the results of a study
   before the meeting kicked off, predicting that the summer ice cap could
   melt completely before the end of this century.

   The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment report (ACIA) found that the
   faster warming rate of the Arctic is due to a build-up of greenhouse
   gases, mainly carbon dioxide released from burning oil, coal and gas in
   power plants and cars.

   It also warned that several species including polar bears could
   disappear as a consequence of the melting ice.

   Climate change could also claim human lives, too, it said. There have
   been several incidents in which Inuit hunters have drowned after
   falling through unexpectedly thinner ice.

   The foreign ministers of the eight Arctic nations - the US, Russia,
   Canada, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland - are due to meet
   in Iceland's capital Reykjavik on 24 November to discuss how to fight
   the problem.

   The US, responsible for about a quarter of the world's gas emissions,
   has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The agreement, negotiated in
   1997, requires industrial nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse
   gases below 1990 levels.

   President Bush argues the plan is too costly and unfairly excludes
   developing nations.

   Death of video recorder in sight

   Video recorder The VCR revolutionised viewing habits around the world

   The death of the video cassette recorder appears to be in sight after
   the UK's largest electrical chain said it is to stop selling them.

   Dixons will phase out VCRs due to the boom in DVD players, sales of
   which have grown seven-fold in five years.

   It ends a 26-year love affair with a gadget which changed viewing
   habits by allowing people to leave home without missing their favourite
   programmes.

   Dixons expects to sell its remaining stock of VCRs by Christmas.

   The High Street retailer says demand for VCRs has fallen dramatically
   since the 1990s.

   DVD charm

   It aims to concentrate on their successor, the DVD which has charmed
   consumers with its speed and superior quality.

   John Mewett, marketing director at Dixons, said: "We're saying goodbye
   to one of the most important products in the history of consumer
   technology.

   "The video recorder has been with us for a generation and many of us
   have grown up with the joys and the occasional frustrations of
   tape-based recording.

   "We are now entering the digital age and the new DVD technology
   available represents a step change in picture quality and convenience."

   The final nail in the coffin for VCRs is the low price of DVD players,
   which can now be bought for as little as £25.

   The cost of DVD recorders are also falling to a level within reach of
   many consumers.

   The BBC's business reporter Hywel Jones said: "So far Dixons is the
   only major chain to abandon sales of VCRs.

   "But video cassettes are likely to join record players and Rubik Cubes
   as objects of nostalgic affection.

   The first video cassette recorder went on sale at Dixons in 1978 priced
   £798.75 - the equivalent of about £3,000 in today's money.

   It was made by Japanese electronics giant JVC and had a slot in the top
   to insert the tape and piano-style keys.

   Betamax battle

   The early 1980s saw a battle between VHS and its main competitor
   Betamax, from Sony.

   VHS eventually won, largely because it was the format favoured by
   rental shops which many households used due to their cost.

   By 1990 more than 200m video cassette recorders a year were sold
   worldwide.

   However, there is still hope for VHS fans or those with large tape
   collections.

   Currys, the sister company of Dixons, will continue to sell the
   machines for the time being.

   Department store John Lewis also said it had no plans to phase them
   out.

   Dan Knowles, director of buying for electrical and home technology at
   John Lewis, said: "Sales of VCRs are in decline but we still sell a lot
   of them.

   "As long as there is a market for them we will continue to sell them."

   New browser wins over net surfers

   Screengrab from Mozilla homepage, Mozilla Foundation
   Firefox is made by Mozilla which was responsible for Netscape

   The proportion of surfers using Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) has
   dropped to below 90%, say web analysts.

   Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source
   browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users
   away from IE.

   While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla
   browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%.

   Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former
   browser maker Netscape in 1998.

   Although there have been other preview versions of Firefox, version 1.0
   was the first complete official program.

   "It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer
   to Mozilla's new Firefox browser," said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of
   Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.

   Strong grip

   Mozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market
   share, the figures suggest. Mozilla said that more than five million
   have downloaded the free software since its official release.

   Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise
   $250,000 (£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New
   York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation.

   There was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release.

   MOST POPULAR BROWSERS

   1 - Microsoft IE 6.0: 80.95%
   2 - Microsoft IE 5.0: 4.18%
   3 - Microsoft IE 5.5: 3.66%
   4 - Mozilla Firefox 0.10: 2.79%
   5 - Mozilla 1.x: 2.77%
   6 - Mozilla Firefox 1.0: 1.79%
   7 - Opera 7.x: 1.29%

   Source: OneStat.com Nov 2004

   The figures echo similar research from net analyst WebSideStory which
   suggested that IE had 92.9% of users in October compared to 95.5% in
   June.

   Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after
   taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always
   stayed at around the 95% mark.

   Firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. That means
   people are free to adapt the software's core code to create other
   innovative features, like add-ons or extensions to the program.

   Fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in Firefox than
   in IE.

   Paul Randle, Microsoft Windows Client product manager, responded to the
   figures: "We certainly respect that some customers will choose
   alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a
   handful of features.

   "Microsoft continues to make significant investments in IE, including
   Service Pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to
   encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for Internet
   Explorer."

   Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. Other
   browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging
   Microsoft's grip on the browser market. Opera is set to release its
   version 7.60 by the end of the year.

   OneStat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net
   users in 100 countries.

   Death deluge makes forest mulch

   Cicada, Yang
   The insects emerge from below ground and swarm over the landscape every
   13 or 17 years

   The nutrient boost given to North American forests when trillions of
   cicadas die en masse is explored in a new study in Science magazine.

   The insects emerge from below ground and swarm over the landscape every
   13 or 17 years to briefly sing and mate.

   Their decomposing carcasses will increase bacteria, fungi and nitrogen
   in forest soils, Louie Yang shows.

   This may explain why trees grow faster following cicada emergences, the
   University of California scientist says

   "This observation doesn't necessarily mean the pattern comes from
   cicada 'fertilisation'; it's one possible hypothesis," Yang told BBC
   News.

   "Another explanation says adult cicadas cause damage to trees that
   makes more light available in certain parts of the forest; but it's
   certainly a very interesting pattern."

   Soil changes

   The eastern states of the US have several broods of periodical cicadas
   (Magicicada spp).

   17-YEAR CICADA LIFECYCLE

   1. Female lays eggs and dies soon after. Eggs hatch.
   2. Bugs or 'nymphs' drop to the ground
   3. Nymphs live underground feeding on tree roots
   4. After 17 years, nymphs tunnel to surface, crawl up trees and shed
   skins to become adults
   5. Adults mate during May and June of 17th year

   The insects spend most of their lives as juveniles, feeding on the
   xylem in tree roots and growing slowly.

   Then, timed to perfection, huge populations come out together to
   reproduce.

   May and June of this year saw the emergence of the so-called Brood X,
   which swarmed over more than 10 US states, including Georgia, Indiana,
   Kentucky, New York and Ohio.

   The cicada onslaught lasts only a few weeks - but is deafening. The
   males sing to their partners with high pitched trills, made by
   vibrating abdominal drums called timbales.

   The mass emergence can be extraordinarily dense; up to 350 insects per
   square metre. It provides a feast for a host of other animals -
   including birds, racoons, foxes and skunks - but they cannot hope to
   eat all the cicadas and most will simply die and drop to the floor to
   rot.

   Louie Yang set up experimental plots to examine the impact on the
   forest system of this death deluge.

   His work demonstrates how the mass of carcases leads to a dramatic
   increase in fungal and bacterial decomposers in the soil. This in turn
   triples soil ammonium, and more than doubles soil nitrate
   concentration.

   Seed size

   "We can see a trend which shows that increasing the density of dead
   cicadas increases the amount of soil nitrogen in the ecosystem - it
   creates a pulse of nitrogen in the soil," Yang said.

   Cicada, Yang
   The cicada onslaught lasts only a few weeks - but is deafening

   This rush of soil nutrients can be seen in the fillip it gives to a
   forest-floor plant, the American bellflower (Campanulastrum
   americanum), which grows across the range of the cicada emergences.

   The plants in Yang's plots took up more nitrogen and increased the size
   of their seeds by 9%.

   The cicadas are, of course, just returning nitrogen they "stole" when
   they were sucking on plant roots as nymphs. And the cycle will always
   show something of a deficit because of the substantial numbers of
   cicadas that are lost to the system through predation.

   Nonetheless, it is an eye-catching observation that tree-ring growth
   data appears linked to the insects' cycle.

   Cicadas, Yang
   The mass emergence can be extraordinarily dense

   "A couple of studies have found a robust result that there is a
   decrease in the growth of trees during cicada emergence years, but one
   of the results in more recent research suggests there may be increases
   in the growth rate of trees in some of the years following cicada
   emergence."

   He added: "There's an awful lot we don't know about the ecology that
   happens in our backyard - and these are insects that truly do occur in
   our backyard; this year they were flying into our cars and bumping into
   us as we crossed the street.

   "These are insects that are everywhere but there is still a great deal
   we don't know about them."

   Robots rejected for Hubble rescue

   Astronaut Steven Smith performs maintenance on the Hubble Space
   Telescope, AP
   Hubble needs regular maintenance

   Shuttle astronauts would do a better job of upgrading the ailing Hubble
   Space Telescope than robots, a panel of space experts has said.

   The panel was set up to look at ways of servicing Hubble, which needs
   replacement gyroscopes and batteries and some new instruments.

   A robotic mission was favoured by Nasa chief Sean O'Keefe in the
   aftermath of the Columbia space shuttle disaster.

   Nasa said it would study the report but would not comment on its
   findings now.

   "A shuttle servicing mission is the best option for extending the life
   of the Hubble telescope and ultimately de-orbiting it safely," said
   Louis Lanzerotti, head of the expert panel charged with investigating
   how to fix the 14-year-old orbiting observatory.

   Safety concern

   Mr O'Keefe cancelled a planned shuttle servicing mission to the
   telescope in January due to safety concerns after the break-up of space
   shuttle Columbia on re-entry.

   But following pressure from astronomers and fans, the Nasa chief
   requested proposals for a robot that could service the telescope.

   Now, Dr Lanzerotti and other panel members have decided the plan for a
   robotic mission is more technologically risky - and far less likely to
   actually fix Hubble.

   They told a news conference that the risk to astronauts in a shuttle
   repair mission was about the same as that involved in travelling to the
   International Space Station (ISS).

   No shuttles have flown since the Columbia accident on 1 February 2003
   killed seven astronauts. Flights are not expected to resume before next
   May.

   Any shuttle mission to Hubble would have to be slotted into a schedule
   of flights already planned to the ISS, said panel member Richard Truly.

   Tool use confirmed in monkeys

   Capuchin monkey, Moura
   Hard times may make tool use more important

   UK researchers have collected the first hard evidence of monkeys using
   tools, Science magazine reports.

   Cambridge researchers observed wild capuchin monkeys in the Brazilian
   forest using stones to help them forage for food on an almost daily
   basis.

   Scientists have already known for some time that capuchins use tools in
   captivity, but have only occasionally observed them doing so in the
   wild.

   But the latest findings confirm that the tool use was habitual, or
   routine.

   The monkeys used tools for digging, for cracking seeds and hollow
   branches, digging for tubers (nutritious plant storage organs such as
   potatoes that often lie below the ground) and for probing tree holes or
   rock crevices.

   They captured the monkeys on video in the Caatinga dry forests of
   northeastern Brazil.

   Monkeying around

   Digging was the most frequent type of tool use observed. The monkeys
   typically held the stone with one hand and used it to hit the ground
   quickly three to six times, while simultaneously scooping away the soil
   with the other hand.

   In Science, Antonio Moura and Phyllis Lee write that the results
   suggest wild capuchin monkeys are far more skilled at understanding
   cause and effect than previously thought.

   "We think these findings are extremely important for understanding the
   role of tools in cognitive evolution," said Mr Moura.

   "I'm looking forward to returning to the field to try to specify more
   about the nature of the tools."

   But the Cambridge anthropologists also propose that the monkeys may
   only use tools under certain ecological conditions, such as the long
   dry seasons of the Caatinga.

   When food availability is stretched, using tools may be crucial,
   allowing the monkeys to obtain nutritional foods such as tubers that
   are otherwise inaccessible.

   Antonio Moura observed the monkeys using tools a total of 154 times
   from October 2000 to March 2002.

   The routine use of tools is well known in great apes such as
   chimpanzees. But making the step between these crude tools and those
   made by early humans required a giant cognitive leap.

   Chimps can be shown how to strike flakes of stone from a "core" to use
   as cutting tools, as our early ancestors did.

   But they seem unable to understand that making useful cutting flakes
   depends on striking the core at the right angle and with the right
   force - a skill that seemed to come naturally to even the earliest
   human tool-makers.

Microsoft Sings a New Tune With Windows Media Player 10

   By Rob Pegoraro
   The Washington Post
   Sunday, September 12, 2004; Page F07

   It's amazing to see what an entrenched monopolist will do when it
   finally meets real competition.

   For years, Microsoft saw no threat to its Windows Media Player from
   such competing music programs as Musicmatch or RealPlayer, which
   demanded that users either pay up for a full-featured "Pro" or "Plus"
   version or put up with frequent nags to upgrade.

   So Microsoft's program saw minimal improvement; the company put more
   effort into enhancing the audio and video formats it plays, which it
   would love to see Hollywood adopt.

   But last October, Apple released a Windows version of its iTunes music
   jukebox -- and PC users no longer had to choose between Windows Media
   Player's inadequacies or Real or Musicmatch's annoyances. They could
   download a free program that provided all the functions, from MP3
   ripping to fast CD burning, that cost extra elsewhere.

   Somebody at Microsoft must have noticed this change, and so we have the
   new Windows Media Player 10. With this update -- a free download,
   Windows XP only, at www.microsoft.com/
   windowsmedia -- Windows Media Player moves from unacceptable to usable,
   and in a few cases, exceptional.

   This music, video and DVD program's new interface immediately sets it
   apart. (Though I still don't see the point of its video support; I just
   don't see that many people squirreling away video clips on their hard
   drives the way they collect MP3s. Besides, any machine with a DVD drive
   already includes separate playback software.)

   In place of the old, designed-by-committee interface, major functions
   are lined up left to right -- "Now Playing," "Library," "Rip," "Burn,"
   "Sync," and "Guide" -- with less extraneous clutter. Window borders
   sport a slick brushed-aluminum look, as if this application were
   ordered from the Sharper Image catalogue.

   Unfortunately, this program's menus -- needed to access such key
   features as its options window -- hide behind a tiny icon at the top
   right corner.

   Most playback tasks can be done in this program's Library screen, which
   offers numerous thoughtful ways to organize a collection. Beyond the
   usual artist, album and genre groupings, you can sort tracks by such
   details as their year of release -- just the thing to create a
   happy-birthday mix CD. The program can generate an extensive array of
   "auto playlists" based on a long list of custom criteria (for example,
   what you listen to on weekdays versus weekends).

   At the right hand of the screen, a "now playing list" pane allows you
   to shuffle the order of upcoming tracks. And at the top, there's now a
   search form that's always present, instead of a button you click to
   open a search form.

                                                CONTINUED    1 2    Next >

World: Spacecraft Begins To Unravel Mysteries Of Saturn's Moon

   more studies are needed to understand the exact nature of the moon's

   explain the origins of life. The spacecraft is due to pass by Titan

   mysterious surface.

   By Jan Jun

   November 05, 2004
   London, 5 November 2004 (RFE/RL) -- Scientists around the world are
   still studying the amazing data about Saturn's moon Titan sent back by
   the U.S.-European spacecraft "Cassini-Huygens."
   The spacecraft flew past Titan on 26 October, getting as close as 1,200
   kilometers from the moon's surface, which is shrouded in clouds and
   haze.
   But scientists remain perplexed. Professor John Zarnecki is a member of
   the "Cassini-Huygens" science team at Britain's Open University.
   "Mysterious. I have to say that Titan seems to be holding its mystery
   to the very last minute. There was part of me which thought that the
   fly-by last week would reveal everything, and there will be nothing
   left for us to find out. But, in fact, it seems it is as mysterious as
   ever," Zarnecki says.
   "If the surface turned out to be made of cheese, or marzipan, or
   whatever, there is actually nothing that we can change about the
   descent and landing."
   Zarnecki says the data revealed outlines of peculiar dark and light
   features on Titan's surface, raising questions about their nature and
   composition.
   "We've got the radar images; we've got the near-infrared images. Nobody
   still knows what the hell is down there. Is it a hydrocarbon ocean? Is
   it ice? Is it hydrocarbon gunge or goo-like tar? I think we still don't
   know. For me, what is odd is that in the images that we see, there are
   not many or no impact craters. The surface is active. There are things
   happening which are covering up or eroding," Zarnecki says.
   Zarnecki also notes that some images show strange streaks, similar to
   ones observed on Mars which wind may have caused.
   "There's one or two that certainly seem to indicate some sort of fluid
   flow. And what is the fluid? Is it wind as on Mars? Could it be liquid
   flow? Some people are saying it is ice flow, because ice, of course,
   does flow as a very viscous liquid, in a way," Zarnecki says.
   Other scientists agree that many questions remain. But they point out
   that the spacecraft's close encounter has already provided some
   important data.
   Titan's environment can finally be understood and compared to
   conditions on other planets. Dr. Andrew Coates is a member of the
   "Cassini-Huygens" team at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at the
   University College London.
   "We can see methane clouds which change in size, so that's indicating
   an active weather system involving methane. The radar instrument was
   able to look at 1 percent of the surface of Titan, and in that was a
   tantalizing glimpse of what could be liquid methane on the surface. The
   whole environment of Titan seems to be completely full of
   hydrocarbons," Coates says.
   "Cassini" is expected to carry out 45 more encounters with Titan over
   the next four years.
   But Coates says some remaining mysteries should be revealed during the
   next fly-by on 13 December, before the "Huygens" surface probe enters
   its murky atmosphere.
   "The 'Huygens' mission will be released on Christmas Day European time
   [25 December] from the 'Cassini' orbiter, and then will land on 15
   January. That then will give us the ground truth for these remote
   sensing measurements. Before that, we have another Titan fly-by with
   which we will be able sort of refine the models of what the surface is
   like. But, at the moment, we do not know whether the probe is going to
   land with a splash, a squelch, or a thump," Coates says.
   Zarnecki points out that data about the density of Titan's atmosphere
   jives well with previous models that estimated it as being twice as
   thick as the Earth's atmosphere. He says that should help the "Huygens"
   probe to land safely.
   However, the scientist says nothing can be done to steer the probe once
   it pierces Titan's methane atmosphere:
   "If the surface turned out to be made of cheese, or marzipan, or
   whatever, there is actually nothing that we can change about the
   descent and landing," Zarnecki says.
   Despite all these unknowns, Zarnecki remains confident the
   "Cassini-Huygens" mission will eventually reveal some of Titan's
   deepest mysteries.

Oracle Won't Predict PeopleSoft Acquisition

Antitrust Win Was Just First of Hurdles

   By David A. Vise
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, September 15, 2004; Page E05

   Oracle Corp. may have won a major antitrust fight with the Justice
   Department last week over its proposed acquisition of PeopleSoft Inc.,
   but that doesn't mean the company is on the verge of closing the deal.

   Yesterday, Oracle Co-President Safra A. Catz cautioned Wall Street
   analysts that a litany of legal and regulatory hurdles make it
   impossible to predict the timing of a possible takeover of PeopleSoft,
   which specializes in business software that automates payroll and
   personnel processing. In addition, PeopleSoft chief executive Craig A.
   Conway has told his employees that the company intends to continue
   vigorously opposing a takeover by Oracle.
   Oracle has the will and the means to buy PeopleSoft, but the takeover
   faces so many obstacles that executives refuse to say when it might
   happen. (Paul Sakuma -- AP)

   Oracle struck a careful and measured tone yesterday during a quarterly
   earnings conference call. The company's colorful chief executive, the
   normally voluble billionaire Lawrence J. Ellison, was noticeably absent
   from the call.

   Oracle executives stressed that the company would not overpay for
   PeopleSoft, and said it remains focused on improving its own results.
   The company's quarterly earnings beat Wall Street estimates by a penny
   per share, and executives noted that it was the seventh straight
   quarter of double-digit growth in earnings for the giant computer
   software provider.

   Oracle currently is offering $21 a share, or $7.7 billion, for
   PeopleSoft, though analysts have said it would likely take a bid in the
   range of $25 a share to win control. Wall Street analysts asked a
   number of questions yesterday about the long-running hostile takeover
   bid for PeopleSoft, which Catz ultimately addressed.

   "We can't close at this time," Catz said, "because we have not received
   clearance from the European Commission. In addition, the PeopleSoft
   board has a poison pill which would make the transaction prohibitively
   expensive for us, and we are starting a suit in Delaware Chancery Court
   to have that poison pill removed. At this point, we continue to have a
   waiting period. There isn't anything imminent as far as our ability to
   close because of those blocks at this time."

   Last week, U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker in San Francisco
   concluded that the market for business software involves numerous
   players and is highly competitive, rejecting arguments made by the
   Justice Department that Oracle's proposed acquisition of PeopleSoft
   would reduce the field of contenders so much that companies would lack
   the incentive to compete on price or to innovate. Meanwhile,
   PeopleSoft's lawsuit accusing Oracle of using the takeover bid as a
   ploy to intentionally harm its business is slated to go to trial this
   fall in California.

   In its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, Oracle's net income
   increased 16 percent, to $509 million (10 cents a share) from $440
   million (8 cents) in the same period last year. Sales grew 7 percent,
   to $2.2 billion from $2.1 billion.

Kerry Conran Sees Computerized 'Sky Captain' as Film's Future

   By William Booth
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, September 15, 2004; Page C01

   LOS ANGELES -- He is like that guy who worked in your office once, the
   shy tech-geek, the temp down in IT, who typed Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the
   keypad when your hard drive seized up. Until very recently, that guy
   was Kerry Conran.

   For more than a decade, Conran was the computer nerd at a series of
   temporary jobs at newspapers and magazines, living in his little
   apartment in the San Fernando Valley. He didn't want money. No, he
   wanted to barter for his services, for 3-D graphic software and hard
   drives with mega-capacity. "Every job I took, it was with computer
   parts in mind," he says. "And that's how I built my Frankenstein."

   Conran never cared much about rebooting your system. Rather, he was
   imagining, with a kind of mad scientist desire, rebooting the entire
   movie industry.

   And now the world can see what Conran has wrought, with the release
   Friday of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," a movie the
   writer-director began envisioning when he was 10 years old.

   It is a fantastical and original piece of work, that feels at once
   comfortable and nostalgic but weird and new. Set in 1939, it stars Jude
   Law as the dashing Sky Captain, Gwyneth Paltrow as the plucky reporter
   Polly Perkins and Angelina Jolie as the eye-patched Franky Cook.

   The actors are real. But everything else in the movie has been created
   on a computer. No locations. No sets. Every backdrop and scene that
   appears in the movie -- the giant robots marching down Sixth Avenue;
   the hanging gardens of Shangri-La; the undersea lair of the evil
   mastermind Totenkopf; Radio City Music Hall -- exist only on a hard
   drive, put together from a melange of photographs, paintings and
   animation.

   The actors spent 26 days on a soundstage in London (most movies shoot
   for three or four months), performing their scenes against a completely
   blue background, blue from floor to wall to ceiling, a blank canvas.
   And then Conran and his team added everything else -- the zeppelin
   docking at the Empire State Building, the tiny elephant that could fit
   into the palm of your hand, the flying aircraft carrier, the undersea
   monsters.

   Many action adventure movies today employ computer-animation and
   special effects, but they also use real locales, build elaborate stage
   sets and create their monsters out of plastic, foam, paint and wire.
   The actors in 1988's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" were famously shot on a
   blue screen, but only animation was inserted around them. "Sky Captain"
   is different; it is one giant special effect.

   Conran believes that his techniques -- the live-action movie taking
   place on a virtual set -- will usher in "a renaissance of independent
   filmmaking." With a computer-generated world for the actors to move
   through, Conran says a film can take place anywhere one's imagination
   can go, ancient Egypt or Mars in 2054. For a fraction of the cost, he
   says.

   "The studios today are in this awkward and horrible position where
   films cost so much money to make, they have to be cautious so they can
   appeal to the broadest audience, so that is half the point of this
   experiment, to see if independent filmmakers and studios can both take
   chances again, to think differently."

   Looking at Conran -- even now, at the Paramount lot, dressed in short
   pants, sneakers and ball cap, a big overgrown kid at 38 -- it is hard
   to imagine how he secured the talents of three of Hollywood's most
   bankable stars and was given a reported $70 million to create his
   vision.

   He grew up in Flint, the Michigan auto industry town. His dad worked
   for Chevrolet as a middle manager in charge of stocking parts for the
   assembly line. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore worked back then
   down the block at the Flint Voice, a little newspaper. Conran never met
   him.

   As a kid, Conran and his older brother Kevin (who worked on "Sky
   Captain" and was Conran's first hire on the film as production
   designer) were enthralled by old movies broadcast from Chicago station
   WGN every Sunday. "All this goes back to my earliest days of watching
   those movies. 'King Kong' and 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.'
   Preston Sturges films and ones like 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' I
   just loved them. There was a whimsy to them, an innocence, but this
   level of imagination that was just amazing."

   Like the flying monkeys in "The Wizard of Oz"? "Oh, man, the flying
   monkeys underlie everything. That's it! It was a time and a world where
   flying monkeys could not only happen, but were celebrated. That's it. A
   world where everything is possible." Zeppelins docking at skyscrapers
   and miniature elephants. "But with that awkwardness," Conran says.
   "That innocence." Corny but amazing; that's the aesthetic he is most
   drawn to. Conran left Flint, the first in his family to do so, to
   attend CalArts, the filmmaking school in Los Angeles. Around this time,
   Conran began to think about the possibility of making a movie entirely
   on a computer. The software was growing more sophisticated by the day.
   After graduation, on a Macintosh IIci he bartered for, he began the
   early version, the 1.0, of "The World of Tomorrow." Animating his giant
   robots. Constructing his virtual Manhattan. After four years of work,
   he had six minutes of film.

   One night a friend of a friend, Marsha Oglesby, a Hollywood producer,
   came by for dinner and persuaded Conran to show her the six minutes.
   She was blown away by its look and feel. She showed the movie to her
   boss, Jon Avnet, who showed it and the script to Jude Law, who showed
   it to Gwyneth Paltrow, and then they brought in Italian producer
   Aurelio De Laurentiis for financing and Paramount bought the domestic
   rights.

   The industry trades estimate the movie eventually cost $70 million to
   make. Not cheap. Conran says he is not an accountant, shrugs and says,
   "What the movie cost is one-quarter to one-third of a live-action
   summer movie like 'Van Helsing' or 'Spider-Man.' " In a warehouse in
   Van Nuys, Calif., Conran, his brother and their crew used the script to
   create a series of hand-drawn storyboards for the whole movie, a common
   technique. Then they transferred those images into the computer and
   made a moving motion picture, crude but watchable, a rough draft called
   an animatic, where the planes fly and cartoon characters move. "It's
   uncanny how much the animated version duplicates the finished film shot
   for shot."

   Conran and team could decide, from the animatic, all their virtual
   camera angles and virtual shots. In London, they built a huge blue
   soundstage. Nothing but blue. And placed numbered dots on the floor.
   "The dots would be this grid, and when we filmed a scene, say at Radio
   City Music Hall, we'd tell Gwyneth to walk from G1 to H5 to J17 and the
   camera would be set on F12 filming."

   Before shooting the take, Paltrow would be able to watch the animatic
   of her cartoon character walking through Radio City. So she would be
   able to act, and react, to things that weren't there, like Giant
   Robots.

   As Conran filmed Paltrow, he could also watch another screen that
   allowed him see Paltrow moving through his computer-generated sets.
   Conran says: "The benefit for the actors was they could watch the
   movie, the scene, in the animatic version before we shoot it on the
   soundstage. And it helped that they had theater experience, but really
   the acting was more like a play than a movie."

   Conran and crew also had a rule: The only things real in the film are
   the actors, their costumes and any object they physically touched. So
   Law would hold a glass of Milk of Magnesia or a ray gun, and that prop
   would be real, but the room he was in would be created on the computer.

   After the principal filming was completed in London, Conran and his
   illustrators could then tweak every scene, changing the lighting,
   making the zeppelins or sea monsters bigger, smaller, brighter or
   darker. "We would generate backgrounds, literally making paintings on
   glass canvas," scanning them into the computer, "then adding
   photographs we'd alter or enhance and 3-D imagery we'd create from
   scratch."

   "The beauty was we could do anything we wanted," he says. It was also a
   bit of a curse. The movie was scheduled to be released in June but was
   held until September as the tweaking continued.

   Conran is already writing the script and imagining the visuals for his
   next movie, based on "Tarzan" author Edgar Rice Burroughs's "John
   Carter of Mars" series of pulp novels, a project that filmmakers have
   been thinking about for the past 50 years.

   "It's going to be a hideously gigantic film," Conran says. And why not,
   since it will be mostly generated on computers. "Exactly," Conran says.
   "Why not?"

Northwest Ticket Fees Urge Web Use

   By Keith L. Alexander
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, August 25, 2004; Page E01

   Beginning Friday, travelers on Northwest Airlines will have to pay as
   much as $10 extra to buy tickets by phone or in person, rather than
   through Northwest's Web site.

   Hoping to trim about $70 million in annual ticket distribution costs,
   the nation's fourth-largest carrier said yesterday that it would charge
   $5 to process tickets purchased over the phone and $10 for tickets
   purchased at an airport ticket counter. The fees will appear as an
   itemized charge on receipts, similar to a fuel surcharge.

                         ^_____Related Stories^_____

   The fees will apply only to new ticket issuance. No fee will be charged
   to discuss a new or existing reservation with an airport customer
   service agent or a telephone reservations sales agent.

   The idea of charging customers to interact with an actual person is not
   new. As early as 1995, several banks began testing the concept to get
   more people to use ATM machines, but later backed off. And a number of
   computer manufacturers charge customers to get technical support
   assistance over the phone after an initial warranty period.

   Airlines have been trying for several years to drive passengers to
   purchase tickets from their Web sites because it is less expensive than
   other means and requires fewer employees. Several airlines have offered
   extra frequent-flier miles or $5 to $10 discounts to travelers if they
   purchase their tickets from the carrier's Web site.

   But industry watchers say this is the first time an airline is charging
   travelers a fee not for a convenience or a special service, but just
   for purchasing a ticket.

   "I'm not sure why Northwest thinks they should charge people $5 for
   picking up the phone and calling their people," said Tom Parsons,
   editor and publisher of Best Fares magazine.

   Also yesterday, Northwest announced that beginning Sept. 1 the airline
   will charge $3.75 for one-way tickets and $7.50 for round-trip tickets
   to U.S. and Canadian travel agents and Web sites that use global
   computer reservations systems. These systems allow travel agents and
   some travel Web sites, such as Expedia.com and Travelocity.com, to
   search and navigate through thousands of fares and schedules for
   booking flights.

   And separately, United Airlines announced that beginning Oct. 15
   members of its frequent-flier program who want to exchange miles for
   free tickets will have to pay $15 to book them through one of their
   reservation agents. There will be no fee if travelers book their
   tickets through United's Web site, United spokeswoman Jenna Obluck
   said.

   In a statement yesterday, John Stow, president of Sabre Travel Network,
   the nation's largest computer reservations system, called Northwest's
   move "anti-consumer and anti-travel agent." Sabre, which along with
   Travelocity is owned by Sabre Holdings Corp. and is widely used by
   travel agents, said that in response it would give more prominent
   display on computer screens to other airlines that do not have such
   fees.

   J. Timothy Griffin, Northwest's executive vice president of marketing
   and distribution, said the airline began charging the fees to be more
   in line with low-cost carriers, particularly JetBlue Airways and
   Dulles-based Independence Air.

   "Since we compete with low-cost carriers on price, it is essential that
   we take steps to be competitive with them on distribution costs, where
   they currently have a clear cost-of-business advantage over Northwest,"
   Griffin said.

   But neither JetBlue nor Independence directly charges fees to book
   travel through their call center. Instead, both carriers, like many
   other airlines such as US Airways, discount the listed price of their
   tickets by as much as $10 if the ticket is purchased via the airlines'
   Web sites.

   Northwest's Griffin said only 16 percent of its tickets are sold via
   its Web site, while JetBlue and Southwest Airlines sell about 75
   percent and 55 percent of their tickets, respectively, through their
   respective sites. About 22 percent of Northwest's tickets are sold via
   its telephone reservation agents and only 2 percent of its tickets are
   sold at airport ticket counters. Northwest closed its city ticket
   offices earlier this year.

   Last year, Northwest began charging its customers a $50 fee if they
   call one of its agents to change the date, route or time of a frequent
   flier ticket rather than going to its Web site, if the call is made
   within 30 days before departure.

   Northwest's moves come as it is trying to cut its annual labor costs by
   $950 million. Griffin said the airline is in talks with its pilots
   union and hopes to have the concessions in place by the fall.

   Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report.

'Registered Travelers' Give Up Personal Information for Shorter Airport Lines

   By Sara Kehaulani Goo
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, August 25, 2004; Page E01

   Steve Daniels leaned forward for a machine to take a photo of his eye,
   then placed his right index finger on a small digital scanner.
   Instantly, a large black and white image of his fingerprint appeared on
   a screen. The image wiggled slightly as Daniels moved his finger.

   "Wow!" he said.
   Soo Cho had an iris scan yesterday at Reagan National Airport. Along
   with the scan, she provided personal information and a fingerprint
   reading to become a "registered traveler" on American Airlines. (Cathy
   Kapulka -- The Washington Post)

   Within seconds, Daniels, a computer consultant whose company is based
   in Annapolis, joined 125 other local travelers who signed up yesterday
   to become "registered travelers" at Reagan National Airport. The test
   project, which aims to give frequent fliers a quicker pass through
   security checkpoints, is already underway at four other airports. It
   relies on the latest biometric technologies to verify a passenger's
   identity with increased precision. Digital fingerprint scans and
   photographs are already used to identify foreigners traveling on a
   visa, and U.S. officials plan to encode a facial recognition technology
   into passports.

   "It was fun -- it was also a little weird," said Mark Senak, an
   Arlington resident who signed up for the program yesterday and said he
   had never had his iris scanned. "I travel so much that anything that
   can lessen the hassle is worth it."

   The Transportation Security Administration and select airlines are
   cooperating on the program, which will last 90 days at airports in
   Washington, Boston, Los Angeles, Houston and Minneapolis. The aim at
   National is to sign up members of Congress and frequent fliers and
   speed them through a special security lane equipped with scanners. More
   than 7,000 passengers across the country have signed up so far, and the
   TSA said hundreds of passengers use the designated security lanes each
   day.

   But the success of the pilot project since its launch in July has been
   uneven. The Northwest Airlines Corp. program in Minneapolis proved so
   popular that it exceeded its target enrollment, an airline spokesman
   said. Northwest had offered 1,000 frequent-flier miles to invited
   passengers who signed up.

   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, however, did not offer free miles and had
   less success in Los Angeles when it launched its program last month.
   When passengers only trickled in to the sign-up counters, the TSA
   extended the enrollment period an extra week. "It wasn't really
   enticing for people to battle L.A. traffic to sign up" at the airport,
   said United spokesman Jeff Green. He said enrollment has improved, but
   "it's so new, I don't think we can gauge the response at this point."

   A steady stream of passengers handpicked by AMR Corp.'s American
   Airlines showed up yesterday at a sectioned-off area of National
   Airport's baggage claim to submit to the scans, present two forms of
   government identification and fill out a form that will be used to
   perform a criminal background check. The form requested a place of
   birth, birth date, address, e-mail address, home phone number, cell
   phone number, eye color, U.S. citizenship status, height and residences
   over the past five years. Eligible passengers will be able to use the
   new security checkpoint lane after Labor Day.

   No members of Congress had signed up yet but 312 passengers had
   registered so far over the two days of the program at National, a TSA
   contractor said.

   The program offers the first wide application of iris-scanning
   technology, which had previously been used only for government
   employees with access to classified sites or for employees with access
   to nuclear facilities, said Paul Mirenda, director of field operations
   for LG Electronics Inc., one of the TSA's contractors that makes the
   scanners. The technology takes a close-up photograph of the iris, which
   has more unique characteristics than a fingerprint, and applies digital
   codes to the photograph to store it as a bar code. The photograph and
   fingerprint are then stored in a file along with other information
   about the passenger.

WTO Delays Decision on E.U.'s Biotech Ban

Scientists Allowed to Testify in Debate

   By Paul Geitner
   Associated Press
   Friday, August 27, 2004; Page E02

   BRUSSELS, Aug. 26 -- The United States will have to wait until next
   year to see its fight with the European Union over biotech foods
   resolved, as the World Trade Organization agreed to an E.U. request to
   bring scientists into the debate, officials said Thursday.

   A WTO panel in Geneva decided Aug. 20 to allow expert testimony before
   deciding on the complaint filed last year by the United States, Canada
   and Argentina over the E.U.'s moratorium on approving genetically
   modified foods for sale in Europe.

   That means the panel's report, initially expected before the end of
   this year, now will be delayed until late March, according to WTO
   documents.

   The United States argued that scientific advice was not needed because
   the case revolved around legal issues, while the E.U. sought to move
   the debate from trade rules to health and environmental protection.

   A U.S. official said the government accepted the panel's decision and
   would help frame the questions to be debated. There was no immediate
   E.U. comment.

   The E.U. ended its six-year moratorium in May when it allowed onto the
   market a modified strain of sweet corn, grown mainly in the United
   States.

   Another herbicide-resistant corn was approved for animal feed last
   month. In both cases, the decision was made by the E.U.'s executive
   commission after ministers from the 25 member governments deadlocked on
   the applications.

   The political stalemate highlights continuing unease in Europe over
   biotech foods, despite the introduction last spring of what are
   considered the world's most stringent labeling requirements.

   The United States has said it will continue with its WTO case until it
   sees a "predictable, ongoing process" based on science, not politics.
   It also opposes the E.U.'s strict labeling, saying it unnecessarily
   scares away consumers.

   Biotech crops have been widely grown in the United States for years,
   including corn and soybeans genetically modified to resist insects or
   disease. U.S. farm exporters contend the ban has stopped about $300
   million in annual sales of bioengineered corn to Europe.

   U.S. officials have expressed concerns that Europe's anti-biotech
   sentiment is spreading to developing countries, exacerbating global
   hunger.

   WTO spokesman Peter Ungphakorn in Geneva said it was not unusual for
   the trade organization to seek scientific advice. Scientists have been
   called in to assist panels dealing with disputes over asbestos and
   animal- and plant-health issues.

   An anti-biotech group, Friends of the Earth Europe, called the WTO
   panel's decision a first-round victory for the E.U. but attacked the
   "secretive and undemocratic" WTO for getting involved at all.

   "Every country should have the right to put public safety before the
   economic might of the biotechnology industry," said Adrian Bebb, a
   spokesman for the group.

   Associated Press correspondent Jonathan Fowler contributed to this
   report from Geneva.

Chiron's Suspension Extended

MedImmune Among Firms Rushing to Fill Vaccine Void

   By Michael S. Rosenwald
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Thursday, December 9, 2004; Page E01

   British regulators have extended their suspension of Chiron Corp.'s
   license to manufacture flu vaccine, jeopardizing the company's ability
   to sell millions of flu shots in the United States next flu season.

   The extended suspension announced late Tuesday means that Chiron,
   already blocked from shipping 48 million shots to the United States
   this year, may not be able to resume operations until at least April, a
   month after the company has indicated it needs to start production for
   the season that will begin next fall.

   "That's a clearly worrisome development," said Walter Orenstein, former
   director of the National Immunization Program at the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention.

   But continuing problems at California-based Chiron, which produces its
   vaccine in Great Britain, may be outweighed by the prospect that other
   companies from abroad will seek -- and win -- U.S. approval to sell
   their vaccines in the future.

   On Tuesday, the Bush administration gave emergency approval for
   GlaxoSmithKline PLC to sell its German-made vaccine this season. The
   administration said it will purchase 1.2 million doses, and the company
   said it could provide an additional 2.8 million doses if needed.

   GlaxoSmithKline, based in London, said yesterday that it is seeking
   priority review from the Food and Drug Administration for a permanent
   license beginning next flu season. If it wins approval, Glaxo intends
   to sell between 10 million and 20 million doses and could produce many
   more, said Patty Seif, a company spokeswoman.

   ID Biomedical Corp. of Vancouver said it also will seek a priority
   review for next year. Executives said they could produce at least 10
   million doses for the U.S. market. But the company acknowledged that
   approval might not come until 2007, as expected before this year's
   vaccine shortage. This week, ID Biomedical backed away from a plan to
   offer 1.2 million doses to the United States this season, reserving
   them for the Canadian government's stockpile.

   Aventis Pasteur, the nation's only other licensed flu shot provider,
   said yesterday that it could produce as many as 60 million doses, up
   from the 50 million it originally planned for this season and the 58
   million it was able to provide after the shortage emerged.

   The interest of Glaxo and ID Biomedical in jumping into the U.S. flu
   vaccine market may have been heightened by the federal government's
   response to the shortage, Orenstein said.

   He noted the government's increased willingness to buy unused flu
   shots, potentially stabilizing the market and reducing risk. Federal
   health officials persuaded Congress to earmark $100 million for a
   government effort to buy up unused vaccine next year. The money is in
   the omnibus spending bill that President Bush signed yesterday.

Marketer Sued for Do-Not-Call Violation

FTC Says Firm Called 300,000

   By Caroline E. Mayer
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, September 1, 2004; Page E03

   The Federal Trade Commission, seeking its first civil penalties against
   a telemarketer for violating the federal do-not-call list, has sued a
   Las Vegas firm, saying it called more than 300,000 numbers on the
   registry to sell time-share properties in Atlantic City.

   In a lawsuit filed Monday in a Nevada federal court, the agency said
   Braglia Marketing Group LLC also broke federal rules governing the use
   of automated dialers. If consumers answer such calls, they must be
   connected to a sales representative within two seconds.

   "This is a pretty simple case because our requirements are pretty
   clear. You can't call numbers on the registry. These people did," said
   Eileen Harrington, the agency's associate director for marketing
   practices. The agency's rules call for an $11,000 fine for each
   violation, making the potential liability in the case more than $3
   billion, an award that the commission is unlikely to obtain, agency
   officials said yesterday.

   Braglia is owned by husband and wife Frank and Kate Braglia. Frank
   Braglia has been marketing time-shares for a long time, said Andrea
   Hackman, editor-in-chief of the Timeshare Beat Inc., an online
   publication that monitors the industry.

   Sean Wilson, one of the Braglias' attorneys, said he would not comment
   on the lawsuit. Both he and FTC officials declined to say how large the
   Braglia call center was, although the agency said it was not among the
   nation's largest.

   "What this case demonstrates is that it doesn't take a huge company to
   generate an awful lot of telemarketing calls," Harrington said.

   In a Timeshare Beat online discussion last year, Frank Braglia was
   described as a "time-share marketing whiz" who had opened a
   state-of-the-art call center in Las Vegas. Hackman said Braglia "has a
   reputation within the industry for being very good at what he does and
   also for being willing to do whatever it takes to get the deal done."

   She added, "It's a tough business. Folks hope they won't get caught. .
   . . And if they do get caught, it is usually shrugged off as the price
   of doing business."

   More than 63 million telephone numbers have been registered on the
   national do-not-call list and more than 100,000 complaints have been
   filed at the FTC since enforcement began in October 2003.

   "As a general matter, compliance has been pretty good," Harrington
   said.

MedImmune Has A Higher Loss In Third Quarter

   By Michael S. Rosenwald
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, October 22, 2004; Page E05

   MedImmune Inc. reported a third-quarter loss yesterday, despite $61
   million in sales of its lead product, Synagis, a 25 percent increase
   over the same period a year ago.

   The Gaithersburg biotech company reported a third-quarter loss of $65
   million (26 cents a share), up from a loss of $16 million (7 cents) in
   the corresponding quarter a year ago.

   Revenue for the quarter was $93 million, down from $99 million last
   year, despite the increased sales of Synagis, which prevents certain
   viral infections in babies.

   MedImmune has become best known for FluMist, its nasal flu vaccine. The
   company said it expects an extra $10 million in revenue this flu season
   from FluMist because of the shortage of traditional flu shots.

   Before manufacturing problems wiped out about half of the U.S. vaccine
   supply, the company had said sales of the flu vaccine in spray form
   would not exceed 450,000 doses, the amount sold during last year's
   disastrous launch, which would have generated sales of about $35
   million to $45 million.

   During yesterday morning's conference call on its earnings, executives
   of the Gaithersburg company said they expect to sell 1 million to 2
   million doses this flu season. But late in the day, MedImmune chief
   executive David M. Mott appeared alongside Health and Human Services
   Secretary Tommy G. Thompson as he announced MedImmune now expects to
   produce 3 million doses for this flu season.

   Nonetheless, Mott said in an interview that he would not change the
   company's projection of $45 million to $57 million in sales, which was
   based on selling no more than 2 million doses. He cited uncertainty
   over how many additional doses will actually reach the marketplace.

   Regardless of the final sales figure, MedImmune made clear it expects
   FluMist to be a money-losing product this flu season. After cutting the
   price in half to $23.50 per dose, MedImmune would need to sell 6
   million to 8 million doses just to break even, Mott said in the
   conference call, and it's too late to produce that much.

   Earlier this year, MedImmune and pharmaceutical giant Wyeth ended a
   partnership to market FluMist. Expenses from dissolving the arrangement
   contributed to the quarterly losses.

   MedImmune's research and development costs soared from $54 million in
   last year's third quarter to $73 million this year for a new version of
   FluMist that it hopes could be marketed more broadly by 2007. The
   current vaccine is approved only for healthy people ages 5 to 49.

   Mott said the company is waiting for guidance on the vaccine market
   from federal health officials before deciding to increase production of
   FluMist for next year.

   Shares of MedImmune closed yesterday at $26.40, down 77 cents.

Mind Over Matter: Brain Waves Guide a Cursor's Path

Biomedical Engineers Create Devices That Turn Thoughts Into Action and Could
Help the Paralyzed Move Their Limbs

   By Rick Weiss
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Monday, December 13, 2004; Page A08

   Scott Hamel is a tough guy. In the gym, people stare in awe as he
   bench-presses more than 250 pounds. On the race track, he thinks
   nothing of taking his customized Corvette up toward the 200 mph mark.

   Yet twice a week or so, Hamel puts on an adorable red bonnet decorated
   with white polka dots and fastens its strap under his chin. He does so
   to exercise what has become the most powerful muscle in his body: his
   mind. With the help of that bonnet -- actually a high-tech piece of
   headgear that is wired to equipment developed by scientists in Albany,
   N.Y. -- Hamel has learned how to move a cursor around on a computer
   screen just by thinking about it.

                             ^_____Graphic^_____

   Hamel is one of four people whose techno-telepathic powers were
   highlighted last week in a scientific report that broke new ground in
   the rapidly advancing field of "brain-computer interfaces."
   Neuroscientists and biomedical engineers in that specialty have become
   increasingly adept at making devices that translate people's thoughts
   into actions -- a potential boon for paralyzed patients. But the newest
   and reputedly most promising of those systems have been dependent on
   wire electrodes implanted directly into the brain, presenting risks of
   infection and other complications.

   By contrast, the cap that Hamel has been test-driving picks up on brain
   waves emanating from his skull. With it, he can send computer cursors
   on various trajectories and zap targets as they appear on a screen,
   using nothing more than a series of mental impulses.

   "People have assumed you'd have to put electrodes in the brain to get
   this level of control," said lead researcher Jonathan Wolpaw, chief of
   the nervous system disorders lab at the state health department's
   Wadsworth Center. "But noninvasive methods can be a lot better than
   people have given them credit for."

   Wolpaw's "thinking cap" sports 64 sensors (the polka dots) that detect
   electroencephalographic (EEG) signals generated by neurons. With a
   software program analogous to those used in voice-recognition programs,
   which "learn" people's verbal quirks over time, people can gain control
   over a cursor's movement in two dimensions by modulating signal
   intensities in certain regions of the brain, Wolpaw and co-worker
   Dennis McFarland reported in last week's early online edition of the
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

   Hamel, for example, makes a cursor move up by getting his brain to
   generate strong 24 cycles-per-second signals in two areas of the
   sensorimotor cortex, the region that normally controls limb movements.
   Weakening that signal moves the cursor down. He pumps up a 12
   cycles-per-second signal on the right side of his brain and weakens the
   equivalent signal on the left to move the cursor right, and does the
   reverse to move it left.

   Of course, he is not thinking about brain-wave patterns any more than
   he does when brushing his teeth. He just tries to connect with the
   cursor.

   "It's like when a basketball player is in the zone," said Hamel, 43,
   who lives in Averill Park near Albany. "It's him and the ball and the
   basket, and there's no one else there. That's what it's like."

   After a few months of 30-minute training sessions four or five times a
   week, he and the three other volunteers were able to zap targets within
   a couple of seconds after they appeared at random spots on the screen.
   That suggests the technology may prove invaluable for quadriplegics and
   others lacking the ability to use their hands or voices.

   Hamel can empathize with them. He has been paralyzed below the chest
   since he was in a car crash at age 16 (one ironically unrelated to drag
   racing, which he was already dabbling in at the time). With his nervous
   system intact from the chest up, he does not need special technology to
   communicate or to use a computer. But out of personal interest and a
   desire to help others, he has worked with Wolpaw for years, since
   answering a call for volunteers posted at the gym.

   The degree of control that Hamel and others have attained impresses
   many scientists, but many suspect the technology will never match the
   results being obtained with electric leads in the brain.

   "EEG is fine if you only want to move a cursor," said Miguel Nicolelis,
   a Duke University researcher who has been implanting hundreds of
   electrodes into monkeys' brains, allowing them to operate robotic arms
   with their thoughts. "But to really restore motor function, to give
   mobility to a patient's own limbs, you need more control than that. You
   need to get into the brain."

   Dawn Taylor, a biomedical engineer at Case Western Reserve University
   and the Cleveland VA Medical Center, agrees. "The deeper you go into
   the brain, the better the recording quality and the more signal you can
   get out," Taylor said. She is developing a system to send brain signals
   to stimulators wired to paralyzed people's muscles, perhaps allowing
   them to use their limbs again by making those muscles twitch in
   coordinated fashion.

   Still, Taylor said, some people who might benefit from more invasive
   systems may settle for cruder EEG control. "A lot of people are just
   not going to agree to have stuff put in their head, and that's
   understandable. Different people have different tolerances for being
   the next cyborg," she said. "And for those who just want to communicate
   with a caregiver and work the computer, [EEG] is a good step forward."

   Implanted electrodes are already being tested in a few people. A device
   that packs 100 wire sensors in a pellet the size of a baby aspirin has
   been implanted in one patient and will soon go into four others under a
   Food and Drug Administration-approved study led by John Donoghue of
   Brown University and Cyberkinetics of Foxborough, Mass. That device is
   expected to allow disabled people to operate a computer and a robotic
   limb.

   Others, including neurobiologist Andrew Schwartz of the University of
   Pittsburgh School of Medicine, are focusing on translating brain
   patterns into seamless three-dimensional actions. "My goal is to get a
   prosthetic to work so it doesn't look like a robot moving but like a
   person moving, with all the agility of the human arm."

   If new computer programs can tell what a brain wants a cursor to do,
   can mind-reading technology be far behind?

   Don't hold your breath, Taylor advised. Fleeting thoughts are much more
   difficult to analyze than focused commands such as "Go up!" or "Go
   down!"

   Today's programs may detect brute-force commands, Taylor said, "but
   it's not like we're reading your deepest secrets here."

   Maybe not. But here is an EEG signal for any machine that might be
   trying: "MYOB!"

BearingPoint Warns of Continued Turmoil, Acknowledges Subpoena

   By Ellen McCarthy
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, December 17, 2004; Page E01

   BearingPoint Inc. disclosed more troubles yesterday, saying that it
   will take a restructuring charge of as much as $67 million and may not
   be able to report that it has adequate procedures in place to prevent
   accounting fraud.

   The McLean consulting firm also said it recently received a grand jury
   subpoena from the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California
   related to federal contracts dating to 1998, and that it will issue new
   debt that could reduce the value of shareholders' interest in the
   company.

   Investors yesterday drove the company's share price down 73 cents to
   $7.75.

   The disclosures, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
   Commission, followed the abrupt loss of two top executives in November.
   The company also is trying to deal with the future of several divisions
   whose performance has been disappointing.

   The company said it plans to use the proceeds of a $350 million
   convertible debt offering to replace an existing credit facility and
   repay existing debt.

   Soon after BearingPoint announced its offering, the company's credit
   was downgraded by rating agencies. Analysts said the convertible
   offering, which allows buyers to convert their notes into stock, could
   dilute BearingPoint's earnings per share and the ownership interest of
   current shareholders.

   The "dilutive event raises concerns that the business maybe more
   troubled than previously thought," said analysts from Wachovia
   Securities, which downgraded the company's stock to "underperform"
   yesterday.

   The offering is intended to give BearingPoint more liquidity, said Paul
   Hsi, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. But, he added, it will
   also increase its overall debt.

   "We've been tracking it very closely and have been sort of disappointed
   in terms of their ability to hit our expectations," Hsi said of the
   company.

   The offering would reduce the chances that BearingPoint might be
   declared in default of existing credit agreements. A default would be
   triggered if the company failed to file an audited financial statement,
   which might occur if it is unable to meet financial accounting
   standards under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The act requires companies to
   certify that they have adequate accounting controls in place to prevent
   fraud. BearingPoint said it found a "material weakness" in its
   accounting procedures as recently as Nov. 19, and will likely find at
   least one more by the end of the year.

   Thirty-five years ago, Apollo 11 landed on the moon - and Buzz Aldrin
   stepped into history as the second man to walk the lunar surface. James
   Cameron talked to him about that moment and the next step in manned
   space exploration.

   CAMERON: Every year that goes by makes the Apollo 11 landing even more
   stunning. Did you think about that trip as exploration or more like a
   military mission?
   ALDRIN: At the time, it felt like the beginning of something; it seemed
   pioneering. We were carrying out something; it was part of a bigger
   thing that you could call exploration, but the participation was really
   an operation. I was not that impressed with discovering something new.
   It was executing something and carrying it out.

   How much did you think or worry about the risk involved?
   You do what's in front of you, whether it was Apollo or flying
   airplanes into combat. You're not panicky about anything. You get into
   it. You do it. You have a certain amount of faith, and you charge
   ahead. It's not like you're calculating a risk or having concern about
   the consequences. You do the best you can and be as alert as possible -
   and calm and clear-headed in the midst of chaos.

   You do your job …
   Some people are more fortunate than others. And if you don't get shot
   down or blown up, you get selected for significant opportunities and
   all of a sudden you're a great hero for taking risks. And all you did
   was do what was in front of you.

   So you must have thought that the Apollo program would lead to more
   trips to the moon and eventually to Mars. Was there a sense that, being
   the first heroes, NASA wouldn't risk you on other missions?
   I felt it was greedy of anybody to take opportunities away from other
   people who were putting in a lot of time, who weren't as fortunate to
   be on the missions that got all the attention. And also, if there was
   risk involved, why go through that again? You don't have to face that.
   You just have to ease out.

   You've done a lot of work on Mars exploration - you've designed systems
   for getting there, published papers on how to pull off sustainable
   missions. Does it make sense to return to the moon in preparation for
   going to Mars?
   It really does. Going to Mars will take an enormous commitment, and
   going to the moon first can help that succeed. But that wouldn't
   justify supporting a permanent habitat with a large number of people on
   the moon; that doesn't make sense to me. The moon environment is in
   some ways more disadvantageous than Mars - there are temperature
   extremes, a total vacuum, you don't have wind storms, but you've got
   radiation.

   So does a habitat on Mars make sense?
   Absolutely. I think the financial commitment to send humans to Mars is
   so great that you shouldn't entertain it if you're only going to do it
   once or twice and then give up. It's hard to set up something that
   works there, then leave it and expect it to keep working between
   occasional visits. If something goes wrong, you have to get there to
   fix it. It will be dead for a long time. If we are going to make the
   investment, we ought to continue getting the return on the investment.
   That means establishing a growing permanence. It would be a tour of
   duty of about five years. You've got to face that going in.

   There won't be any problem getting people to sign up to go to Mars for
   five years. Hell, I'd go. In the meantime, NASA is talking about
   getting back on the moon within 15 years. How do you think you'll feel
   if humans return to the moon?
   I'd be very satisfied to be around. There's something about reaching
   that distance that's unique, a true distinction.

   Should lunar astronauts be in a special category?
   Twenty-four people have reached the moon. And half of them have walked
   on the moon - but you really don't want to differentiate between the
   two; you'd be short-changing people. But if you start including all the
   preparatory missions and on up the chain, you've got to include
   everybody - it becomes somewhat meaningless.

   Well I think there's an elite place for the 24 men.
   Only in literature, not in anything else. It doesn't receive
   recognition, and I've been frustrated by that.

   I have one fanboy question: When I look at the moon, I see it a certain
   way. Can you describe to me what you see? Aside from "been there, done
   that."
   I have a peculiar, particular attachment to it. The moon is pretty much
   as we see it from Earth until you get quite close. The one you see here
   is the one that we saw halfway there except it was maybe a little bit
   bigger. But then it rather quickly takes on another role. In orbit,
   descent, and touchdown - the closer you get - it's a different moon.

   What do you make of that experience now? Does it have a dreamlike
   quality? Or is it still a clear memory?
   Was it all a dream? No, it's reality. But it's brought back by certain
   scenes that are kind of stamped as impressions, isolated memories. Some
   of them are refreshed by photographs. When I look up there now, it's
   still the same moon. It's the moon we went to. But not the moon we
   walked on.

FireFox as a Security Risk Compared to IE? 174

   Posted by Cliff on Friday November 26, 2004 @05:20PM from the
   that's-just-silly-talk dept.
   A not-so anonymous Anonymous Coward asks: "The administrator at my work
   gave me the following reason for not using Mozilla. What do you think?
   'FireFox is a security risk. Please refrain from using it. Please
   continue to use IE 6.0. IE is our only supported browser. FireFox saves
   encrypted pages to disk and does not give you override capability. It
   also does not allow automatic cache clearing when closing a browser.
   These are security risks.'" Do any of you have information that could
   be used to contradict the administrators information on FireFox? Are
   there configuration options one can reach from about:config that a user
   can use to address the problem this administrator has cited?

       Turn off caching. In the configuration, privacy, cache set that to
       0, and caching is now disabled. Now, why anyone would claim that
       Mozilla/Firefox is less secure IE because of their own idocy should
       be shot.

            OMG, people write this stuff?
            Internet Explorer runs programs if you put them in an XML
            stylesheet, it runs programs supplied in bitmap images, allows
            websites to save scripts to disk and run them from the
            "trusted" zone, and allows any website to run activeX programs
            with full access to your computer if you ever click OK to a
            dialog box. These are security risks.

                 It would be better for a site like that to use a caching
                 proxy anyway. It puts all the effort on the server, and
                 off the desktops, and you have no problem keeping track
                 of what the desktops have stored on them, so if a desktop
                 machine gets stolen, no sensitive info is on it. This has
                 to be applied to other areas of their computing system as
                 well, of course, but it probably already is, because it's
                 really stupid to cache database results.
                 So, if you use a caching proxy instead of client-side
                 caching, you save bandwidth, you save space, you keep it
                 fast for the users, and you don't have to worry about
                 caching SSL pages on your user's machines.

            Also, you can make it essentially clear the cache on each
            browser exit by setting browser.cache.memory.enable to true
            and browser.cache.disk.enable to false.

                 Check out the Paranoia Button [mozdev.org]. It adds a
                 button to your toolbar that you can click and it clears
                 your history, browser cache, passwords, download history,
                 cookies, etc. You can do the same thing in options, but
                 if the black helicopters are right overhead, the Paranoia
                 Button is nice and quick.

                      What would be more useful (and currently not
                      possible) is a "be anonymous" button that when
                      pressed toggled the browser into a full privacy

       Use MSIE and access as many problem pages as you can so that you
       end up with a system filled with viruses, spyware, adware, popups
       and everything else until the machine slows to a crawl and then let

            That's a good way to get fired, seeing as how most of the

            There is a lot in this (especially with governments). I'm
            currently *trying* to persuade my uni have more free software
            on public machines starting with Firefox. I'll give some
            recent examples from my experience of this in relation to
            Firefox (as well as the obvious minor stuff like the
            government only producing documents in MSWord format or WWW
            sites that are in MSHTML so only work in MSIE):
              1. In my old (state) college (where I've just left) the
                 sysops told me (in person) that we were not allowed to
                 use Firefox because and I quote, "Firebird [as it was] is
                 a hacking [sic, should be cracking] tool like Kuzu [sic,
                 should be Kazaa]". They also denied that it was a WWW
                 browser and said that MSIE was the only WWW browser. They
                 also said that they have a policy of only using
                 Microsoft's software on the PCs.
              2. A friend of mine uninstalled Firefox because his ISP told
                 him that they did not support their users connecting to
                 the WWW using Firefox. They also told him that just using
                 MSIE (without uninstalling Firefox) instead would not
                 work as Firefox also stops MSIE from connecting to the
                 Internet when it is installed. (The same ISP also said
                 that they only allow their users to check their email
                 with Outlook Express and that my friend should not
                 install any other mail client.)
            I could go on...

                 It could be worse. Your government could demand that all
                 tax returns be filed electronically, make it illegal to
                 not file electronically, and then create a website for
                 filing so that it can't be used on non-Internet Explorer
                 browsers [theregister.co.uk]
                 Of course, no real government would ever be that

       I think I'm going to have to call bullshit on your admistrator.
       In about:config, the property you want to look for is:
       browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl
       From This Page: [lockergnome.com]
       * Description: switch to enable caching of objects served over a
       secure connection (SSL).
       * Type: boolean
       * Default: false
       * Recommendation: true on systems where it is secure to cache these
       objects.
       By default, Firefox (and Mozilla. and Netscape.) will *NOT* cache
       SSL-served pages. And, contrary to your administrator's *other*
       claim, you most certainly *can* toggle this behaviour in Firefox.

                 How does Firefox prevent them from patching Windows
                 software?
                 It doesn't. It's just an excuse for lazy MCSE admins who
                 don't want to add an additional step to their daily
                 advisory-reading / patch-installing cycle.
                 My point is this: in an established MS shop, it's often
                 very hard to get the admins to approve usage of non-MS
                 software. At my previous job we had many people using MS
                 Publisher and that MS photo suite when InDesign and
                 Photoshop would have been far better for their needs.
                 I'm not agreeing with the original poster's admin, I'm
                 just saying that MS shops are often set in their ways.

                      Not just MS admins. Every admin I've ever
                      encountered has been as loathe to have his daily
                      routine altered, regardless of whether the shop used
                      MS or not.
                      Imagine the reaction if someone working in an
                      all-Unix shop decides they want to run IE.

       While your admin may have issues with the default configuration for
       Firefox, there are genuine reasons for not deploying firefox to
       your network. Most security concious organisations have a very
       rigourous patching system for the authorised applications and
       operating systems. Any app which doesn't fit into that patching
       system (whether it be up2date, apt-get, SUS/WUS/SMS, yum or another
       flavour) presents a massive overhead to the IT team. Every time
       there is an update to Firefox, it needs to be repackaged and
       redeployed to every desktop in your organisation. And it's not just
       Firefox, but by setting a precedent of deploying MyRequestedAppX,
       they face pressure from all sides for AppY, AppZ, etc. Then the
       questions come - "you support Mr X's AppX with updates and patches
       - why not mine?".
       Unless your organisation has the infrastructure to deal with
       non-baseline application patching, those apps WILL present a
       security risk while the IT team tries to find the resource to
       patch/update and deploy the latest version.

                           take on untested patches ;^) (even the Linux

            Could not agree more.
            Custom application standardisation across the install base
            means that issue resolution can be standardised and tweaked to
            meet the response/support requirement. The certification and
            testing processes that most serious companies use to pass apps
            as fitting are both rigourous and not condusive to
            incorporating the latest 'app du jour'. And rightly so.
            It's easy for tech saavy folks to deem these practices as a
            symptom of the narrow mindedness of lazy MCSE admins (who
            would appear to be some sort of subspecies of a real admins).
            It's easy to see this as an organisation being inflexible due
            to undereducation but I believe that that is not the case. A
            pestered admin will often give the sort of pseudo answer this
            user recieved.It's not good to fudge that way , but without
            taking a user step by step through the security policies and
            application certification documetnation, it's difficult to
            explain the why of decisions such as this.
            It can be difficult to meet the job function requirements of
            diverse departments and maintain the steady balancing act that
            will ensure your SourceSafe users will be as compliant as the
            receptionist.
            For this organisation it may be useful to do a business case
            analysis exploring the usefulness or otherwise of Firefox but
            as it is still in it's first iteration a lot of companies will
            be loathe to abandon the practices they have in place on a
            whim.
            Aa firefox moves ever closer to a dominant position the
            pressure will become greater and things will change. It will
            also become more a target and I'm betting that this
            [secunia.com] will begin getting longer and looking far more
            serious as more and more authors start realising the potential
            success to be had in taking Firefox on.

       What your system admin says is true. But consider this: with
       Firefox, one would probably have to have physical access to your
       machine to make any use of the information Firefox stores. With IE,
       one only needs to "reach out and touch you" using a malicious
       webpage or email.
       IMHO, Firefox is more of a local security risk that could expose
       your sensitive data to others who use your computer. IE, OTOH,
       could expose your data to anyone on the internet.

       Your admin's claims, as others have noted, are BS.
       However, one reason I haven't rolled out Firefox across the board
       here is because it's a pain to centrally distribute, update and
       administer.
       A word to the Firefox devs - if you really want to start making an
       impact into the corporate world:
       Make centralised admin of Firefox under Windows easy and standard
       with GPOs (or even for just a start, obey the system-wide settings
       for things like homepages and proxies).
       Package it into an MSI.
       On a more personal note, fix the damn copy and paste bug that's
       been hanging around since (at least) the Firefox 0.7 days. It
       doesn't stop me using it (or recommending it to others), but it
       *does* make it EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING sometimes.

                 For people at any sane shop. I have local Admin rights on
                 my laptop, as I need to install s/w. As a result, I have
                 disabled much of the IT spyware that your profile loads.
                 The result? When AD blows up, or Novell NDS-AD bridge
                 goes down, I can still get on locally. The fact that you
                 speak so readily of needing to "go with the flow" and
                 wistfully of the "Aeron chairs" and "foosball" table tell
                 me that your experience was markedly different, perhaps
                 due to our differing skillsets and attitudes. Sorry for
                 your loss.

     We (normal people, non-telecom companies) don't fire people for
     installing essential software.
                      Sorry, but Firefox does not qualify as essential
                      software. IE, as provided by the IT department,
                      provides approximately the same functionality.
                      Perhaps Firefox is more secure, but since everybody
                      else there runs IE, what difference does it make?
                      As for why they don't allow Firefox, it's probably
                      that they don't want to support it. With XP, IE,
                      Outlook and Office on everybody's desktop, with some
                      relatively simple tools, they can update everybody
                      at once. So in theory, they should be able to keep
                      up on patches and such, and keep it as secure as
                      possible (as MS software ever is, anyways.)
                      When people start installing their own software,
                      then that either adds more things for IT to support,
                      or adds things that IT does not update. If it's the
                      latter, then it's possible that a hole will appear
                      in Firefox that does not exist in IE, and the
                      company could be compromised that way. (Yes, if the
                      hole appears in IE, the company is compromised that
                      way. But they like to limit the number of
                      vulnerabilities.)
                      I'm not saying this attitude is correct, but it's
                      pretty pervasive. When IT tells you to not do
                      something, and you do it anyways, that's the sort of
                      thing that can get you fired at many places, or at

                      of layoffs ...
                      (For the record, I work in a land of Microsoft
                      software, but I do run Linux (and the assorted
                      applications that go with it) on my boxes at work.
                      And I even have permission to do so -- but it
                      certainly wasn't easy to get. But at least I know I
                      won't get fired for it. (Ultimately, I was told to
                      stop, and so I pushed for official permission rather
                      than stop.))

            If they use a system like M$'s Systems Management Server
            [microsoft.com], they can create an automated query for
            Firefox binaries that will inform them of who has it

            schedule of the individual machine's SMS agent.
            I think there would be a Control Panel called "Advertised
            Packages" on your machine if this was in use. There is
            another, but I'm not certain what it's called; it would show

            check in.

   Symbol launches new Pocket PC with wireless LAN
   Posted on 20-Oct-2004 07:18. | Tags Filed under: News : Windows Phone
   : Windows Mobile Pocket PC.

               Symbol launches new Pocket PC with wireless LAN

   Symbol Technologies, Inc. has introduced the first in a new family of
   what they call durable enterprise digital assistant (EDA) products
   specifically designed for business essential applications within the
   enterprise environment. Targeting the growing mobile enterprise market,
   the new Symbol MC50 was created for mobile workers within organizations
   that are seeking to capture, move and manage information at the point
   of business activity in order to increase productivity and efficiency,
   while improving customer responsiveness and satisfaction.
   The Symbol MC50 incorporates Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 Second
   Edition and integrated Wi-Fi (802.11b wireless LAN) networking. The
   MC50, which features industry-standard-based and Symbol wireless
   security capabilities, also includes integrated voice capability with
   an optimized-for-voice electrical and mechanical design. With the MC50,
   voice over IP (VoIP) solutions can be deployed enabling in-building and
   on-campus communications for real-time responses and improved customer
   satisfaction. It comes with a transflective color TFT-LCD, 65K colors,
   240x320 pixels (QVGA size), SDIO slot for SD or MMC cards. It's based
   on an Intel XScale CPU @ 520MHz, with 64MB SDRAM and 64MB ROM.
   "The business case for an enterprise digital assistant is found in the
   productivity increases that come from giving workers secure
   connectivity to corporate data regardless of their location," said
   Kevin Burden, program manager of mobile devices at IDC. "Organizations
   moving towards mobile application enablement are growing more strict in
   their requirements, and will increasingly look only to devices that
   fulfill the security, manageability and functional demands of their
   applications."
   The MC50 enterprise device is ideal for mobile professionals who are
   not working at a desk or stationary location and need real-time access
   to people and information while they are on the move. Equipped with
   integrated wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) connectivity and data capture options,
   including 1D and 2D bar code scanning and image capture or one
   megapixel color camera configurations, the MC50 is designed for
   in-facility, real-time communication, data capture and VoIP telephony,
   enabling decision making at the point of activity.
   Control and management of mobile devices on the corporate network are
   major concerns among IT managers and executive decision makers and
   Symbol directly addresses these concerns by providing the ability to
   completely manage the MC50 through Symbol's Mobility Services Platform
   (MSP). Symbol's MSP is an integrated solution that provides unified
   enterprise-wide management of mobile devices and wireless network
   infrastructure.
   The Symbol MC50 can be equipped with an MSP agent that will collect and
   monitor device performance information and then deliver status in
   real-time to a centralized Symbol MSP console. This feature will help
   customers better address the growing challenges associated with rolling
   out, managing and maintaining enterprise mobility systems. With the
   MSP, enterprise operations personnel can rapidly deploy new devices,
   like the MC50, provision software upgrades and fixes with a single
   command, as well as perform remote user support and diagnostics.

   Nokia announces Near Field Communication products

              Nokia announces Near Field Communication products

   With the Nokia NFC (Near Field Communication) shell on their phone,
   consumers will be able to access a variety of services and exchange
   information with a simple touch gesture.
   The Nokia NFC shell offers consumers access to browsing, and text
   message services simply by touching tags that contain service
   shortcuts. Consumers are also able to give their favorite service
   shortcuts to other users by touching another NFC-compatible device with
   their phone. In addition, the Nokia NFC shell comes with tags that can
   be used for creating own personal service shortcuts.
   The NFC technology evolved from a combination of contactless
   identification (RFID) and interconnection technologies. NFC operates in
   the 13.56 MHz frequency range, over a distance of typically a few
   centimetres. NFC technology is standardized in ISO 18092, ISO 21481,
   ECMA (340, 352 and 356) and ETSI TS 102 190. NFC is also compatible to
   contactless smart card infrastructure based on ISO 14443 A, i.e.
   Philips MIFARE technology, as well as Sony's FeliCa card.
   The first mobile phone to work with the new Nokia NFC is the Nokia 3220
   (pictured), a tri-band camera phone that is available in two versions:
   a GSM 900/1800/1900 primarily for the European and Asian markets, and a
   GSM 850/1800/1900 primarily for the Americas. The Nokia NFC shell is a
   functional cover developed for the Nokia 3220 phone. The Nokia NFC
   shell with four tags will be available during the first quarter of 2005
   in Europe, and during the second quarter 2005 in the Americas and Asia.

   Genesis at Lockheed Martin - 2

   Large sections of the Genesis Sample Return Capsule in Lockheed
   Martin's facilities in Denver, Colo.
   Large sections of the Genesis Sample Return Capsule that survived the
   hard impact landing in the Utah desert Sept. 8 were shipped to Lockheed
   Martin's facilities in Denver, Colo. and arrived Sept. 22. Members of
   the Genesis team and the Mishap Investigation Board have begun the
   process of closely inspecting and analyzing the capsule and the systems
   onboard to identify clues as to why the parachutes were not deployed
   from the capsule following re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.
   Meanwhile, members of the Genesis science team continue their
   meticulous work in a clean room at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground
   as they collect and secure the science canister and sample materials
   that were brought back in the capsule. Optimism continues to grow as
   the science team believes that a significant repository of solar wind
   materials survived the hard landing and has been recovered.

High-Def DVD Formats Fight for Dominance

   High-Def DVD Formats Fight for Dominance

   "We've been through the digital revolution in many ways already -- from
   LPs to compact discs and from VHS to DVD," says Jeff Joseph of the
   Consumer Electronics Association. "High definition is an important step
   forward, and we expect to see high-definition consumer products by the
   fourth quarter of next year, even though there are competing formats
   now."
   By Tina Harlan
   Dec 7, 2004 11:52 AM PT

   If you're already confused by the proliferation of digital music types
   and don't know the difference between a DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD-RW, get
   ready for the next assault. The good news is that digital television
   and the resulting high-definition DVD technology will be a vast
   improvement over the images we typically see on TV today. The bad news
   is that once again there is no standardized format, so compatibility
   remains an issue.

   Hollywood studios, however, are beginning to take sides. Toshiba's
   next-generation technology, known as HD DVD, is the format of choice
   for Warner Bros. Studios, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and
   New Line Cinema. Meanwhile, Sony, Dell and Samsung, among others, favor
   Blu-ray, a competitive technology. As one might expect, Blu-ray has the
   backing of Sony Pictures, and in all likelihood, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
   which has recently been acquired by a group led by Sony. Twentieth
   Century Fox is also thought to be in this camp.

Array of Formats

   Both technologies use blue lasers, which allow discs to store data at
   the densities necessary for high definition. Since Congress has
   mandated that television stations in the United States switch to
   digital broadcasting, many DVD players and recorders will have to be
   replaced. Royalties from licensing the technology will further sweeten
   an already lucrative pot. DVD equipment is currently a US$10 billion a
   year market.

   "We've been through the digital revolution in many ways already -- from
   LPs to compact discs and from VHS to DVD," says Jeff Joseph, vice
   president of communications for the Consumer Electronics Association.
   "High definition is an important step forward, and we expect to see
   high definition consumer products by the fourth quarter of next year,
   even though there are competing formats now."

   Such an array of confusing choices means that consumers will have to do
   their homework. According to Joseph, "the marketplace often determines
   the surviving format. Another thing that happens is that formats that
   start off as incompatible become compatible, such as we've seen with
   CDs and SACDs [Super Audio Compact Discs]. You'll begin to see
   dual-format players or equipment that can playback a wide variety of
   formats."

Issues at Hand

   In addition, Toshiba and Memory-Tech have announced a dual-layer DVD
   they claim can play both on today's equipment and on high-definition
   players.

   "Manufacturers are going to protect the legacy of their devices because
   no one wants angry consumers," predicts Joseph. "The big issue will be
   copy protection and how it's handled."

   With Hollywood studios concerned about losing profits to illegal
   distribution over the Internet, and consumers demanding the right to
   make legal copies for their own use, the protection issue is one more
   issue yet to be resolved.

Changing Landscape

   Television stations will continue to provide analog programming until
   the end of 2006, and probably beyond. The date is likely to be extended
   until a majority of U.S. homes are able to receive the digital signal.
   Even when analog broadcasting ends, you'll still be able to get a
   signal on older sets by purchasing a digital-to-analog converter box.
   Cable companies are also likely to offer the decoding as an additional
   feature of their converter boxes.

   In the meantime, the FCC has established a Web site to help consumers
   who want to learn more about the coming changes.

   And if you're thinking about a new television for the holidays, Joseph
   has some advice. "Don't buy a regular TV today, because analog
   broadcasting will end sometime within the next five years. Buy HDTV
   instead." Since the digital sets generally have wider, more rectangular
   screens, he said, "Be sure to measure before you buy." [end-enn.gif]

High-Def DVD Formats Fight for Dominance

   High-Def DVD Formats Fight for Dominance

   "We've been through the digital revolution in many ways already -- from
   LPs to compact discs and from VHS to DVD," says Jeff Joseph of the
   Consumer Electronics Association. "High definition is an important step
   forward, and we expect to see high-definition consumer products by the
   fourth quarter of next year, even though there are competing formats
   now."
   By Tina Harlan
   Dec 7, 2004 11:52 AM PT

   If you're already confused by the proliferation of digital music types
   and don't know the difference between a DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD-RW, get
   ready for the next assault. The good news is that digital television
   and the resulting high-definition DVD technology will be a vast
   improvement over the images we typically see on TV today. The bad news
   is that once again there is no standardized format, so compatibility
   remains an issue.

   Hollywood studios, however, are beginning to take sides. Toshiba's
   next-generation technology, known as HD DVD, is the format of choice
   for Warner Bros. Studios, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and
   New Line Cinema. Meanwhile, Sony, Dell and Samsung, among others, favor
   Blu-ray, a competitive technology. As one might expect, Blu-ray has the
   backing of Sony Pictures, and in all likelihood, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
   which has recently been acquired by a group led by Sony. Twentieth
   Century Fox is also thought to be in this camp.

Array of Formats

   Both technologies use blue lasers, which allow discs to store data at
   the densities necessary for high definition. Since Congress has
   mandated that television stations in the United States switch to
   digital broadcasting, many DVD players and recorders will have to be
   replaced. Royalties from licensing the technology will further sweeten
   an already lucrative pot. DVD equipment is currently a US$10 billion a
   year market.

   "We've been through the digital revolution in many ways already -- from
   LPs to compact discs and from VHS to DVD," says Jeff Joseph, vice
   president of communications for the Consumer Electronics Association.
   "High definition is an important step forward, and we expect to see
   high definition consumer products by the fourth quarter of next year,
   even though there are competing formats now."

   Such an array of confusing choices means that consumers will have to do
   their homework. According to Joseph, "the marketplace often determines
   the surviving format. Another thing that happens is that formats that
   start off as incompatible become compatible, such as we've seen with
   CDs and SACDs [Super Audio Compact Discs]. You'll begin to see
   dual-format players or equipment that can playback a wide variety of
   formats."

Issues at Hand

   In addition, Toshiba and Memory-Tech have announced a dual-layer DVD
   they claim can play both on today's equipment and on high-definition
   players.

   "Manufacturers are going to protect the legacy of their devices because
   no one wants angry consumers," predicts Joseph. "The big issue will be
   copy protection and how it's handled."

   With Hollywood studios concerned about losing profits to illegal
   distribution over the Internet, and consumers demanding the right to
   make legal copies for their own use, the protection issue is one more
   issue yet to be resolved.

Changing Landscape

   Television stations will continue to provide analog programming until
   the end of 2006, and probably beyond. The date is likely to be extended
   until a majority of U.S. homes are able to receive the digital signal.
   Even when analog broadcasting ends, you'll still be able to get a
   signal on older sets by purchasing a digital-to-analog converter box.
   Cable companies are also likely to offer the decoding as an additional
   feature of their converter boxes.

   In the meantime, the FCC has established a Web site to help consumers
   who want to learn more about the coming changes.

   And if you're thinking about a new television for the holidays, Joseph
   has some advice. "Don't buy a regular TV today, because analog
   broadcasting will end sometime within the next five years. Buy HDTV
   instead." Since the digital sets generally have wider, more rectangular
   screens, he said, "Be sure to measure before you buy." [end-enn.gif]

   The new Apple TV means the end of TV as we know it...
   (_) True -- the cable industry's reign is about to end.
   (_) Not really -- apps didn't kill the Internet, and they won't kill
   TV.
   (_) Kind of true -- but it's the Internet, not Apple, that's changing
   TV.
   (_) Not so much -- the cable companies still have a lock on content.
   (_) False -- most people will stick with what they know best.

   Spending more on security doesn't necessarily make you more secure,
   Gartner warned yesterday.

   The analyst firm forecasts that information security spending will drop
   from an average six-to-nine per cent of IT budgets to between four and
   five per cent as organisations improve security management and
   efficiency. Victor Wheatman, Gartner security veep, told delegates at
   the IT Security Summit in London that the most secure organisations
   spend less than the average and that the lowest spending organisations
   are the most secure. The businesses can safely reduce the share of
   security in their overall IT budget to three or four per cent by 2006,
   he said.

   The idea that the most secure organisations spend the most on security
   was among a number of myths debunked by Wheatman during a keynote
   before approximately 700 delegates at the Gartner IT security Summit
   yesterday. He also attacked the popular misconception that "software
   has to have flaws". Wheatman said this is true only if enterprises
   continue to buy flawed software, and he singled Microsoft out for
   particular criticism.

   He described Windows as “the biggest beta test in history" and warned
   warned IT security pros not to expect too much from Microsoft’s vaunted
   Trustworthy Computing initiative. "Microsoft will try, and there'll be
   improvement with Longhorn, but it will not solve all your security
   problems - no matter what the richest man in the world says,” he said.
   According to Gartner better quality assurance of software is needed
   before it goes into production. If 50 per cent of vulnerabilities are
   removed prior to software being put in production then incident
   response costs would be reduced by 75 per cent, it estimates.

   Gartner has identified IT security technologies enterprises will need
   over the next five years - and other technologies most companies
   probably won't need. On the enterprise shopping list is host-based
   intrusion prevention, identity management, 802.1X authentication and
   gateway spam and AV scanning. Security technologies Gartner reckons
   most companies can safely do without include personal digital
   signatures, biometrics, enterprise digital rights management and
   500-page security policies. ®

   Warner, Paramount, Universal and New Line Cinema have all agreed to
   issue movies in the upcoming HD DVD format, the disc's co-creator,
   Toshiba, said today.

   The four represent 45 per cent of the major studios' DVD output in the
   US, the Japanese giant said.

   Pre-recorded HD DVDs are at least a year away, but with Sony
   aggressively pushing its rival high-capacity optical disc format,
   Blu-ray, Toshiba clearly feels it has to follow suit.

   Both technologies boost the capacity of the 12cm disc by using a blue
   laser to read the data off the carrier rather than the red laser
   today's DVD systems use. Blue light's shorter wavelength means that the
   'spots' on the disc's surface used to encode digital data can be
   smaller. In turn, smaller spots means more of them in a given area - a
   higher capacity, in other words.

   Blu-ray wins on the capacity front, offering 25GB on a single-layer
   disc to HD DVD's 20GB and a more aggressive roadmap to increase that
   capacity over time. The downside is the need for entirely new disc
   production lines. HD DVD, by contrast, only needs existing DVD pressing
   rigs to be retooled rather than replaced. It also has the strength of
   the DVD brand, which has been very strongly pushed to consumers over
   the last seven years or so.

   And now the format has clear studio backing. But so does Blu-ray, with
   Sony almost certainly offering content on the medium, and possibly MGM
   - recently acquired by Sony - and 20th Century Fox, too. ®

     * Bad news everyone: Cybercrime is getting even easier

   Britain's top cybercrime fighters have joined up with the banking
   industry today in warning of the latest attempt to defraud online
   banking customers. The attacks, in the form of 'Trojan horse' emails,
   have been spammed out to a number of email account holders randomly
   across the country. The emails contain links to malicious websites in
   North America and China. The UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU)
   is working with the Internet industry to have these sites shut down. At
   the time of writing three have been taken out of commission but others
   remain active.

   NHTCU and banking organisation APACS have teamed up to warn on the
   threat in a highly unusual move that underlines the seriousness of the
   risk. An NHTCU spokeswoman explained: "This is really vicious. It's
   just a normal phishing attack but something that tries to install
   backdoors on victims' PCs".

Touch of Evil

   The spam emails contain details of a fictitious order for Web hosting
   or computer goods and thank the email recipient for a non-existent
   order. In addition, they also display the apparent cost that will be
   charged to their credit card. The email also contains a link to one of
   a number of maliciously constructed website in order to "view the order
   in more detail". If an email recipient is duped into visiting one of
   these sites, it appears merely as a site under construction. But in the
   background malign actions are afoot designed to load a variant of the
   Mitglieder proxy Trojan onto vulnerable Windows boxes.

   These maliciously constructed sites harbour a Trojan downloader routine
   capable of dropping a keystroke logging program onto vulnerable PCs.
   This exploit is possible because of well-known Windows security bugs,
   namely an MHTML URL vulnerability (MS04-013) and an ADODB.Stream
   vulnerability. Both of thses flaws can be fixed by the latest Internet
   Explorer megapatch (MS04-025).

   If a machine becomes infected, the next time a customer uses their PC
   to access their own online banking site, the Trojan can potentially
   record their secret passwords and PINs used to log-on. This information
   is accessible to attackers thereby compromising the security of
   victim's online banking accounts. In addition, the Trojan surrenders
   control of the machine to attackers. It's unclear how many users have
   been hit by the attack.

Protect and survive

   Although the threat from Trojans is a serious one if precautions and
   advice are not taken, the banking industry offers a number of security
   measures to defend against these types of attack. These include partial
   passwords, so not all characters from a password are revealed at any
   one time. This is further enhanced by the use of drop-down lists, which
   rely on the use of a mouse to select alphabetic or numerical
   characters. In addition, some banks also offer customers the
   opportunity to purchase reduced-price security software via their
   websites.

   Sandra Quinn, Director of Corporate Communications at APACS, said: "By
   being wary of unsolicited emails and maintaining basic security
   measures on your computer you can go online with confidence."

   APACS refers consumers to its previously published guidelines on safe
   computing.

   Detective Chief Superintendent Len Hynds, Head of the NHTCU said: "The
   NHTCU is continuing to work hard to bring the perpetrators of these
   elaborate scams to justice. The criminals behind these attacks are
   constantly evolving their techniques and changing tactics to target a
   wider range of victims. With this range of exploits being blended in
   one piece of code, it is not just about online banking. There is a
   second keylogger and a program that allows the machine to act as a mail
   proxy that could be used by spammers. It is the Swiss Army knife of the
   cyber-criminal." ®

Photo may be first of extrasolar planet

    The red object appears to be a planet orbiting the brighter (but still
                relatively dim) brown dwarf star, seen here as blue-white.

   (SPACE.com) -- A group of European-led astronomers has made a
   photograph of what appears to be a planet orbiting another star. If so,
   it would be the first confirmed picture of a world beyond our solar
   system.

   "Although it is surely much bigger than a terrestrial-size object [like
   Earth], it is a strange feeling that it may indeed be the first
   planetary system beyond our own ever imaged," said Christophe Dumas, an
   astronomer at the European Southern Observatory.

   SPACE.com revealed a similar imaging effort of another planet candidate
   in May by a U.S.-led team that used the Hubble Space Telescope. That
   possible planet has not been confirmed and could be a dim star in the
   background of the picture. Otherwise, all of the more than 120 known
   extrasolar planets have been detected indirectly, by noting the shadow
   of a planet crossing in front of a star or a planet's gravitational
   effect on a star.

   Because planets are so dim compared to stars, technology has not been
   able to spot them amid stellar glare. That is, perhaps, until now.

   The new picture shows a dim, red point of light that Dumas and his
   colleagues think is a young, giant planet similar to Jupiter. It orbits
   a failed star known as a brown dwarf, a very dim type of star -- its
   core does not support nuclear fusion -- that astronomers have for years
   hoped would make for good planet hunting. The brown dwarf, catalogued
   as 2M1207, is 42 times less massive than the sun, or some 25 times
   heftier than Jupiter.

   The objects are 230 light-years away.

   The possible planet is about five times as massive as Jupiter, the
   observations show. An analysis of its emissions found it contains
   water, which suggests its mass is in the range of planets rather than
   stars, the researchers announced today.

   The object is still contracting into its final form and so is very
   warm, some 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius), according to the
   research team, which was led by ESO's Gael Chauvin.

   The photograph was made at ESO's Paranal Observatory in Chile with an
   infrared camera, which records heat rather than visible light. A system
   of adaptive optics on the Very Large Telescope (it's 27 feet wide, or
   8.2 meters) corrects for blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere, making
   detailed observations possible.

   The discovery will be detailed in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

   If it is a planet, the object orbits 55 times farther from the brown
   dwarf than Earth is from the sun, or roughly twice the Earth-to-Neptune
   distance.

   The remaining question, however, is whether the thing might instead be
   a star that's in the foreground or background and not gravitationally
   bound to the brown dwarf, a scenario the researchers say is
   "statistically very improbable."

   Additional observations to monitor the movement of the two objects will
   reveal the answer within two years, the astronomers say.

   Oracle's proposed takeover of Peoplesoft has hit another barrier. A
   Delaware judge has delayed his final ruling over Peoplesoft's poison
   pill defence, saying that he needs to hear more evidence.

   Judge Leo Strine said he wanted to hear why the Peoplesoft board had
   rejected Oracle's most recent bid of $24 per share. Peoplesoft's
   shareholders have voted to accept the bid, but the board rejected it.
   It says it will not sell the company for less than it is worth, and
   that the current bid undervalues the company.

   In its defence against Oracle's hostile takeover bid, Peoplesoft
   promised to give its customers rebates worth between two and five times
   their licensing fees, in the event of a takeover. The deal, which
   represents a liability of at least $800m, would begin if the company is
   bought in the next two years, and if support for product lines is
   reduced within four years.

   Oracle wants the court to overturn the measures. In its suit, it claims
   that the measures are unlawful because then-CEO Craig Conway misled
   investors.

   The Delaware court is thought unlikely to overturn the Peoplesoft
   board. Which leaves Oracle with the much more time-consuming and
   expensive option of a proxy battle to gain seats on the board.
   Yesterday, Oracle announced that will nominate four candidates for
   election to Peoplesoft's Board of Directors. That vote will take place
   at PeopleSoft's 2005 annual stockholders meeting.

   Jeff Henley, Oracle's Chairman of the Board said: "We believe that the
   current board of PeopleSoft is not acting in the best interests of
   stockholders and that a large majority of those stockholders are in
   favor of a change."

   Judge Strine has pencilled the hearing in for 13 or 14 December, but
   declined to say when he would make his final ruling. ®

   Napster UK today continued its pursuit of lesser net-worth individuals
   than arch-rival Apple is chasing by signing a deal to sell its music
   download vouchers in papershops and convenience stores throughout the
   nation.

   Over 1000 McColl's, Martin's, Forbuoys, RS McColl and Dillons shops,
   all part of the TM Retail group, will stock Napster Music Vouchers from
   today. Green vouchers provide two and four months' access to Napster's
   £10-a-month subscription service for £20 and £35, respectively. Blue
   vouchers costing £10, £20 and £30 can be used, respectively, for ten,
   22 and 33 one-off downloads.

   The TM Retail deal comes after Napster vouchers went on sale earlier
   this month throughout the UK's chain of around 15,500 loss-making Post
   Offices and, in October, through Dixons Group's more profitable Dixons,
   Currys, PC World and The Link shops. All these generally target
   demographic groups not traditionally seen a big music customers.

   Napster sees such chains as a key way of attracting consumers without
   credit cards - much as Inspired Broadcast Networks is gearing its
   digital music vending machines at the cash economy. But with the
   digital music market being driven by device purchases rather than the
   other way round, it's questionable how many owners of pricey MP3
   players are going to prefer buying songs via the Post Office or a
   newsagent than online.

   "For those who may be unfamiliar with the Internet or perhaps don't
   have a credit card, Napster vouchers offer a very easy route to the
   Napster service," said Napster UK chief Leanne Sharman. The trouble is,
   surely, online music sales demand a considerable familiarity with the
   Internet? ®

   France has been crowned Europe's LLU leader, according to the latest
   data from the European Competitive Telecommunications Association
   (ECTA).

   With around three-quarters of a million unbundled lines, France has
   recently overtaken Germany as Europe's top nation for local loop
   unbundling (LLU).

   ECTA - a pan-European trade association serving the telecoms industry -
   reports that France only began opening up the incumbent's telephone
   exchanges to competition in 2002. Once the conditions are right for
   LLU, it argues, it can lead to a number of new services such as TV over
   broadband and internet telephony.

   Said ECTA's Roger Wilson: "The French case demonstrates how joined up
   efforts by the national regulator and the EU and national competition
   authorities to promote a level playing field have created an
   environment that enables progress up the 'ladder of investment' and
   further innovation by alternative operators and independent ISPs."

   In contrast, the UK only has a measly 13,000 unbundled lines although
   the Telecom Markets' Broadband Subscriber Database (BSD) reckons that
   this figure could explode to more than 800,000 by 2008.

   As the cost of LLU falls in the UK and a number of operators - recently
   NTL and Cable & Waireless - have pledged to invest in opening up BT's
   network, reearchers at BSD reckon the take-up of unbundled services
   will rocket over the coming years.

   By 2008, it's predicted that more than eight million people in the UK
   will be hooked up to broadband with around one in ten subscribing by
   LLU.

   This month the UK passed another important milestone by notching up
   five million broadband punters. Of those, three million access the net
   using a dsl connection with the rest made up of cable connections.

   "With some 50,000 new subscribers joining every week, the five million
   barrier was breached in mid-September", says Gareth Willmer, analyst
   for BSD. ®

   Reg review Some market watchers say that mobile phones will eventually
   supersede standalone MP3 players. Creative's latest device certainly
   anticipates such a move, in design if not functionality. If ever there
   was a digital music player that looks and feels like a handset, it's
   the Zen Micro (ZM). With it's compact size, gently curvaceous casing
   and one-thumb operation, it's hard not to bring the ZM up to your ear
   and start nattering.

   Creative Zen Micro It's all about competing with Apple's iPod Mini,
   rather than phones, of course. While Creative hardware developers have
   focused solely on technology, they've come up with good but by and
   large plain devices. The Zen Touch was the company's first attempt the
   iPod's savoir faire, but lacked the looks and inflicted a complex,
   11-button control system on anyone who tried to use it. The ZM is a big
   step forward. Not only is it something of a looker, it's far easier to
   use than past Zens.

   For starters, it feels very comfortable in your hand. At 8.3 x 5 x 1.8,
   it lacks the cigarette-lighter slimness of the iPod Mini, but feels
   more solid, less flimsy. The screen's a small 1.4in white-backlit LCD -
   Creative's traditional blue backlight being reserved for the buttons
   beneath the display and the rim around the fascia. The display itself
   presents an almost but not quite an exact copy of the iPod UI. Another
   similarity is the ZM's ability to sync up with PIM software - Microsoft
   Outlook in this case - to hold your contacts and diary entries, ready
   for on-the-move access, PDA-fashion.

   The buttons - play/pause, track skip forward and backward, plus Menu,
   Back a step and a Zen Touch-esque central virtual jog-dial - are carved
   out of a single touch-sensitive panel that responds with a click and is
   far more responsive than the Touch's version. The ZM uses a simple
   select and click approach to menu navigation, with the aforementioned
   Back button taking you up the hierarchy one step at a time. It's a more
   intuitive system than those Creative players have offered and
   undoubtedly iPod-inspired.

   The Menu button doesn't take you straight to the top of the sequence of
   commands. Instead, it pops up a context-sensitive menu of options
   relevant to what's on the screen at that time. It's a nice idea spoiled
   by Creative's attempt to make the pop-up panel look like a desktop OS'
   right-click menu. Taking up a large portion of the bottom right of the
   screen, it looks kludgy - since it only appears for a moment, why not
   just fill the whole screen? But it does provide quick access to
   features like the ZM's list search system, its bookmark facility and
   on-the-fly playlist creation.

   On top of the ZM you'll find the power key, a spring-loaded slider
   that's moved one way to turn the player on and off and the other to
   lock the controls. Alongside it is the earphone socket - without an
   obvious remote control connector - the USB 2.0 port and the tiny hole
   that's the ZM's microphone. Yes, it provides the obligatory
   (apparently) voice recording facility, activated through the Extras
   menu. If you're into using your MP3 player as a Dictaphone too, the ZM
   is as good as any, providing up to ten hours' continuous recording,
   though there's a convenient context-sensitive menu option, Split, to
   break the recording into manageable chunks while you're taping.

   Siemens has issued a warning about potential ear damage caused by its
   65 series phones. If the battery is exhausted during a phone call, the
   handset shuts down, but before clapping out altogether, it plays a
   tune. Rather loudly. That's more polite than screaming "I'm spent!" in
   German into your ear, but the problem is serious. The handset plays the
   shutdown melody so loudly that the user's eardrum may be damaged, says
   Siemens.

   The flaw affects version 11 of the software of the C65, CX65, M65, S65
   model phones, and then only if the phone has already issued three
   low-battery warnings. Siemens has promised that users will get a free
   upgrade when it's available, and in the meantime recommends turning off
   "the disconnection melody".®

   A Californian pornographer is suing Google for copyright infringement
   alleging the search engine's image search is giving people free peeks
   at its mucky pictures. The company also complains that Google links to
   sites offering fake passwords.

   In the lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles the company - Perfect 10
   - asks for unspecified damages from the search engine for giving
   illegal access to its copyrighted material. Perfect 10 publishes a
   magazine and offers access to its website for a $25 monthly fee. It
   complains that anyone using Google's image search can see Perfect 10
   pictures without paying for them.

   Norm Zada, president of Perfect 10, told Reuters: "They're showing the
   pictures from my magazine and my website for free so there's no reason
   for anyone to buy my products. To add insult to injury, they give away
   my user names and passwords.".

   Nada told the newswire that he had sent about 30 formal requests for
   Google to remove copyright material before taking legal action. A US
   court ruled in 2002 that websites may display thumbnail size images
   without breaking the law.

   In January Nada launched legal action against Mastercard, Visa and
   other credit card companies complaining that they were facilitating
   trade in pirated images. At the time he told Reuters he'd lost $29m
   since setting the site up in 1996, including $8m spent on legal fees. ®

   America saw 403, 300 hi-tech jobs disappear between April 2001 and
   April 2004. More than half the jobs lost were lost after the recession
   was pronounced officially over, by the National Bureau of Economic
   Research, in November 2001. San Francisco and San Jose were the
   worst-hit places, according to the survey from the University of
   Illinois-Chicago.

   The fall represents 18.8 per cent of America's technology jobs -
   researchers estimate there are 1,743,500 hi-tech jobs in total. The
   survey looked at jobs in six areas and was paid for by the Washington
   Alliance of Technology Workers - a Seattle group which wants to
   unionise Microsoft workers.

   Marcus Courtney, president of WashTech, said: "It is stunning to think
   that in every region of the country, we have fewer high-tech jobs today
   than we did three years ago. We must focus on exporting our products
   instead of our jobs to turn this critical situation around."

   The research found that job losses in the IT sector were made worse by
   offshoring. Despite the gloomy picture there is some evidence that
   things have improved since the research ended in April - IBM said in
   August it was looking for an extra 19,000 staff, one third of them in
   the US.

90nm Opterons, Athlons to use strained silicon

   AMD has revealed that the 90nm processors it plans to ship in volume in
   the coming months will use strained silicon, reiterating claims the
   chipmaker made in April this year that it was planning to implement the
   technique.

   The strained silicon process involves applying a separate material,
   such as Silicon Germanium, to silicon wafers. The SiGe's atoms are more
   widely spaced than those in the regular silicon crystal lattice, which
   'strains' to align itself with the wider-spaced SiGe lattice. The
   upshot is more room for electrons to move between the lattice-locked
   nuclei, improving the semiconductor's electrical properties.

   Intel already uses strained silicon for its 90nm processors, as does
   IBM. The two companies both use SiGe, but IBM also uses
   silicon-on-insulator technology, which it claims makes strained silicon
   easier to implement because it can apply the SiGe to the wafer, strain
   the silicon then remove the SiGe before fabrication. Removing the SiGe
   means IBM doesn't have to incorporate the material into the structure
   of its processors, as Intel has had to.

   IBM calls its technique Strained Silicon Directly on Insulator (SSDOI).
   AMD is also an SOI supporter, but it has said it doesn't use the same
   approach as IBM. AMD staffers have said in the past that its straining
   is localised to specific components within the processor. That suggests
   that, unlike IBM's process, AMD's does not involve the removal of the
   SiGe. That may insulate it from the yield problems IBM has experienced
   with its 90nm PowerPC 970FX - aka 'G5' - processor, which are believed
   to centre on the materials used to make them.

   The question remains: has AMD's longer 90nm implementation timescale
   given it the time to explore and solve the problems experienced by
   rivals who came to market with 90nm chips earlier than it did?
   Unfortunately, that question will only be answered when AMD's chips are
   available in the market. ®

   Given that Blighty is the home of ThrustSSC, the 406 mph Peugot and the
   Mach 0.3 milk float , it comes as no surprise that one intrepid pioneer
   has bolted a jet engine onto the back of his mother-in-law's wheelchair
   and fired himself down a runway at 60 mph.

   Giuseppe Cannella wowed Bank Holiday crowds at a model plane
   championship in Lincolnshire with his supercharged vehicle. He told the
   BBC: "It is just the wheelchair with the engine bolted on the back and
   steering on the front. Originally it was a gimmick. I had a jet engine
   and I was going to put it on a go cart.

   "But the missus says put it on something unusual and so I put it on the
   mother-in-law's wheelchair. She was on holiday at the time so she
   didn't know what I was doing until she came back."

   Mercifully, Mr Guiseppe's mother-in-law had already bought a new set of
   wheels before her old jalopy got a touch of the Right Stuff. Cannella
   says he will use the vehicle to raise cash for the Parkinson's Disease
   Society. ®

   Toshiba today paved the way for 80GB iPods when it said it will ship an
   80GB 1.8in hard drive in Q3 2005 - a year after it introduced the 60GB
   version that can currently to be found inside the iPod Photo. Toshiba
   80GB 1.8in HDD

   The Japanese manufacturer didn't mention any customers by name of
   course, but having supplied Apple with micro hard drives to date, it
   seems likely the relationship will continue with the new, higher
   capacity.

   The 80GB HDD - model number MK8007GAH - comes in a 7.9 x 5.4 x 0.8cm
   casing. Toshiba will ship a 40GB version - model number MK4007GAL -
   that's just 0.5cm thick in the second quarter. It's lighter, too: 51g
   to the 80GB HDD's 62g. Toshiba's current 40GB and 60GB (model numbers
   MK4004GAH and MK6006GAH, respectively) 1.8in HDDs are 0.8cm thick, so
   the new drive should make for thinner mid-range iPods.

   Both drives spin at 4200rpm, offer an average seek time of 15ms and
   operate across an Ultra DMA 100 interface. They can take 500G operating
   shock and 1500G non-operating shock.

   Toshiba claimed the drives mark the first ever use of a perpendicular
   recording system in which the tiny magnetic domains used to store each
   bit of information are aligned at right-angles to the plane of the
   disk, not parallel to it, as is traditionally the case with HDD
   platters. The upshot, said Toshiba, is a far greater data density -
   206Mb per square millimetre - than anyone has been able to achieve so
   far in a drive of this class. ®

   Ten members of staff at a UK hospital have been suspended amid
   allegations that they used the net for shopping and holidays instead of
   working.

   University Hospital of North Staffordshire suspended the staff after it
   detected lots of online activity when staff should have been working,
   reports the BBC.

   Although staff are allowed to use the web at work for personal use, the
   hospital does have limits. An investigation, which is expected to last
   three weeks, is set to discover if staff misused their access to the
   net.

   This month a survey by employment outfit Peninsula found that workers
   are using the internet for personal use more than ever before. Ebay is
   the most popular site for workers on the skive with four in ten
   admitting that they trawl the auction site while killing time at work.

   In July, Peninsula also published research which found that British

   POLAR BEAR IN ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
   Subhankar Banerjee
   A polar bear makes its way across a frozen stretch of the Arctic
   National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. A report released Monday warns
   warmer Arctic temperatures could wipe out polar bears by 2100.

   OSLO, Norway — Global warming is heating the Arctic almost twice as
   fast as the rest of the planet in a thaw that threatens the livelihoods
   of millions of people and could wipe out polar bears by 2100, according
   to an eight-nation report released on Monday.

   The report, the work of more than 250 scientists and the biggest survey
   to date of the Arctic climate, found that the accelerating melt could
   point to wider disruptions from a build-up of human emissions of
   heat-trapping gases in the earth’s atmosphere.

   The “Arctic climate is now warming rapidly and much larger changes are
   projected,” according to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA),
   which was commissioned by the Arctic Council and funded by the United
   States, Canada, Russia, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Finland.

   The report projects that temperatures in the Arctic will rise by 8 to
   14 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 100 years. If temperatures then
   stayed stable, the Greenland icecap would melt altogether in 1,000
   years and raise global sea levels by about 23 feet.

   COVER PAGE FROM ARCTIC REPORT
   Arctic Council
   The cover page from the scientific overview on Arctic climate change
   prepared for the Arctic Council.
   Possible benefits like more productive fisheries, easier access to oil
   and gas deposits or trans-Arctic shipping routes would be outweighed by
   threats to indigenous peoples and the habitats of animals and plants.

   Sea ice around the North Pole, for instance, could almost disappear in
   summer by the end of the century, it said. The extent of the ice has
   already shrunk by 15-20 percent in the past 30 years.

   “Polar bears are unlikely to survive as a species if there is an almost
   complete loss of summer sea-ice cover,” the report said. On land,
   creatures like lemmings, caribou, reindeer or snowy owls are being
   forced north into a narrower range.

   Fossil fuels blamed
   The report mainly blames the melt on gases from fossil fuels burned in
   cars, factories and power plants. The Arctic warms faster than the
   global average because dark ground and water, once exposed, traps more
   heat than reflective snow and ice.

   “Changes in the Arctic provide an early indication of the environmental
   and societal significance of global warming,” it said.

   The thaw will have a global impact — melting of glaciers will raise
   global sea levels by about 4 inches by the end of the century.

   Many of the four million people in the Arctic are already affected.
   Buildings from Russia to Canada have been demolished because of
   subsidence linked to thawing permafrost that also destabilizes oil
   pipelines, roads and airports.

   Indigenous hunters are falling through thinning ice and say that prey
   from seals to whales is harder to find. Rising levels of ultra-violet
   radiation may cause cancers.

   Changes under way in the Arctic “present serious challenges to human
   health and food security, and possibly even (to) the survival of some
   cultures,” the report says.

   Even so, farming could benefit in some areas, while more productive
   forests are moving north onto former tundra.

   U.S. 'sidetrack' strategy?
   Foreign ministers from Arctic nations are due to meet in Iceland on
   Nov. 24 but diplomats say they are deeply split, with Washington least
   willing to make drastic action.

   Some European partners have accused the Bush administration of trying
   to weaken any policy recommendations that stem from the report.

   President Bush has made clear he opposes mandatory curbs on gases like
   carbon dioxide, which create a greenhouse effect on Earth. Many
   scientists fear fossil fuel sources of CO2 and other gases are warming
   the Earth beyond the natural greenhouse effect.

   Bush also pulled out of the U.N.’s 1997 protocol on global warming,
   arguing it was too expensive and exempted China, India and other
   rapidly developing nations.

   Most other industrial nations, most recently Russia, have agreed to
   Kyoto’s target of cutting developed nations’ CO2 emissions by five
   percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12.

   Interactive: The greenhouse effect One European negotiator said the
   administration is trying to "sidetrack the whole process so it is not
   confronted with the question, 'Do you believe in climate change, or
   don't you?'"

   A European diplomat added that “U.S. negotiators say 'we already have a
   policy on global warming — we can’t have a new one just for the
   Arctic'."

   The negotiator added that while the other member nations will try to
   press the United States on the matter in the final talks, "I cannot see
   any solution to this unless (the Bush administration) clearly changes
   its position."

   Scientists agreed to discuss parts of the Arctic Council report ahead
   of full publication. And some European governments originally wanted
   the report issued before Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election.

   U.S. objection to wording
   The Washington Post reported on Oct. 4 that the Bush administration has
   lobbied to drop a policy section stating that in order to meet climate
   goals set in 1992, the "Arctic Council urges the member states to
   individually and when appropriate, jointly, adopt climate change
   strategies across relevant sectors. These strategies should aim at the
   reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases."

   A senior State Department official who asked not to be identified told
   the Post that "we're bound by the administration's position. We're not
   going to make global climate policy at the Arctic Council."

   The White House said Monday it would not comment on the scientific
   review and would await a final report next year that includes input
   from diplomats. “This is one draft of a report that has yet to be
   finished,” White House spokesman Trent Duffy said.

   Environmental groups have urged the council to crack down.

   “The big melt has begun,” Jennifer Morgan, director of the World
   Wildlife Fund’s global climate change campaign, said in a statement.

   Yahoo Pumps Up the Volume with MusicMatch Acquisition

   Yahoo and Musicmatch, Inc. today announced they have signed a
   definitive agreement under which Yahoo will acquire Musicmatch for a
   purchase price of approximately $160 million in cash. The combination
   will substantially increase Yahoo’s music reach from 12.9 million to an
   estimated 23 million listeners . This extensive reach within an active
   and engaged music audience will make Yahoo! even more compelling for
   advertisers and record labels.

   “Yahoo is committed to being a major player in digital music,” said
   Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc. “This
   combination bolsters our strategy to capture the largest audience of
   consumers as they make the shift to digital music and supports Yahoo’s
   goal to give consumers the greatest choice, control and flexibility in
   how they interact with their music. This acquisition is one of several
   product innovations and new initiatives in which Yahoo will invest to
   build our music portfolio this year and in the future.”

   Digital music sales are expected to grow rapidly in the near future,
   particularly with the increasing availability of broadband access.
   Music subscription sales are expected to grow from $113 million this
   year to $890 million in 2009, while digital downloads are anticipated
   to reach $803 million in 2009, compared to $158 million for 2004

   Yahoo is brining on an entire hoopla of music features to their network
   in this latest aquisition. MusicMatch’s assetts include Musicmatch
   Jukebox software, which allows consumers to play, burn, download,
   discover, and organize an entire music collection; the online
   Musicmatch Radio network, which offers free and premium streaming
   access to more than 900,000 songs and more than 200 pre-programmed
   stations; and the Musicmatch Music Store a la carte song download
   service, which offers access to more than 700,000 tracks. Most
   recently, the company introduced the Musicmatch On Demand streaming
   music subscription service, providing unlimited access to more than
   700,000 songs from any computer as well as legal music sharing through
   its innovative “Send to a Friend” feature.

   Google is Growing â€“ An Update on Google

   There is a lot going on at the Googleplex these days. For three
   different reasons, each of which is important to search marketing,
   Google has been in the SEO spotlight this week. For the technology
   wonks, Google engineers are said to be developing a Google web browser
   to challenge Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. For those of us interested
   in the business end of search, the SEC imposed a 40-day “quiet period”
   which has expired and speculation on their limited revenue streams has
   heated up again. Lastly, for SEOs and web masters trying to figure out
   what Google is up to this month, multiple versions of Googlebot have
   been observed super-spidering the web. To say there is a lot going on
   in Mountain View is likely an understatement. Google is retooling its
   shed and though there may be some bumps in store for organic SEOs, this
   might actually be the beginning of the end of Google’s technical
   glitches.

   Google is being driven by two important forces. The first is the
   intellectual and competitive quest to develop the best possible
   product. Google faces obvious challenges from Yahoo, MSN and Ask
   Jeeves, and less obvious challenges from smaller companies developing
   search related products. The second driving force is the need to find
   as many viable revenue sources as possible. For a company like Google,
   the path to success is found on Advertising Avenue but most recently,
   the company came into a staggering amount of money through its IPO.

   Google Browser – Playing Ruthless with Redmond

   Google is most likely developing an web browser of its own to compete
   with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. This will allow Google to “brand” a
   user’s experience, much like Microsoft does today. (Look at the top of
   your browser. About 90% of you will see the words “Microsoft Internet
   Explorer”) Google has recently introduced its own Email system known
   Gmail and offers a host of other features that could be incorporated
   into a browser. The development of a Google web browser is much like
   Microsoft developing its own search engine. It is a direct challenge to
   a major rival and a smart move leading up to the next major phase of
   the search engine war, expected next spring. Here’s the background on
   the browser story.

   Google has a great deal invested in its engineering staff. Their
   resumÃ© filtering process for engineers is the stuff of legends and is
   designed to allow only the brightest to solve their way through a
   series of mathematical puzzles. Joining those who solved the puzzles
   are a number of notable new staff members personally headhunted and
   recruited from other tech firms. According to a report in Digital Media
   Europe, Google has hired Java pioneer Joshua Block away from Sun
   Microsystems, Adam Bosworth and four others from Microsoft’s Internet
   Explorer development team, and in a major coup, one of Microsoft’s lead
   developers on the Longhorn OS, Joe Beda. This sudden grouping of famous
   IT engineers, combined with Google’s April 2004 registration of the
   domain name “gbrowser.com” gives a great deal of credibility to the
   rumour. Google has also dedicated a substantial amount of time,
   attention and money to the Mozilla community.

   Mozilla is an open-source browser. Open-source software allows
   developers to work with the software-code to improve or change the
   product. By offering resources to Mozilla developers, Google may be
   micro-funding the creation of what becomes the backbone of a
   Google-branded browser. Google users would likely accept and use a
   Google browser, especially if it is based on the current tech
   favourite, Mozilla. Once they have converted from IE to Google’s
   product, directing their interest will be as easy as tracking their
   movements, two important components in making the bottom line.

   Money as a Necessary Evil – Expanding Revenue Sources

   Making money is an important part of running a successful business. One
   might think that becoming the world’s most referenced information
   source would be enough to make money. Apparently it’s not. Moving the
   most advertising on the web… now that’s a ticket to making good money.
   Google pushes product like nobody’s business. With over Â½ of all
   searches conducted through Google’s system in one way or another, and
   the largest contextual advertising distribution network on the planet,
   Google’s only major competition is Yahoo/Overture. Unlike
   Yahoo/Overture however, Google is in a somewhat precarious position
   regarding revenues. Over 90% of Google’s quarterly revenues is said to
   come from contextual advertising. That’s a lot of eggs to put in one
   basket, no matter how large that basket may be. The contextual
   advertising market is changing and this is a cause for concern for all
   search tools dependent on advertising revenues. Google is betting the
   server-farm on advertising so it has to develop as many ways as
   possible to deliver that advertising to viewers and do it in such a way
   that advertisers benefit more than they would working with Yahoo.
   Google has thus far been successful in competing with Yahoo’s Overture.
   They have developed a better distribution system, have more
   advertisers, and have better semantic contextualization abilities than
   Yahoo. What they don’t have is other major revenue sources.

   One of the goals of all search engines is to deliver the most relevant
   results possible to each individual user. Concepts such as
   personalization and localization of search results are based on this
   goal. One of the effects of localization and personalization will be
   the adoption of Google as a replacement for daily-use items such as the
   phone book and yellow pages. This is an obvious goal for Google and
   other search tools however it also represents an extraordinary and
   recurring revenue generator, especially as the Pay-per-Call model
   layers over the current Pay-per-Click model. As Google engineers find
   new ways of presenting search to the public, perhaps we’ll see new
   kitchen appliances referencing Google for recipes or even Froogle for
   the lowest prices on local produce. Eventually, digital radio and
   television will become the standard. Wouldn’t it be cool to look for a
   specific song or show currently playing somewhere? That may sound
   far-fetched today but, if they can do it with the news, they’ll soon do
   it with other digitalized signals. The bottom line to this section is
   the bottom line. Google knows it needs to diversify its revenue streams
   if only to continue to satisfy investors.

   Googlebot, meet GOOGLEBOT

   Lastly, Googlebot has a doppelganger and both have been running rampant
   across the Net the last few weeks. Posts in several SEO forums have
   speculated widely and wildly about what Google is doing and why it is
   doing whatever it is it’s doing. Nobody can claim to know what Google
   is doing from moment to moment with the exception of a few dozen people
   working at Google. The best the rest of us can do is offer educated
   guesses and many have been doing just that. There are definitely two
   unique Googlebots out there. One appears to be performing a deep-scan
   of a website and its links while another seems to be doing a surface
   scan of pages in the site’s directory. This leads credence to our first
   theory…

   Over at WebmasterWorld, moderator Brett Tabke speculated that Google
   was in the midst of rebuilding their entire database from the ground
   up. There have been a few times in the past when Google has served up
   month-old results due to errors in their main index. This may be one of
   those times and Google is trying to cover much ground in as short a
   time as possible. Given the unprecedented levels of R&D at the
   Googleplex, I am a bit bearish on much of this theory except a basic
   assumption that Google is somewhat broken and needs patching up.

   “Would you like some links with that website sir?”

   The Google is sort-of-broken theory appears in other postings, both at
   Webmaster World and at the IHelpYouServices forums. Google has been
   sort-of-broken for a while now. Actually, Google is working just fine
   but as search marketing has become so important, marketers have learned
   how to absolutely manipulate it. As almost everyone knows, Google is
   highly effected by the number and relevance of incoming links. Strong
   keyword enriched titles and text along with a good number of highly
   relevant links should get your site front page prominence. It’s
   relatively easy. So easy in fact that the search engine result pages
   are often clogged with irrelevant results and references to
   direct-marketing products. Google often makes minor moves to fix this
   problem, more often than not relating to the way Google measures the
   validity of incoming links. These algo shifts often clean up results
   for a short time but have not yet prevented the masses of marketers
   from figuring out new tricks and “magic bullet” strategies to shoot at
   the SERPs. This type of algorithm tinkering was what was behind last
   November’s Florida Update.

   Another theory states that when Google was originally programmed, the
   number 4Billion was considered really, really big. Today, Google has
   over 4Billion websites in it’s database but, due to its original
   programming it may be limited in growth past that requiring the
   compilation of a new database. As I am not a programmer and start to
   lose focus when words such as “point-integer” are thrown around, here
   is a link to a very lively discussion on this theory.

   Whatever the cause for two versions of Google bot, there is no question
   that an update is underway as this column is being written. Page ranks
   and backlink counts have been fluctuating over the past few days and
   several web masters report seeing their rankings bounce widely from
   page to page in the SERPs. By next week we’ll have a better idea of
   what Google’s been doing by analyzing the outcome of this update.

   The world of search is changing very rapidly. Google is one of the most
   innovative companies working the web and it too is changing. Based on
   the past week, much of this change may be for the better. Google seems
   to be focusing on technologies as well as monetization, which is a huge
   step forward now that the IPO hurdle has been crossed. When compared to
   rival firms such as Ask Jeeves, Yahoo and Microsoft, much of the recent
   speculation around Google looks very positive. Investors seem to think
   so too with Google shares continuing to rise in value though this may
   be driven by IPO euphoria as well as educated investing. With a new
   browser appearing to be in the works, the development of new revenue
   streams, and the refocusing of their core algorithm, Google is getting
   ready to be cool again.

   Link Exchange Scams

   Do you ever exchange links with other Web sites? I am sure most of you
   that do this, look to see if your links are actually on the pages that
   you exchanged with. In addition, I assume that you check to make sure
   that the links do not go through redirects.

   Links, as most the readers here know, are incredibly valuable. The
   anchor text of your links can make or break your page’s search ranking.
   There are dozens of reasons why a link exchange would be turned down.
   (1) Obvious, they do not link to your page. (2) The link goes through a
   redirect and does not pass PageRank or any value whatsoever. (3) There
   are way too many links on that page, do the value of all links are
   diluted. (4) They hide links with white text on white background
   (dangerous). The list goes on.

   A thread at SEO Chat discusses this and wether or not it is the
   responsibility of the link exchange scammee to notify the others. There
   is a list of links on a page, all of those links were exchanges. The
   members plan is to contact each link owner and notify them that the
   links from this scammer are not passing any value. Is this member being
   a Good Samaritan?

   Lycos Europe Aims To Thwart Spammers with DDoS Attacks

   "It's not going to work," said Laura Atkins, President of the SpamCon
   Foundation. "Spammers will start putting in garbage URLs, and most of
   those will belong to innocent bystanders. If it really works as Lycos
   says it does, spammers will use it as a harassment tool."

   Lycos Europe yesterday announced that it has created a downloadable
   screensaver aimed at putting spammers out of business with distributed
   denial of service, or DDoS, attacks.

   Available for both Mac and Windows, "Make Love, Not Spam" works by
   flooding a spammer's Web site with requests for data. The theory is
   that a very large number of requests sent at the same time will slow
   response time and result in increased bandwidth costs for spammers.

   Lycos says it uses a database that comprises only those Web sites using
   spam to promote their products. The company claims response times from
   targeted Web sites could decrease by as much as 85 percent. The company
   also says it aims for substantial slowdown -- not total shutdown --
   which could be illegal in many countries in which the screensaver is
   available. Lycos Europe also said the system employs an automated
   feature to ensure it never completely disables any site.

   Suspected spam URLs can also be reported on the "Make Love, Not Spam"
   Web site. Lycos Europe -- which is a separate company from the
   similarly named Web portal in the U.S. -- will offically launch the
   screensaver tomorrow.

Analysts Skeptical

   Despite widespread media attention, some analysts said the screensaver
   concept is unlikely to be a sustainable, long-term solution.

   "It looks a bit gimmicky to me," said Julian Smith, online marketing
   and advertising analyst for Jupiter Research, Europe. "Lycos is tapping
   into the consumer's irritation with spam and putting the consumer on
   the offensive, rather than the defensive. In reality, if Lycos can
   identify the source of the spam, it has a responsibility to ensure that
   those e-mails don't reach the customer in the first place.

   "And you have to ask, who's paying for sending out these messages? If
   customers are using dial-up or other metered services, will they incur
   additional charges?"

Could Hurt Legitimate Sites

   Another issue, Smith said, is that this could potentially be used
   against legitimate sites. "Even if Lycos is manually checking to verify
   each site, there's always the potential for error," she said.

   "It's not going to work," concurred Laura Atkins, President of the
   SpamCon Foundation. "Spammers will start putting in garbage URLs, and
   most of those will belong to innocent bystanders. If it really works as
   Lycos says it does, spammers will use it as a harassment tool."

Viable Solutions

   Lycos Europe says it plans to protect sites from this scenario by
   updating its records on a daily basis. But both Smith and Atkins said a
   long-term fix must be more wide-ranging.

   "The industry is working on solutions, such as true authentication,
   which will happen in the background," noted Smith.

   For example, one cooperative venture, known as the ESPC, or the Email
   Service Provider Coalition, is addressing spam and deliverability
   issues through legislative advocacy, technological development, and
   industry standards.

   "Legal enforcement will help, too," said Atkins. "Spammers are not
   scared of civil suits, but they are scared of going to jail. Most of
   them don't think the risk is worth it."

Consumer Participation

   Consumers also have to play a part, she said. "People must become more
   knowledgeable about computers and the Internet. Spammers can turn a
   compromised computer into a spam source, and the computer owner may
   never even know it."

   In the meantime, there are concerns that the screensaver solution could
   backfire. "Will it escalate the battle? Will they retaliate even
   harder?" asked Smith. Whatever happens, said Atkins, don't expect a
   quick fix.

   "Spam is not going to go away," she asserted. [end-enn.gif]

                   Fundamental Shift in Embedded Wi-Fi Market

      August 24, 2004

   Fundamental Shift in Embedded Wi-Fi Market

   A wireless LAN is one in which a mobile user can connect to a local
   area network (LAN) through a wireless (radio) connection. One of the
   hottest technology markets, Wireless LAN (WLAN), or Wi-Fi, is
   undergoing a fundamental shift, according to In-Stat/MDR. The high-tech
   market research firm reports that in 2003 removable Wi-Fi PC Card
   adapters were displaced as the most popular Wi-Fi adapter by embedded
   Mini PCI card adapters

   “The Wi-Fi Mini PCI card represented 49.1% of the Wi-Fi adapters
   shipped, and enabled most of the Wi-Fi mobile PCs (e.g. notebook and
   tablet PCs) in 2003,” says In-Stat/MDR analyst Norm Bogen. “Conversely,
   PC Cards held a quickly eroding 38.8% market share in 2003 after
   dominating the market with a 58.3% market share in 2002.” In-Stat/MDR
   expects that the Wi-Fi Mini PCI card will continue to capture an
   increasing percentage of the total Wi-Fi adapter market over the next
   five years.
   __________________________________________________________
   About Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi (or Wi-fi, WiFi, Wifi, wifi), for "Wireless
   Fidelity", is a set of standards for wireless local area networks
   (WLAN) based on the IEEE 802.11 specifications. Certified products can
   use the official Wi-Fi logo, which indicates that the product is
   interoperable with any other product also showing the logo.

   Wi-Fi was intended to be used for wireless devices and LANs, but is now
   often also used for Internet access. It enables a person with a
   wireless-enabled computer or personal digital assistant (PDA) to
   connect to the Internet by moving within, for example, 15 meters of an
   access point, called "hotspot".
   __________________________________________________________

   A recent report from In-Stat/MDR also reveals the following:

   - The market for embedded Wi-Fi clients (including mobile PCs, PDAs and
   phones) will grow at a 66.2% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to
   226.0 million units shipped in 2008.

   - After five years of healthy growth since its mainstream
   commercialization, the worldwide Wi-Fi hardware market (i.e. network
   infrastructure and adapters) finally surpassed $1.0 billion in (4Q
   2003) quarterly revenues.

   - There has been a significant growth in Wi-Fi-enabled notebook PCs, as
   55.0% of the 32.1 million notebook PCs shipped in 2003 contained
   embedded Wi-Fi adapters.

   The report, Wi-Fi Inside: The Embedded Wi-Fi Paradigm (#IN0401345WS),
   contains analysis and forecasts of the worldwide Wi-Fi market from
   2003-2008. The report also includes analysis of products and strategies
   of major vendors.

   More about Wi-Fi:

   Short for wireless fidelity and is meant to be used generically when
   referring of any type of 802.11 network, whether 802.11b, 802.11a,
   dual-band, etc. The term is promulgated by the Wi-Fi Alliance.
   Any products tested and approved as "Wi-Fi Certified" (a registered
   trademark) by the Wi-Fi Alliance are certified as interoperable with
   each other, even if they are from different manufacturers. A user with
   a "Wi-Fi Certified" product can use any brand of access point with any
   other brand of client hardware that also is certified. Typically,
   however, any Wi-Fi product using the same radio frequency (for example,
   2.4GHz for 802.11b or 11g, 5GHz for 802.11a) will work with any other,
   even if not "Wi-Fi Certified."

   Formerly, the term "Wi-Fi" was used only in place of the 2.4GHz 802.11b
   standard, in the same way that "Ethernet" is used in place of IEEE
   802.3. The Alliance expanded the generic use of the term in an attempt
   to stop confusion about wireless LAN interoperability.

Red Hat Revs Up China Operations

   Red Hat Revs Up China Operations

   One of the first initiatives for Red Hat Beijing will be to support
   Linux and open-source education by making the Red Hat Academy program
   freely available to students. Red Hat Academy is Red Hat's training
   program designed to enable teachers to train students to be Linux
   proficient.

   In a move to tap into the demand for low-cost software in developing
   markets, Red Hat announced yesterday it would open its first office in
   Beijing, China this week.

   The company said it is working with partners such as HP, IBM, Intel and
   Oracle to help the Chinese market learn more about open source and how
   to leverage its full benefits.

   Red Hat President and CEO Matthew Szulik said the company sees a great
   future for Red Hat in China.

   "Open-source software, and particularly Linux, has a critical role to
   play both in advancing the development of China's rapidly growing
   software industry and in creating the best information infrastructure
   for China's globally competitive enterprises," Szulik said.

An Inevitable Move

   Steve O'Grady of the research firm Red Monk told LinuxInsider that Red
   Hat's foray into Asia was all but inevitable. China, he said, is a
   critical market for any Linux vendor.

   "China is a market of opportunity and it has given indications that it
   is Linux-friendly," O'Grady said. "Red Hat needed to establish itself
   in China because China is one of the better and more sizeable Linux
   markets in the world."

   One of the first initiatives for Red Hat Beijing will be to support
   Linux and open-source education by making the Red Hat Academy program
   freely available to students.

   Red Hat Academy is Red Hat's training program designed to enable
   teachers to train students to be Linux proficient. Red Hat is working
   in partnership with Tsinghua University and Nanjing University to
   establish the program in China.

   With the training program Red Hat hopes to not only educate students on
   open-source fundamentals, but also inspire new open source development
   and entrepreneurialism.

Rallying Around Red Hat

   Red Hat has plenty of partner support in its China initiative. HP, IBM,
   Intel and Oracle are rolling out the red carpet for their Linux
   industry partner.

   Sam Lo, China HP's Director of Enterprise Storage and Servers, said HP
   is "committed to developing the Linux market in China."

   David Sung, vice president of IBM Software Group, GCG, said, "We will
   be able to take advantage of leading technologies of both companies for
   better on demand solutions for our Chinese customers."

   Ian Yang, Intel China general manager, said, "working with companies
   like Red Hat is part of the company's commitment to deliver
   high-performing Intel-based solutions to the Chinese market and to
   ensure Intel-based platforms are the platform of choice."

   And Leigh Warren, vice president of the Linux Business Unit for Oracle
   Asia Pacific, said demand for Oracle solutions on Linux has steadily
   increased over the last several months.

   "Oracle has enjoyed a long relationship with Red Hat to jointly service
   customers and we look forward to working together to service the
   Chinese market," Warren said.

Linux Competition

   For all the hoopla about Red Hat's entry into one of the world's
   largest consumer markets, the company still has plenty of competition
   from Asian Linux distributors, according to O'Grady. But he said the
   risks outweigh the rewards.

   "Red Hat needs much less of a percentage in China to achieve the same
   numbers that they get in the States because China is a massive market,"
   he said.

   "So on a percentage basis Red Hat can ratchet its goals down a little
   bit and still be quite successful. I don't see this as a tremendous
   risk for Red Hat."

   O'Grady said U.S. Linux competitors have every reason to be concerned
   about Red Hat's entry into China. Sun signed an agreement with a
   consortium sponsored by the Chinese government last year to get its
   software on about 200,000 desktops and could stand to lose market share
   in China with Red Hat's presence.

   "It will be interesting to see what a stronger Red Hat presence in
   China means to some its Linux competitors," O'Grady said. "Obviously
   they would prefer for Red Hat not to achieve the market dominance in
   China that it has in the States." [end-enn.gif]

GAO: Homeland Security's Enterprise Architecture Lacks Key Elements

   In a report, it says the agency's first try at building an enterprise
   architecture offers a partial foundation, but is lacking in several
   areas.

   The Department of Homeland Security's initial attempt at deploying an
   enterprise architecture furnishes the agency with a partial foundation
   to build future versions, but it's missing key elements found in
   well-defined architectures, the Government Accountability Office said
   in a report issued Tuesday.

   Homeland Security's enterprise architecture fails to adequately
   describe business processes, information flows among these processes,
   and security rules associated with the information flows, the GAO said
   in the report prepared for the House Reform Committee's Subcommittee on
   Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations, and the
   Census.

   The department is integrating 22 federal agencies, each specializing in
   one or more interrelated aspects of homeland security. Last September,
   the department issued an initial version of its architecture. Since
   2002, the Office of Management and Budget has issued various components
   of the federal enterprise architecture, which is intended to be a
   skeleton for informing the content of agencies' enterprise
   architectures. The panel asked the GAO, the investigative arm of
   Congress, whether the initial version of Homeland Security's
   architecture is aligned with the federal architecture.

   The GAO says Homeland Security's architecture is based on assumptions
   about a department or national corporate business strategy and,
   according to the department, is largely the products of combining the
   existing architectures of several of the department's predecessor
   agencies, along with their respective portfolios of system-investment
   projects.

   Homeland Security officials told the GAO that they agree with the
   auditor's conclusion that their initial version lacks key elements.
   Department officials say they faced a daunting task, noting that
   because Homeland Security is a new entity, it lacked a strategic plan
   and had limited resources and time--it only had four months to meet an
   Office of Management and Budget deadline last year to submit its fiscal
   year 2004 IT budget request.

   Department officials assure the GAO that the next version of the
   architecture, due next month, will have much more content. As a result,
   the GAO says, the department has yet to proffer the necessary
   architectural blueprint to effectively guide and constrain its ongoing
   business-transformation efforts and the hundreds of millions of dollars
   that it's investing in supporting IT assets. "Without this," writes
   Randolph Hite, the GAO's director of IT architecture and systems
   issues, "DHS runs the risk that its efforts and investments will not be
   well integrated, will be duplicative, will be unnecessarily costly to
   maintain and interface, and will not optimize overall mission
   performance."

   According to the GAO, the department's initial enterprise architecture
   can be traced semantically with the federal enterprise architecture,
   meaning that similar terms and definitions can be found in the
   respective architectures. But, the report says, traceability in terms
   of architecture structures and functions isn't apparent. Because of
   this, it's unclear whether the substance and intent of the respective
   architectures are aligned. GAO blames OMB for not clearly defining its
   expectations between agencies' enterprise architectures and the federal
   enterprise architecture, including what it means by architectural
   alignment.

   The GAO recommends that Homeland Security aim to improve the
   department's architecture content and development approach, and that
   OMB clarify the expected relationship between agencies and the federal
   enterprise architectures.

'Skulls' Trojan Taking Out Cell Phones with Symbian OS

   'Skulls' Trojan Taking Out Cell Phones with Symbian OS

   The malware file is named "Extended theme.SIS" and claims to be a theme
   manager for the Nokia 7610 smart phone, written by "Tee-222." The
   trojan was located on some Symbian shareware download sites. Users
   would have to intentionally install Skull as an application in order to
   be affected, company officials said.
   By Jennifer LeClaire • E-Commerce Times • ECT News Network
   Nov 22, 2004 9:02 AM PT

   Symbian has reported that a virus dubbed "Skulls" has been introduced
   to its operating system for wireless phones. The malware is targeted at
   the Nokia 7610 smart phone, but might affect other phones using
   Symbian's Series 60 User Interface.

   Skulls is a malicious SIS file trojan that will replace the system
   applications with non-functional versions in order to disable
   everything except the phone functionality, according to antivirus
   software maker F-Secure.

   The file is named "Extended theme.SIS" and claims to be a theme manager
   for the Nokia 7610 smart phone, written by "Tee-222." The malware was
   located on some Symbian shareware download sites.

Poisoning Applications

   "Skulls SIS file does not contain any malicious code as such, it is
   just a Symbian installation file that installs critical System ROM
   binaries into C: drive in with exact same names and locations as in the
   ROM drive," according to the F-Secure report.

   "The malicious part is in the AIF (application info and icon) file
   which comes with the applications," the report said.

   If Skulls is installed, it will replace all application icons with a
   picture of skull-and-crossbones, disallowing the launch of phone system
   applications like Web browsing, camera and text messaging. Users can
   still make and receive calls.

   F-Secure warns users who get the virus not to reboot the phone. The
   security firm advises users to follow the disinfection steps on its Web
   site in order to delete the two faulty files.

Symbian Speaks

   "It is Symbian's understanding that the suspected malware is no longer
   being distributed," company officials said in a statement. "It is
   unclear if the adverse effects of this software are the result of
   deliberate development (a trojan) or an inadvertent side-effect of poor
   software programming."

   Users would have to deliberately install Skull as an application in
   order to be affected, according to company officials. The malware
   cannot be installed without repeated user intervention, including
   ignoring a security warning. And the malware does not appear to have
   the ability to distribute itself to other phones.

   The company said it takes security issues very seriously and works
   closely with the security community to develop and integrate the most
   advanced security features for Symbian OS.

Threat To Watch

   While mobile phone viruses are not all that commoon today, IDC wireless
   analyst David Linsalata told the E-Commerce Times that these kinds of
   attacks are something to keep a close eye on.

   "People are starting to think about how they could write viruses for
   mobile devices," Linsalata said. "There is certainly the potential for
   abuse as these devices become more popular."

   Unlike the personal computing world, the mobile device industry has yet
   to see an attack that has been particularly threatening or widespread.
   However, Linsalata said if someone can figure out a way to release a
   very successful virus, then the possibility of wider damage is real.

   Viruses could possibly be written that would allow hackers to use
   someone else's phone to send text messages or retrieve private
   information in transit over a wireless network, according to analysts.

   The good news, Linsalata said, is that mobile operating system
   manufacturers and antivirus software makers are aware of the potential
   problems and are taking steps to add more security to mobile devices.

   "Companies are keeping a close eye on mobile device security," he said.
   "Viruses are not a serious concern right now, but there is an awareness
   of the potential problems." [end-enn.gif]

Yahoo Expands Search Wars to Mobile Service

   Yahoo Expands Search Wars to Mobile Service

   Yahoo COO Dan Rosenweig called the mobile effort a "crucial step" in
   the development of relevant search products and said it is intended to
   take advantage of the growing base of its existing Web users who also
   use browser-enabled phones and other mobile devices.
   By Keith Regan
   Oct 28, 2004 9:48 AM PT

   Yahoo has launched a mobile version of its Web, image and local search
   offerings, a move that opens up a new and wireless battlefield in the
   search engine wars.

   At least initially, Yahoo's mobile search will be stripped of
   content-relevant ads from its Overture paid listings business, a sign
   that analysts saw as a desire by the portal to build a customer base
   among mobile users.

   Google recently launched a mobile search service, but it is using a
   different approach that utilizes short message service (SMS) text
   blurbs to send and receive search results.

   Yahoo COO Dan Rosenweig called the mobile effort a "crucial step" in
   the overall development of relevant search products and said it is
   aimed at taking advantage of a growing base of its existing Web users
   who also use browser-enabled phones and other mobile devices.

   Users will be able to do unique searches as well as call up saved
   searches made from desktops and search Yahoo's collection of 1 billion
   images. However, analysts said the most useful and relevant features
   are likely to be the local search feature, which many users employ like
   an online yellow pages to find nearby businesses, and a series of
   shortcuts. Users will be able to place calls directly from search
   results pages, for instance.

   In addition, certain keywords entered into a mobile search will
   automatically lead to specific results, such as up-to-date sports
   scores, stock quotes or weather or airline flight information.

Different Paths, Same Destination

   Analysts say both Yahoo and Google have similar goals: To get their
   foot in the door with mobile users now that devices are finally getting
   sophisticated and widely used.

   For both, the mobile user will be an extension of the traditional Web
   search market. It's no surprise that their approaches are different,
   because Yahoo already offers mobile phone users access to photos and
   other services that it offers online, while the market is an entirely
   new one to Google.

   Google's SMS approach likely will appeal to younger users who are
   comfortable with text messaging, while Yahoo's Web approach might make
   other users more comfortable since it will be a stripped-down version
   of what already occurs online, Gartner analyst Phil Redman said.

   There's a natural tension, he noted, between the desire to make Web
   searches as comprehensive as possible and getting them minimized enough
   to be usable on mobile devices.

   "The nature of having to type and read from a phone or other device is
   a major hurdle to just moving what happens online to the mobile arena,"
   Redman said. While younger users are more comfortable with it, the
   company that finds the best way to move that information will have a
   leg up in the mobile market.

   Linking the searches from the desktop to the mobile device is where the
   potential seems to lie, he added. "Loyal users are the most valuable
   kind to advertisers and therefore to Google and Yahoo," he said. "In
   some ways it's early, but now's the time to start building a
   following."

   In fact, recent data from Forrester Research said that less than 10
   percent of U.S. mobile devices in use are advanced enough to handle Web
   browsing and color images.

Many Fronts, One War

   Meanwhile, newcomers are starting to offer new approaches to search,
   and established companies such as Amazon and Microsoft are vowing to
   stake their own claims.

   "Every one of these moves underscores how broad and deep the search
   market can go," said Forrester Research analyst Charlene Li. "The
   companies know the appetite for marketing to users through search is
   strong enough that they're going to leave no stone unturned."
