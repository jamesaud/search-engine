     * Whittingham's choice: What's on the table

   BYU or Utah may have a replacement coach lined up this morning. The one
   who rolls out plans for an official announcement first will be set. The
   other will have work to do.

   The man front and center is Utah defensive coordinator Kyle
   Whittingham. Sources say the University of Utah has pushed hard in the
   past 48 hours for Whittingham to replace Florida-bound Urban Meyer.
   Utah officials offered Whittingham the head Ute coaching job and will
   demand a decision by today.

   BYU, whose university president Cecil Samuelson and associate athletic
   directors Tom Holmoe, Peter Pilling and Brian Santiago completed a
   series of interviews Friday and Saturday, reacted to Utah's timetable
   Monday by rushing Whittingham to meet with an apostle of The Church of
   Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a mandatory step in the hiring
   process of the church-owned school.

   This tug of war, which has included discussions of money and length of
   a contract by both parties, should reach a conclusion today, according
   to informed sources close to both negotiating parties.

   While BYU officials made the first run at Whittingham the day after
   Meyer accepted the Florida job last Thursday, Utah put on its show
   Sunday. Utah wheeled in high-ranking school officials and boosters.
   Approximately 30 Ute players swarmed in Whittingham's living room
   Sunday in an emotional plea for him to take the job.

   Utah chose Meyer over Whittingham two years ago when Ron McBride
   stepped down.

   If Whittingham elects to stay at Utah, expect a press conference today.
   Utah athletic director Chris Hill, however, declined comment through
   sports information director Liz Abel.

   If Whittingham declines the Ute job for his alma mater to the south,
   where he played on the 1980 squad that defeated SMU in the Holiday
   Bowl, BYU may not have an official announcement until Wednesday or
   Thursday. Members of BYU's athletic administration return Wednesday
   from New York City, where LaVell Edwards will be inducted into the
   College Football Hall of Fame tonight.

   Whittingham and offensive coordinator Mike Sanford were considered top
   Utah candidates immediately after Meyer decided to go to Florida,
   according to sources. Sanford decided Saturday to accept the head job
   at UNLV. Sanford will reportedly receive a five-year contract that pays
   $600,000 per year.

   Monday afternoon, Sanford called the situation "a gold mine" at a press
   conference in Las Vegas.

   "I have extremely high expectations," he said.

   So, too, do his new bosses.

   "Mike Sanford met all criteria that we set for a new coach from day
   one," UNLV athletic director Mike Hamrick said in announcing the
   hiring. "We believe our fans are in for some exciting, wide-open
   football. I know that he can't wait to get started on continuing to
   build this program into a consistent winner."

   Sanford takes over for John Robinson, who retired after six seasons at
   UNLV. He played for Robinson at Southern California.

   "His qualifications are impeccable and he coaches the best offense in
   America right now at Utah," Robinson said. "Mike has coached at many
   great universities and also in the NFL, so his experiences are
   fabulous. He is enthusiastic with an outgoing personality. Everyone is
   going to love him. I am happy for our players."

   Sanford also drew praise from Meyer, who will be formally introduced as
   Florida's new coach today in Gainesville, Fla.

   "Mike Sanford has an excellent offensive mind. He has been a big part
   of our success this year," he said. "He is not only a great coach, but
   a great person. Mike will do an outstanding job at UNLV."

   Meyer has repeatedly predicted that Whittingham would be a successful
   head coach as well.

   Utah's job is believed to be a deal worth $500,000 per year.

   BYU's base package, the one utilized by former coach Gary Crowton, is
   estimated around $300,000 but could approach $400,000 to $450,000 a
   year with incentives, bonuses and a Nike shoe pact and radio/ TV
   contracts added.
   BYU's other top candidates include USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow,
   whose public interest in the Cougar job has been less than positive,
   and current coaches Lance Reynolds, Bronco Mendenhall and Paul Tidwell.
   If BYU were to elevate any of its current assistants, the hiring
   process would not be as complicated as the one with Whittingham the
   past 72 hours.

Australia in control against NZ

   Justin Langer and the Adelaide heat burnt New Zealand on a lop-sided
   opening day of the second trans-Tasman cricket Test today.

   Langer scored his 20th Test century in a chanceless two-paced knock to
   spearhead Australia to 3-327 at stumps at the Adelaide Oval.

   The West Australian will tomorrow resume on 144 (277 balls) and
   home-town hero Darren Lehmann 28 as Australia aims to amass a 500-plus
   total.

   Langer shared in two century stands with Matthew Hayden (70) and
   skipper Ricky Ponting (68) as the world champions dominated from the
   first ball of the day as temperatures hit 37 degrees.

   Any pain the Black Caps felt about losing the toss and being forced to
   bowl first on a batsman's paradise was exacerbated by Langer's early
   aggression.

   He started the day by belting a boundary and a three off Chris Martin
   and then hit four boundaries off the next over from James Franklin to
   have 23 from his first eight balls.

   Seen as adding a new dimension to the NZ attack due to his ability to
   swing the ball, left-armer Franklin went for 18 off his first over and
   was taken off after only three with 0-26.

   The 24-year-old, who had boasted 20 wickets at the fine average of 19.4
   from five Tests, was also belted for four consecutive boundaries by
   Langer with the second new ball.

   On passing 123 with the first of his four successive fours off
   Franklin, Langer notched 1000 calendar year runs for the first time in
   his 12-year Test career.

   Langer was reined in, and sometimes troubled, midway through his
   six-hour knock by the tight bowling of Jacob Oram (0-25 from 15 overs)
   and Daniel Vettori (1-74 from 28).

   He brought up his third Test ton in Adelaide from 212 balls with a leg
   glance off Vettori.

   NZ's second new face to the side which lost the first Test in Brisbane,
   off-spinner Paul Wiseman, finished with the best figures of 2-56 from
   14 overs.

   Wiseman sparked the main drama of the day when he accepted a well-timed
   return catch from Hayden in his second over.

   Despite lifting the half-volley up in the air, the Australian opener
   stood his ground and the umpires conservatively referred the decision
   to the third umpire who eventually gave the red light.

   Wiseman, chosen largely to bowl on a deteriorating pitch late in the
   game, also dismissed Damien Martyn (7), caught at slip by Stephen
   Fleming.

   Ponting looked set for his first century this year when he motored to
   68 off 78 balls before being stumped off a well-flighted Vettori
   delivery.

Mourinho's Blues cruising again

   Chelsea returned to form and extended their lead at the top of the
   English Premiership with an impressive 4-0 win at Charlton Athletic
   today.

   Jose Mourinho's side were stung by a late Bolton equaliser a week ago
   and were held to a goalless draw by Paris Saint-Germain in the
   Champions League midweek but refound their goalscoring touch to go five
   points clear of champions Arsenal, who play at Liverpool tomorrow.

   Manchester United continued their creep up the Premiership table with
   their fifth consecutive win as they swept West Bromwich Albion aside
   3-0, while Blackburn got off the bottom rung with a 2-0 win at Fulham.

   Republic of Ireland winger Damien Duff took just four minutes to set
   Chelsea on their way at The Valley with a left-footed shot from six
   yards out.

   Ricardo Carvalho headed onto his own post to give Charlton hope but
   Chelsea moved into top gear in the second half and put the match beyond
   doubt.

   John Terry made it 2-0 with a downward header direct from an Arjen
   Robben corner two minutes after the break for his first Premiership
   goal since March.

   The England centre-half took another three minutes to score his second,
   knocking the ball over the line after Ricardo Carvalho headed back
   across the face of goal from another corner.

   Eidur Gudjohnsen beat the offside trap to latch on to a Frank Lampard
   pass before slotting in the fourth on 59 minutes.

   Former Manchester United skipper Bryan Robson has taken over at West
   Bromwich but that did not stop the visitors sending his side to the
   bottom of the table at The Hawthorns.

   United boss Alex Ferguson had demanded his side win all their games
   until the New Year to retain any hope of winning the title.

   Paul Scoles was 20 yards out when he scored in the 53rd minute,
   smashing the ball past Russell Hoult in the Albion goal.

   The former England midfielder had not scored in 22 games before finding
   the net in last weekend's 2-0 win over Charlton.

   Ruud van Nistelrooy made it 2-0 in the 72nd minute with a header before
   Scholes nodded in his second with eight minutes left to re-establish
   United's championship credentials.

   Blackburn Rovers finally got their first away win of the season,
   beating Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage.

   Paul Gallagher's 10th-minute strike and a Paul Dickov penalty 13
   minutes from time sealed the precious win for Rovers, who had not won
   in the eight Premiership games under Mark Hughes since his first match
   in charge.

   Fulham defender Zat Knight received a second yellow card and was sent
   off when he handled in the box, giving the visitors their late spot
   kick.

   Portsmouth got off to a good start in caretaker-manager Velimir Zajec's
   first game in charge after Harry Redknapp's resignation.

   Pompey had previously lost three consecutive games before Arjan de
   Zeeuw's header gave them a 1-0 win at Bolton Wanderers' Reebok stadium.

   Gary O'Neil curled a free kick into the box and the Dutchman rose to
   flick a header low and hard into the bottom corner of Jussi
   Jaaskelainen's goal just before half-time.

   Birmingham City drew 1-1 at home to Norwich City in the first
   top-flight match between the sides in 20 years.

   City had not scored in over six hours at St Andrews but striker Clinton
   Morrison scored his first Premiership goal since April in the ninth
   minute, reacting quickest after an Emile Heskey header rebounded off
   the bar.

   Darren Huckerby equalised in the 64th minute to keep the Canaries off
   the foot of the table.

   Premiership strugglers Southampton and Crystal Palace drew 2-2 at St
   Marys.

   Palace's in-form striker Andy Johnson scored his ninth Premiership goal
   of the season three minutes into the second half when he headed in from
   eight yards before Kevin Phillips equalised two minutes later.

   Wayne Routledge took a further four minutes to restore the visitors'
   lead with a shot which deflected in off Andreas Jakobsson.

   The Sweden defender made amends 14 minutes from time when he equalised
   to ease some of the pressure on Saints boss Steve Wigley.

   German kayak queen Fischer claims gold No. 8
   SCHINIAS (AP) — Birgit Fischer is still winning gold medals at age 42.
   Germany's kayaking legend got her eighth gold on Friday, becoming the
   first woman to win Olympic medals 24 years apart.

   Germany to another gold. [clear.gif]
   By Armando Franca, AP

   Germany's kayaking legend got her eighth gold on Friday, becoming the
   first woman to win Olympic medals 24 years apart.

   "You never know if it's going to be the last medal you win, so in that
   sense, it has a higher meaning," Fischer said.

   Her four-person kayak trailed by three-tenths of a second halfway
   through the 500-meter flatwater final, but Fischer set a torrid pace up
   front and the Germans won by two-tenths of a second over Hungary, with
   Ukraine taking bronze.

   Fischer looked left after crossing the line and knew immediately her
   squad had won. She raised her paddle above her head with both hands,
   then pumped her right fist several times. Her much younger teammates
   leaned back, closed their eyes and gasped with exhaustion.

   Fischer won her first gold at 18 in Moscow, becoming the youngest women
   ever to win an Olympic kayaking event. She now has 11 total medals and
   will be a strong contender for yet another on Saturday, when she races
   in the pairs kayak final.

   When asked if she thought the medal was her last, she became coy.

   "I have no idea," she said. "Who knows?"

   This much is certain: Fischer still has what it takes to win them. At
   the 2003 world championships, before Fischer made her comeback, the
   Germans were 5th with a K-4 entry paced by Maike Nollen, who moved back
   to the second seat this year.

   "Birgit gives me a lot of confidence to concentrate on my job. I'm
   calmer," Nollen said. "The last time, when I had to ride in the front,
   I was under higher pressure, and now I just have to follow her."

   The Hungarians won last year's world championship and seemed stunned
   that Fischer could make such a difference.

   "We did the best we could, but the Germans were too fast," Hungary's
   Katalin Kovacs said. "I am not pleased."

   Spain's Cal upsets Dittmer for C1 1000-meter gold

   Olympic gold was more of a novelty for the men who raced on the first
   day of canoe and kayak finals.

   Spain's David Cal surged ahead of the most dominant man in his sport to
   take gold — his first Olympic medal — in the 1,000-meter single canoe
   event.

   Germany's Andreas Dittmer, the defending gold medalist and three-time
   defending world champion, led just out of the start, but Cal passed the
   32-year-old and pulled out to nearly a one-second lead at the halfway
   mark.

   Dittmer, who won silver, said he let Cal get too big of an early lead
   and realized going into the last 250 meters that the 21-year-old
   Spaniard was not about to fade.

   "And I realized I'm not as good as I supposed I'd be," Dittmer said.

   Cal, subdued in triumph, said his front-running pace took everything
   out of him.

   "Now I only want to rest," he said.

   The race was expected to be a showdown between Dittmer and 1996 gold
   medalist Martin Doktor of the Czech Republic. But Doktor, who lost his
   heat race and was forced to race in the semifinal round, finished one
   spot out of the medals. Attila Vajda of Hungary ended up in third.

   In the single kayak 1,000-meter race, two-time world champion Eirik
   Veraas Larsen of Norway pushed ahead of his rivals to take gold as his
   first Olympic medal.

   Ben Fouhy of New Zealand won the silver after charging from fifth
   place. Adam van Koeverden of Canada, who led the race at the halfway
   point, held on for bronze.

   The Swedish kayak pair of Markus Oscarsson and Henrik Nilsson won their
   1,000-meter event, improving on their silver in Sydney. Italians
   Anontio Rossi and Beniamino Bonomi, the defending Olympic champions,
   finished second, less than .05 seconds ahead of the Norwegian squad,
   whose third-place finish gave Larsen his second medal of the day.

   The Germans took their second gold when the canoe pair of Christian
   Gille and Tomasz Wylenzek won their 1,000-meter final. They were 1.3
   seconds behind Russia at 500 meters, but a strong second half gave them
   gold with more than a second to spare. Russia held off Hungary for
   second. Gille raced with a black arm band in honor of his late former
   racing partner Thomas Zereska, who died of leukemia this year.

   "I just wanted to show the world how much this whole thing hurt," Gille
   said. "The first few weeks after Thomas died were very, very hard for
   me."

   In the men's K-4 1,000, the Hungarians, backed by a flag-waving
   following that took up nearly a whole section of grandstands, crossed
   the line first to the loudest cheers of the day. They led the Germans
   by about four-tenths of a second at 500 meters and pulled away from
   there. The Germans remained second, with Slovakia taking bronze.

   Seahawks hand Niners first shutout since '77
   SEATTLE (AP) — Rashad Moore, Ken Lucas and Ken Hamlin weren't even born
   the last time the San Francisco 49ers failed to score. Cedric Woodard
   and Chike Okeafor were in diapers. Those playmakers and other stars
   from the Seattle defense — it's a long list — ended San Francisco's NFL
   record streak of scoring in 420 regular season as the Seahawks won 34-0
   on Sunday. (Related item: Box score)

   times in Seattle's 34-0 win. [clear.gif]
   By Elaine Thompson, AP

   "At halftime, we came in and talked about it," Woodard said. "We had a
   chance to stop them, and they hadn't been shut out since the '70s. It
   sure was nice to be in that position. It was even better to go out and
   do it."

   It was the first time San Francisco failed to score since a 7-0 loss to
   Atlanta at Candlestick Park on Oct. 9, 1977, breaking its league record
   spanning 420 regular season and 36 playoff games.

   "I probably had some friends here, but they all probably left in the
   third quarter," said 49ers coach Dennis Erickson, who grew up in
   Everett, Wash. "I'm embarrassed about the whole game."

   Matt Hasselbeck threw for 254 yards with two touchdowns, Shaun
   Alexander scored three TDs and Seattle's defense was magnificent.

   Seattle (3-0), which has allowed only 13 points in its first three
   games, simply shut down the 49ers (0-3). Second-year quarterback Ken
   Dorsey was 19-of-32 for 153 yards with two interceptions and San
   Francisco had only 48 yards rushing.

   "We try to make plays every time," Hamlin said. "Everyone is getting to
   the ball and good things happen when you go to the ball."

   When the 49ers finally threatened midway through the fourth quarter,
   Hamlin made an interception in the end zone after Dorsey threw into
   double coverage.

   "This is a tough league and you have difficult times," Dorsey said. "I
   need to learn from it and move on."

   Later in the fourth, San Francisco drove to the Seattle 32. Okeafor
   sacked Dorsey to force another fumble and Moore scrambled to cover the
   loose ball, sealing the shutout.

   "It doesn't matter who gets the game ball," Moore said. "It was a day
   where you feel you're left out if you're not the guy making plays. All
   the D-tackles had big plays, so I had to go and make one, too."

   The Seattle offense looked better after sputtering last week at Tampa
   Bay. Hasselbeck, who was 21-of-30, threw a 3-yard TD pass to Alexander
   in the first quarter and added a 1-yard TD pass in the third to Itula
   Mili.

   Alexander didn't have a huge day rushing, gaining 52 yards on 19
   carries. But as usual, he was hard to keep out of the end zone, scoring
   on two 1-yard runs along with his TD pass from Hasselbeck.

   "You definitely feel better, putting that many points up," guard Chris
   Gray said. "Really, to put up that many points against any team in the
   NFL is quite an achievement."

   After wins on two long trips to New Orleans and Tampa Bay, the Seahawks
   kept rolling at home. They went 8-0 last season in Seattle and have won
   10 straight at home going back to 2002.

   Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, an assistant on San Francisco's standout
   teams of the 1980s, noted that Seattle defensive coordinator Ray
   Rhodes, line coach Dwaine Board and linebackers coach John Marshall
   worked together on San Francisco's last Super Bowl championship squad
   in 1994.

   "The 49ers are a proud organization," Holmgren said. "Getting a shutout
   is hard to do."

   The defense set the tone, with a first-quarter interception by Lucas
   setting up a field goal. Then came a hat trick by Woodard — a sack, a
   forced fumble and recovery on one play — leading to 10 easy points.

   "I've never even had a sack before," Woodard said. "If you're going to
   have one, that's the way to get it started."

   Four plays later, the Seahawks led 17-0 after Hasselbeck hit Alexander
   for the 3-yard TD pass. Seattle had a big early lead, despite holding
   the ball for only 5:34 of the first 15 minutes.

   The closest the 49ers came to scoring was a 46-yard field goal attempt
   by former Seahawks kicker Todd Peterson in the second quarter. It was
   short, and the ball bounced harmlessly off the crossbar.

   Notes: Former Seahawks QB Dave Krieg was inducted into the team's Ring
   of Honor during a halftime ceremony. ... San Francisco WR Brandon Lloyd
   (groin) and DT Andre Carter (back) were inactive. ... Seattle FB Mack
   Strong didn't return after spraining his right knee in the first
   quarter. ... Seahawks backup LB Tracy White sustained a concussion on
   first-quarter kickoff coverage. ... The crowd of 66,709 was a record
   for a home game at three-year-old Qwest Field.

   Drivers ready for Talladega's high-speed chess game
   NASCAR team reports as the Nextel Cup's championship chase enters its
   third race at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway:
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-09-29-inside-notes.jpg] [clear.gif] Major traffic jams such as
   this one will likely be the order of the day at Talladega. [clear.gif]
   By Bill Elliott, AP

   Jeff Gordon

   No. 24 Chevrolet, Hendrick Motorsports: Earlier this year Gordon
   achieved something he had never done in his 12-year career — he won two
   restrictor-plate races in one season. Sunday at Talladega
   Superspeedway, he has a chance to accomplish something only the late
   Dale Earnhardt was able to do: win three restrictor-plate races in a
   season. Earnhardt won both races at Talladega and one of the two at
   Daytona International Speedway in 1990. Gordon has won at Talladega and
   Daytona. However, he is not preoccupied with tying a mark or making
   history. He is in the midst of his team's "Drive for Five," the team
   slogan as it chases its fifth Cup championship. After finishing third
   at Dover (Del.) International Speedway, he leads by one point over Kurt
   Busch. ... In 23 starts at Talladega, Gordon has three wins, 10
   top-five finishes and 13 top-10s. He has led 489 laps, more than any
   driver entered in this weekend's event, and has led the most laps on
   three occasions.

   Kurt Busch

   No. 97 Ford, Roush Racing: With his second consecutive top-five finish
   last week at Dover, Busch remains second in the standings, one point
   behind new leader Jeff Gordon. Busch is the only Chase for the Nextel
   Cup contender to have top-five finishes in the first two playoff-style
   races. ... Busch has been in the top 10 for 27 consecutive race weeks
   (his only week out during 2004 was after a 16th-place finish in the
   season-opening Daytona 500). He was No. 1 after a sixth-place finish in
   April at Texas Motor Speedway and shared the lead with Dale Earnhardt
   Jr. for one week after his win two weeks ago at New Hampshire
   International Speedway. ... Busch has been strong at Talladega with
   four top-10s in seven career starts. ... He'll drive the same car that
   finished 16th at Daytona but that he wrecked at Talladega in the
   spring, finishing 22nd. ... "Talladega is definitely going to be the
   wild card in the Chase for the Nextel Cup," Busch said. ... His pit
   crew won the McDonald's Drive-Thru Pit Championship in Sunday's MBNA
   America 400.

   Dale Earnhardt Jr.

   No. 8 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Inc.: Earnhardt is coming off two
   consecutive second-place finishes at Talladega. He was runner-up to
   teammate Michael Waltrip in this race last year and to Jeff Gordon in
   the yellow-flag finish that led to thousands of bottles and cans being
   hurled onto the track by angry fans in April. Earnhardt is a four-time
   winner at the 2.66-mile track. ... He has finished first or second in
   his last six races at Talladega. In nine starts at Talladega, Earnhardt
   has four wins (a record-setting streak from Oct. 21, 2001, to April 6,
   2003) and seven top-10s. Only once has Earnhardt gone an entire race at
   Talladega without leading a lap: his first April 16, 2000. He has since
   led in eight consecutive races for a total of 411 laps. ... On the
   heels of a ninth-place finish at Dover — his fourth top-10 in his last
   five races — he enters third in the championship standings.

   Jimmie Johnson

   No. 48 Chevrolet, Hendrick Motorsports: Johnson's 10th-place finish
   Sunday at Dover moved him to fourth in the title race. ... Johnson has
   posted five consecutive top-10 starts at Talladega, including two poles
   in 2002. He has a 4.0 starting average in five races at Talladega, the
   best among active drivers. ... Crew chief Chad Knaus holds five
   restrictor-plate pole awards — Stacy Compton at Talladega in April 2001
   and October 2001, Johnson at Daytona in February 2002 and Johnson at
   Talladega in April 2002 and October 2002 (in the latter, Johnson
   started first after qualifying was canceled because of rain). ...
   Johnson will bring a new car, one he tested two weeks ago at Talladega.
   ... He overcame a cut left-rear tire early in the April race after he
   and Jamie McMurray made contact. Johnson narrowly avoided a few other
   accidents to finish fourth, a few car-lengths out of the lead.

   Mark Martin

   No. 6 Ford, Roush Racing: Martin's second-place run at Dover continued
   his upward movement in the Chase. He's tied with Jimmie Johnson but
   behind in the tiebreaker because Johnson has more victories this
   season. ... Martin has won at seven of the 10 tracks that will decide
   the Cup winner and has multiple wins at four of the eight tracks
   remaining, including two wins at Talladega. He has 12 wins, 70
   top-fives, 115 top-10s and 10 poles in 211 starts at the remaining
   eight tracks. Martin has finished in the top 10 in 55% of his starts at
   those tracks. ... Martin has posted 11 top-fives and 21 top-10s at
   Talladega. Martin has own two poles at the track, both coming in 1989.
   He was inducted into the Talladega Walk of Fame in 2002 for his
   accomplishments there. ... Martin's two victories at Talladega tie him
   with several other drivers as the second most by an active driver.

   Elliott Sadler

   No. 38 Ford, Robert Yates Racing: Although Sadler and his team have
   prepared for Talladega just like any other race, they know anything can
   happen and they are at the mercy of 42 other teams that surround them.
   Sadler is sixth in points after finishing 20th at Dover. Although he
   has just one top-10 finish at Talladega, Sadler's performance over the
   last two seasons has been impressive with one third-place finish and a
   pole in this race a year ago. ... "When we went to New York City a few
   weeks ago, we were sitting in about four lanes of bumper-to-bumper
   traffic. The only difference between that traffic jam and racing at
   Talladega is 190 mph," Sadler said. "It is really hard to ask 43 human
   beings to be perfect for 3½ hours. I know there are a lot of teams in
   this Chase feeling a lot of pressure, but for some reason our team
   isn't feeling anymore pressure than we normally would." ... Crew chief
   Todd Parrott has prepared chassis No. 79, the backup car at all the
   restrictor-plate races this year.

   Matt Kenseth

   No. 17 Ford, Roush Racing: Kenseth finished 32nd at Dover after
   wrecking heading to pit road. He has 16 top-10s in 28 starts in 2004.
   Kenseth has been in the top 10 for 63 consecutive weeks, the longest
   active streak. ... The team will bring chassis No. 40 to Talladega.
   It's brand-new and has been tested once. ... This marks the final race
   for the 2004 Smirnoff Ice colors for the team. ... Kenseth started 31st
   and finished 42nd here in April and started 37th and finished 33rd in
   this race last year. His best finish at Talladega is fourth in the fall
   race in 2001. ... "We just need to go out this week and try to run up
   front," Kenseth said. "We need to stay out of trouble all day long, and
   a lot of times that's a factor that's out of your hands, but we have to
   do our best. I think we have a good car that we're bringing, and we'll
   see what we can come up with on Sunday and hopefully get some of our
   points back."

   Ryan Newman

   No. 12 Dodge, Penske Racing South: Newman climbed to eighth in the
   standings after his victory at Dover last week. Newman will make his
   sixth Nextel Cup start Sunday at Talladega. He has earned one top-five
   and two top-10 finishes at the 2.66-mile superspeedway. ... Newman
   scored a career-high finish of fourth at Talladega in this race one
   year ago. He finished 11th there in April. He has an average finish of
   20.8 at the track. ... Newman has posted three top-10 starts at
   Talladega. He carries an average start of 10.40. ... Crew chief Matt
   Borland will take a chassis to Talladega that has never been raced but
   was tested during preseason events at Daytona International Speedway.
   ... Newman's average starting position of 8.25 this season leads all
   drivers. He also leads with 19 top-10 starts. ... In the final 10 races
   of 2003, Newman scored eight top-10 finishes, including a fourth at
   Talladega.

   Tony Stewart

   No. 20 Chevrolet, Joe Gibbs Racing: Stewart, the 2002 Cup champion,
   started 37th and finished 22nd in April at Talladega. ... In this race
   last year he started 11th and finished third behind Michael Waltrip and
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. ... This will be Stewart's 205th Cup start and his
   12th series start at Talladega. He has finished second at Talladega
   three times (fall of 2002, spring of 2001 and fall of 2001). Second
   place is Stewart's best finish in a point-paying restrictor-plate race,
   a feat he has accomplished four times. Three of those second-place
   finishes have come at Talladega, and the most recent second-place
   finish came in this year's Daytona 500. ... In three of the four
   second-place finishes, Stewart has been runner-up to Earnhardt Jr. The
   race where Earnhardt wasn't the victor was the fall 2001 Talladega 500.
   Bobby Hamilton was the winner while Earnhardt finished eighth. ... Five
   of Stewart's 19 Cup wins have come in October and November (26.3%). And
   of the 19 wins, six have come at the remaining eight tracks on the
   schedule.

   Jeremy Mayfield

   No. 19 Dodge, Ray Evernham Motorsports: Mayfield's car is chassis No.
   43, which finished 21st at Talladega in April and 22nd at Daytona in
   July. ... This weekend's race marks Mayfield's 21st visit to Talladega.
   He has three poles, one top-five and one top-10 finish and has led
   seven races for 43 laps at the track. He earned his best finish (fifth)
   at the track in the fall of 1998. ... Mayfield earned his seventh
   career pole position, and his first for Evernham Motorsports, in last
   year's Aaron's 499 at Talladega. The pole was Mayfield's third at
   Talladega and made him one of three active drivers to score three or
   more poles at the track (Sterling Marlin, three, and Bill Elliott,
   eight). ... Mayfield won the pole position at Talladega in July 1996,
   making him the only active driver to have earned his first career pole
   at the track. ... "Something I learned a long time ago about Talladega,
   you're either real good off the truck or you're not," Mayfield said.

   Others:

   Jamie McMurray (No. 42 Dodge, Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates):
   McMurray heads to Talladega sitting 11th in points. He has posted seven
   top-five and 17 top-10 finishes during the 2004 season. In four starts
   at Talladega, McMurray has a best finish of ninth place, in April. ...
   Kevin Harvick (No. 29 Chevrolet, Richard Childress Racing): Talladega
   has been extremely good to the Bakersfield, Calif., native in the last
   year and a half. Harvick's been more successful here than anywhere
   else, posting three top-10s in his last three outings. A victory Sunday
   could make a race out of the 11th position in the standings. McMurray
   holds a 101-point advantage over Harvick, who took over 12th with his
   21st top-20 finish of the season Sunday at Dover. ... Bobby Labonte
   (No. 18 Chevrolet, Joe Gibbs Racing): Labonte will start his 23rd race
   at Talladega. He has one win and one pole at Talladega, both coming in
   the spring race of 1998. ... Kasey Kahne (No. 9 Dodge, Ray Evernham
   Motorsports): Kahne moved up to 14th place after Dover and is 14 points
   out of 12th place and 113 out of 11th. He will drive chassis No. 61,
   which finished 30th at Talladega in April and 25th at Daytona in July.
   ... Dale Jarrett (No. 88 Ford, Robert Yates Racing): This weekend's EA
   Sports 500 is the 36th race of Jarrett's career at Talladega. Jarrett
   has one win, nine top-fives and 13 top-10s here. ... Rusty Wallace (No.
   2 Dodge, Penske Racing South): Wallace only hopes he can go 25.129 mph
   slower this time around than the last time he drove at Talladega. In
   Wallace's last visit June 9, he turned in an unofficial lap speed of
   216.309 mph (44.270 seconds) during a special unrestricted test
   session. That high-speed opportunity came at the request of NASCAR
   officials, who wanted to see how fast he could go without a restrictor
   plate. ... Sterling Marlin (No. 40 Dodge, Chip Ganassi Racing with
   Felix Sabates): Marlin will bring chassis No. 005 to Talladega. This
   will be the third time this chassis will race this year. Marlin's bid
   for a top-10 finish earlier this year at Talladega went flat on lap 146
   when the left-rear tire went flat and the team discovered a hole in the
   radiator. He finished 30th. ... Greg Biffle (No. 16 Ford, Roush
   Racing): Biffle hopes to score restrictor-plate win No. 2 with chassis
   No. RK-158. It's the same car that won the pole for this year's Daytona
   500. Biffle's previous restrictor-plate win came in the 2003 Pepsi 400
   at Daytona. ... Casey Mears (No. 41 Dodge, Chip Ganassi Racing with
   Felix Sabates: Mears earned his first top-10 finish at Talladega in the
   Aaron's 499 in April.

   Evening Attire is wearing well
   By Tom Pedulla, USA TODAY
   While horses continue to fall off an extremely bumpy road to the
   Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships, Evening Attire keeps on
   trucking.
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-09-30-attire-inside.jpg] [clear.gif] Evening Attire, winless in
   10 starts after capturing last year's Gold Cup, won the Aug. 22
   Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap. [clear.gif]
   By Adam Coglianese, NYRA via AP

   "I've never been around a horse like him who has been able to keep it
   going," trainer Pat Kelly says of his 6-year-old gelding. "Part of it
   is him. He does what he wants to and he takes care of himself."

   There is much to be said for durability in a season in which equine
   stars have been as fleeting as shooting stars.

   Smarty Jones was retired not long after he missed the Triple Crown by a
   length against Birdstone in the Belmont Stakes.

   Veterinarians expected a full recovery from foot injuries in time for a
   full 4-year-old campaign, but owners Pat and Roy Chapman found the
   instant riches that accompanied the decision to retire him to stud too
   tempting.

   This week two more high-caliber older horses, Peace Rules and former
   Belmont Stakes winner Sarava, were retired because of injuries. Both
   were expected to run in Saturday's $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at
   New York's Belmont Park (ESPN, 4-6 p.m. ET). The field was further
   diminished when Brooklyn Handicap winner Seattle Fitz fell out of
   consideration after a sluggish workout Monday.

   That dismal background makes Evening Attire all the more appealing.
   After winning the Jockey Club Gold Cup last year, at least he is robust
   enough to return to defend his title.

   "It's sad to lose two nice horses like that," Kelly said. "We're just
   training our guy to do his thing."

   Other major races Saturday at Belmont Park: the $750,000 Joe Hirsch
   Turf Classic, to be run at 11/2 miles; the $750,000 Flower Bowl
   Invitational, at 11/4 miles; and the $500,000 Vosburgh, a 6-furlong
   sprint. West Coast action is highlighted by the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon
   Stakes, a 11/4-mile turf race at Santa Anita in Arcadia, Calif.

   Many trainers will use these races with an eye toward the Breeders'
   Cup. The championship day will be Oct. 30 at Lone Star Park in Grand
   Prairie, Texas. "We know it's there," Kelly said. "We'll kind of make a
   decision after we see what happens on Saturday."

   Evening Attire had gone winless in 10 consecutive starts after last
   year's Gold Cup. But he rebounded to take the Aug. 22 Saratoga
   Breeders' Cup Handicap.

   "When he's happy and doing good, he's right up there on the pace and
   you know he's in the race," Kelly said. "When he's not, he's way back."

   He said no decision has been made concerning whether to race Evening
   Attire at age 7. "At this point we take each day as it comes," Kelly
   said. "As good as he has been to us, I'm sure we'll take care of him at
   that point."

   Shortened meet:

   Meadowlands Racetrack is hoping a shortened meet with an enhanced purse
   structure will translate into quality racing.

   The East Rutherford, N.J., oval opened a 33-night stand Friday night
   with the expectation that it will award approximately $290,000 in
   purses per evening. It has allotted $3.1 million for graded and
   overnight stakes.

   Storm even up series with Sun in 67-65 victory
   By Tim Booth, The Associated Press
   SEATTLE — Betty Lennox and the Seattle Storm withstood a record-setting
   performance by Connecticut's Nykesha Sales and forced a decisive third
   game in the WNBA Finals. Sales scored a WNBA Finals record 32 points,
   but missed a 3-pointer as time expired, giving Seattle a 67-65 win in
   Game 2 of the league finals Sunday night. (Related item: Box score)

   Game 3 will be Tuesday night in Seattle.

   Sales and Lennox turned Game 2 into an individual showcase that came
   down to the final shot.

   Sales set finals records for most points, most field goals in a game
   (14) and most points in a half (21). She made seven consecutive shots
   before hitting the side of the backboard with no time remaining.

   But it was Lennox coming out on top, scoring a season-high 27 points
   for Seattle.

   "I was just trying to put more buckets on the scoreboard than she was,"
   Lennox said. "My mentality wasn't to force it, just take what the
   defense gave me."

   Lennox hit 11-of-16 shots and took advantage of her matchup with rookie
   Lindsay Whalen. Seattle's other starters combined to shoot just
   10-of-36.

   "Two players that really weren't highlighted coming into the series
   just took over," Seattle coach Anne Donovan said. "One great play after
   another at both ends.

   "It was fun to watch. I'm glad we're going to Game 3."

   With Connecticut down 13 in the second half, Sales made sure the Sun
   would not fade away. She scored 15 points in the final 7:14 of the game
   as Connecticut rallied to tie the game at 57 with 5:20 left.

   "The ball was just going in for me, so I just tried to create a little
   more," Sales said.

   The Sun, who never led in the game, quickly fell behind 63-57 after a
   6-0 run by Seattle. Lennox made two baskets and Vodichkova added
   another to give Seattle a six-point lead with less than four minutes
   left.

   Sales answered, scoring five points in the final 90 seconds to help
   pull the Sun within two at 67-65. Lennox missed with 14 seconds left,
   Seattle's Sheri Sam got the rebound and was tied up by Sales.

   Seattle's Lauren Jackson corralled the ensuing jump ball, but Katie
   Douglas came up with a steal and called timeout with 3.1 seconds left.

   On Connecticut's final chance, Sales had an open look on a 3-pointer
   from the corner, but hit the side of the backboard.

   Sales said she wasn't sure how much time was left and rushed the shot.

   "I thought our last shot was in, but Nykesha got herself a little too
   deep," Connecticut coach Mike Thibault said. "We got the shot that we
   wanted."

   Jackson added 15 points and 11 rebounds for Seattle, which shot
   24-for-62. Sue Bird had 10 points.

   Katie Douglas scored 14 for Connecticut, which won the series opener
   68-64.

   The game drew an announced sellout crowd of 17,072 to KeyArena, despite
   the Seattle Seahawks playing the St. Louis Rams at Qwest Field across
   town.

   The Storm led by five at halftime and tried to take control early in
   the second half.

   With just under 19 minutes left, Connecticut's Wendy Palmer strained
   her right shoulder trying to tie up Vodichkova.

   Palmer did not return, and without her presence in the paint, Jackson
   scored back-to-back baskets to key a 13-4 run, giving Seattle a 52-39
   lead.

   Palmer and Taj McWilliams-Franklin combined for just two points in Game
   2 after teaming up for 26 points and 14 rebounds in Game 1.

   "Palmer getting 16 points on us in Game 1 is a back breaker. You don't
   expect those players to step up and score like that," Donovan said. "We
   talked about that and tried to get a better focus on that."

   Seattle fed off the huge crowd and was on the verge of turning the game
   into a blowout early, scoring 11 of the first 13 points and taking a
   22-10 lead after just nine minutes.

   Seattle's offense then began to struggle, and the Storm hit just four
   of their next 20 shots and Connecticut pulled to 35-30 at halftime.

   Galaxy, Rapids to get reacquainted quickly
   By Ridge Mahoney, Special for USA TODAY
   Although they met four times in the regular season, the Los Angeles
   Galaxy and Colorado Rapids don't know each other that well heading into
   their first-round playoff, which starts Friday in Denver (9:30 p.m. ET,
   Fox Sports World, HDNet).
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-10-21-galaxy.jpg] [clear.gif] Steve Sampson is coaching the
   Galaxy now, but the goal is the same: the MLS title. [clear.gif]
   By Matt Sayles, AP

   They haven't played in three months, since the Galaxy completed their
   run of one win and three ties against Colorado with a scoreless game
   July 14 at Invesco Field. Four days earlier, Los Angeles had beaten
   Colorado at home 2-0.

   Since that last meeting, the Galaxy fired coach Sigi Schmid and
   replaced him with former U.S. national team coach Steve Sampson, whose
   record is 2-3-3. Schmid was booted with the Galaxy in first place; it
   finished second in the Western Conference, six points behind Kansas
   City and two points ahead of the Rapids.

   Colorado scored a league-worst 29 goals in 30 games, partially because
   of injuries to its attacking players. Goalkeeper Joe Cannon held the
   fort with 150 saves and a 1.07 goals-allowed average; he's the odds-on
   choice to be named goalkeeper of the year and is in the running for MVP
   as well.

   "When you think about number of games missed due to injuries by
   offensive players," coach Tim Hankinson says, "the guys you looked at
   before the season who were going to get goals for us, the ability to
   get points shows a great effort by the team. It's like a poker game
   each week. You don't know what you'll do until you see the hand you've
   been dealt. Then you either bet heavy because you like what you got or
   you've got to be good at bluffing."

   Top scorer Jean-Phillipe Peguero (seven goals, four assists) played
   just 18 games. Attacking dynamo John Spencer (seven, one) missed eight
   games. Veteran midfielders Chris Henderson and Mark Chung scored just
   three goals each. Because of injuries and call-ups to the U.S. team,
   defender-midfielder Pablo Mastroeni played only 17 MLS games.

   The Galaxy have scored only seven goals and conceded nine since Sampson
   took charge. He benched Austrian midfielder Andreas Herzog and changed
   the team's formation, which has sometimes stranded Guatemalan striker
   Carlos Ruiz without much support. Ruiz scored 11 goals this season but
   has netted just once during Sampson's tenure.

   "If you want wide players to get forward, you have to have two holding
   midfielders," says Sampson, who has used American Pete Vagenas and
   Brazilian Marcelo Saragosa to anchor the middle. "If you defend with a
   block of six, that allows you to attack with five. The combination of
   Saragosa and Vagenas has given us a bit more stability in the middle of
   the field."

   Herzog has played as a substitute in the last two games, a 2-0 win
   against Dallas and a 1-0 loss to Kansas City last weekend. He leads the
   team with seven assists. Jovan Kirovski scored twice against Dallas,
   and of his eight goals, four have been game-winners.

   "This is a good formation for me," Kirovski says. "I can come deep, and
   then either Carlos or I can hold the ball up. It gives us a chance to
   run from midfield."

   Only by reaching the MLS Cup championship game Nov. 14 can the Galaxy
   erase memories of last year's postseason collapse. Leading San Jose 4-0
   on total goals in the second game of their playoff series, Los Angeles
   completely disintegrated and lost 5-4. As was the case last year, MLS
   Cup 2004 will be played on the Galaxy's home field at Home Depot Center
   in Carson.

   Schmid had coached the Galaxy since May 1999. He compiled a record of
   80-53-32 in the regular season and was 16-7-3 in the playoffs. He led
   the Galaxy to the championship game in 1999, 2001 and 2002.

   "We all remember last year and what's expected of us this year," says
   Galaxy defender Tyrone Marshall, one of several holdovers from the 2002
   championship team. "You don't replace a winning coach unless your goal
   is the top."

   The Eastern semifinals kick off Saturday, with New York/New Jersey
   hosting D.C. United (7:30, Fox Sports World) and New England at home
   vs. Columbus (9:30, FSW, tape delay). Defending champion San Jose will
   host Kansas City on Sunday (5, ESPN2). The rematches will be held next
   weekend.

   [trans.gif] Lukas goes 'all-in'; Azeri goes to Classic
               [black.gif]

Poker-face trainer bets mare can outrun colts

   By Hank Wesch
   UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER

   October 27, 2004

                                                TOM FOX / Associated Press
      When Azeri gets onto the track at Lone Star Park, it will be for the
                                           top prize at the Breeders' Cup.

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas – Azeri, the queen of thoroughbred racing for the
   past three years, could exit the game royally flush or as a royal bust
   in the Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships here Saturday.

   And if that all-or-nothing prospect seems severe, it merely reflects
   the metaphor trainer D. Wayne Lukas used yesterday in announcing a
   decision to enter the 6-year-old mare today in the $4 million Classic
   rather than the $2 million Distaff.

   "This is Texas. The Breeders' Cup is kind of a 'Texas hold 'em' (poker
   game), and we're going all-in," Lukas said. "We're going to go in the
   Classic."

   Last week Azeri was pre-entered in the Distaff and Classic, giving
   Lukas and owner Michael Paulson options for today's close of entries
   and post-position draw for the eight-race, $14 million event at Lone
   Star Park.

   Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championship

   When: Saturday

   Where: Lone Star Park, Grand Prairie, Texas

   Races: Distaff, Juvenile Fillies, Mile, Sprint, Filly & Mare Turf,
   Juvenile, Turf and Classic.

   The decision to make the bold move of taking on the toughest male
   equines going in the Classic rather than run the 2002 Horse of the Year
   against her own gender in the Distaff was, Lukas said, not easy.

   "A lot of thought went into it. Michael Paulson and I really agonized
   over it," Lukas said. "We went over all the pros and cons. We looked at
   all the situations. It was our unanimous decision . . .

   "She's as good right now as human hands can make her, and we're going
   to swing for the fences; we're going to see what happens. She's already
   won the Distaff (in 2002). She's the leading (North American female)
   money winner of all time.

   "We'll step out of the box and see if we can do something that has
   never been done before. We're going to play our queen."

   In the only previous assignment against males of her 23-race career,
   the Metropolitan Mile Handicap in May at Belmont Park, Azeri was never
   closer to the lead than third and finished eighth in a field of nine,
   beaten by 6¾ lengths.

   But Paulson, who said last week that Saturday's race "most likely,
   probably" would be Azeri's last before retirement for breeding, wasn't
   discouraged by the Metropolitan loss.

   He cited the mile distance as being a bit short for Azeri, a dead track
   and being stuck along the rail for much of the journey as extenuating
   circumstances.

   Azeri's two phases

   2001-2003

   Trained by Laura de Seroux

   Starts: 16
   Wins: 14
   Second: 1
   Third: 1
   Earnings: $3,044,820

   2004

   Trained by D. Wayne Lukas

   Starts: 7
   Wins: 3
   Second: 2
   Third: 0
   Earnings: $915,000

   Azeri won 14 of 16 starts, including a streak of 11 straight stakes
   wins, took the Horse of the Year title – a rarity for a female – and
   two gender-division Eclipse Awards from 2001-'03 when based at San Luis
   Rey Downs in Bonsall and trained by Laura de Seroux.

   But when the winning streak ended in the Lady's Secret Handicap in
   September of last year at Santa Anita, a parting of the ways between
   Paulson and de Seroux soon ensued. Citing a tendon injury that showed
   up in X-rays, de Seroux recommended Azeri be retired.

   Paulson took his champion to Kentucky, had the injury examined at two
   renowned veterinary clinics there and, given the go-ahead, turned Azeri
   over to Lukas for a 2004 campaign.

   The result has been three wins in seven starts – the notable victories
   coming in the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn Park in April and the Go For
   Wand at Saratoga in August. The notable defeats, the only two instances
   in which Azeri has finished worse than second in her career, came in
   the Met Mile and the Ogden Phipps in June at Belmont Park in which she
   finished fourth, beaten by nearly 12 lengths by archrival Sightseek.

   "We've had a couple rough trips this year, but overall, she has had an
   exceptional year, winning three Grade I's on three separate tracks
   against different opponents." Paulson said. "She's done extremely well,
   and even in defeat she has put in some of her best races of her career.

   "I have no regrets whatsoever about bringing her back. At Saratoga, a
   standing ovation erupted from the crowd (showing) just how pleased the
   race fans were to see the champion. And the same thing at Keeneland
   (Spinster, Oct. 10).

   "It has been a very gratifying year."

   On Saturday, de Seroux will be watching from Keeneland in Lexington,
   Ky., where she will saddle a horse in the day's featured stakes.

   Contacted there Monday, de Seroux correctly predicted that Azeri would
   be entered in the Classic. But she said that whatever race, watching
   Azeri would trigger memories.

   "It was such a wonderful experience," de Seroux said of her years with
   Azeri. "She arrived as a plain brown package and she developed into an
   amazing, special being that became one of the greatest racing mares of
   all time. There's no explanation for it."

   Watching Azeri's performances from afar this year has been intriguing
   for de Seroux. She said she watched "partly out of curiosity to see if
   my instincts (of past years) would be confirmed and partly to see if
   some of my questions would be answered."

   The Humana Distaff on Kentucky Derby day at Churchill Downs was
   interesting. In '03, Paulson had acceded to de Seroux's wishes in
   passing on the race because it meant shortening to a seven-furlong
   sprint one month after a testing victory in the 1 1/16-mile Apple
   Blossom, Azeri's first race after a long winter layoff.

   This year, under similar circumstances, Azeri lost by a head in the
   Humana to Mayo on the Side, an unheralded filly carrying an 11-pound
   lighter impost.

   In both 2002 and '03, de Seroux had been pressed to run Azeri against
   males but failed to find what she considered an opportune spot.
   Following the Humana Distaff this year, Azeri's next assignment was
   against males in the Met Mile with the eighth-place result.

   "I've had some of my curiosities fulfilled and questions answered," de
   Seroux said. "But in fairness to (Paulson and Lukas), she had already
   accomplished winning Horse of the Year once and the (older female)
   Eclipse Award twice and had nothing to prove.

   "They wanted to test her limits and it has been interesting to me to
   see them do that. Within that parameter, she has been unbelievable."

   [trans.gif] Sharapova a big hit at WTA Championships
               [black.gif]

   By Beth Harris
   ASSOCIATED PRESS

   12:15 a.m. November 12, 2004

                                                     [041112sharapova.jpg]
                                                          Associated Press
    Maria Sharapova of Russia returns a shot to Svetlana Kuznetsova at the
       WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles. Sharapova won the match 6-1,
                                                                      6-4.

   LOS ANGELES – Men yelled encouragement and whistled at her. One tossed
   a long-stem red rose on the court. Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova
   was a big hit playing for the first time in the season-ending WTA
   Championships.

   "I love it here. The atmosphere is great," Sharapova said. "To be here
   where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love
   basketball."

   The Russian teenager had 23 winners Thursday night in a 6-1, 6-4
   victory over U.S. Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.

   Earlier at the Staples Center, Amelie Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva
   6-1, 6-0 to extend her winning streak to nine matches as the
   Frenchwoman tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the year-end No. 1
   ranking.

   In the late match, Serena Williams struggled for the second straight
   night, beating Elena Dementieva 7-6 (3), 7-5. Tied 5-all, Williams
   broke Dementieva with two solid forehand volleys and then served out
   the match when the Russian's forehand sailed long.

   Sharapova had never beaten Kuznetsova in three previous meetings,
   including a 6-2, 6-2 semifinal loss in Beijing in September.

   "In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak (14 matches)
   and she was unstoppable," Sharapova said. "This time, it was important
   to start off well and put some pressure on her."

   Sharapova hit 69 percent of her first serves, which averaged 103 mph.
   She improved to 7-6 against her fellow Russians this year.

   Tied 2-all in the second set, Sharapova went on to break Kuznetsova
   three times and closed out the hour-long match with a backhand winner.

   "I didn't serve well," Kuznetsova said. "She was returning pretty good,
   but I let her do this. She was putting pressure on me all the time."

   Williams appeared cranky throughout her match, grimacing as shots
   sprayed out of bounds. She had 37 unforced errors, giving her a
   two-match total of 98. She won just eight more total points than
   Dementieva.

   "I'm a perfectionist, I'm insatiable," Williams said.

   She has won just two titles this year, and none of them came in Grand
   Slam events. She didn't qualify for this tournament until last week,
   when sister Venus lost in Philadelphia, giving Serena a berth.

   "I'm hoping for a really good year next year. I'm not worried about
   this year," she said.

   Mauresmo remains on course for a potential tussle with Davenport.

   The Frenchwoman's winning streak includes titles the last two weeks in
   Philadelphia and Linz, Austria. She also reached the final last month
   in Filderstadt, Germany, but had to withdraw because of a groin strain.

   Mauresmo spent five weeks in the No. 1 spot after the U.S. Open before
   her injury gave Davenport a walkover victory in Germany. That allowed
   the American to overtake Mauresmo, and Davenport could stay there if
   she reaches the final Monday night.

   "Reaching the No. 1 ranking was a big step for me. I felt relief at
   that," Mauresmo said. "Since then, I feel very confident on court and
   my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but it's very
   different than before I was number one. It was an obsession, but now I
   take it in a relaxed way."

   Making her first appearance in the season-ending tournament, Zvonareva
   committed 25 errors and never had a break point against Mauresmo's
   serve. The Frenchwoman connected on 73 percent of her first serves.

   "She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis," said
   Mauresmo, the runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final.

   The players are assigned to Red and Black four-woman groups and play
   each other once. The two players with the best record from each group
   will advance to the semifinals. The singles winner will earn $1 million
   and a car to donate to charity.

   Zvonareva is 0-2 so far, having lost 6-2, 6-4 to Kuznetsova on
   Wednesday night. For the second straight match, an emotional Zvonareva
   bounced her racket off the court, smacked balls in anger and tears
   streaked her face after the loss.

   "Sometimes not everything works," she said. "It was lots of pressure.
   Maybe that is why I couldn't do one hundred percent. But I was
   fighting."

   Dementieva also is 0-2 in round-robin play.

   Davenport didn't play Thursday, but she received a new car as the
   leading qualifier for the eight-woman tournament.

   Serena Williams reacts after beating Amelie Mauresmo of France 4-6, 7-6
      (2), 6-4 in their semifinal match during the WTA Tour Championships.
      Williams moved a step closer to salvaging her season with a 4-6, 7-6
                (2), 6-4 semifinal victory over Amelie Mauresmo in the WTA
                                                  Championships on Sunday.

   LOS ANGELES – Serena Williams moved a step closer to salvaging her
   season with a 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4 semifinal victory over Amelie Mauresmo
   in the WTA Championships on Sunday.

   Williams, ranked eighth and without a Grand Slam title this season for
   the first time since 2001, advanced to Monday night's final against
   either Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova or French Open winner
   Anastasia Myskina.

   Mauresmo's loss guaranteed Lindsay Davenport will retain the top spot
   when the year-end WTA rankings are released Tuesday. The Frenchwoman
   had to win the tournament to topple Davenport, who failed to advance to
   the semifinals. Davenport also ended the year at No. 1 in 1998 and
   2001.

   Mauresmo's 11-match winning streak ended, which included titles in
   Austria and Philadelphia the last two weeks.

   Mauresmo failed to convert any of her 12 break points in the third set,
   when Williams smacked winners on 10 of them. Mauresmo had six break
   points in the fourth game, but Williams held at 2-all.

   Williams outlasted Mauresmo in a 13-deuce, 32-point game to hold for a
   5-3 lead. Mauresmo had five break chances and gambled by charging the
   net. But it cost her when she netted a forehand volley to lose the
   game.

   She held to trail 5-4 before Williams served out the match, hitting an
   overhead smash off Mauresmo's short return on match point. Williams
   improved to 8-1 in her career against Mauresmo, including a semifinal
   win at Wimbledon

   Williams has won two titles this year, but no success in the Grand Slam
   events. She skipped the Australian Open while rehabilitating her left
   knee, then had quarterfinal losses to Jennifer Capriati at both the
   French and U.S. Opens and lost the Wimbledon final to Sharapova.

   Chase comes to Florida with trio in hot pursuit
   Answers to pressing questions heading into Sunday's Ford 400 Nextel Cup
   race at Homestead-Miami Speedway by USA TODAY's Chris Jenkins:
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-11-18-inside-green.jpg] [clear.gif] Jeff Gordon, left, and Kurt
   Busch start 1-2 in last week's race at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway.
   [clear.gif]
   By Patrick Collard, AP

   Q: What will the atmosphere be like in the garage area this weekend?

   A: One race to go, and the tension is so thick, noted outdoorsman Ward
   Burton could barely slice it with a big, scary hunting knife. Kurt
   Busch holds a slim 18-point lead on Jimmie Johnson, and Jeff Gordon is
   only 21 points behind Busch.

   "If you've got a shot at that championship, then the pressure's on,"
   Gordon says. "You've got to go out there and run hard."

   Is it any coincidence that Gordon has mentioned the P-word anytime he's
   asked about the championship? Might he be trying to play subtle mind
   games with his younger championship rival? If so, he doesn't seem to be
   alone.

   "I think if I'm Kurt, I would be really nervous," Dale Earnhardt Jr.
   says. "Because he's in the situation where, you know, it's really
   basically up to him and his team to win or lose it. We just have to go
   out there and race as hard as we can and throw, you know, everything we
   got at it and see what happens." Gulp! No pressure, kid.

   Busch, for the record, hasn't seemed to be particularly tense in recent
   weeks despite the fact that his team lost a great deal of momentum when
   his engine broke at Atlanta Motor Speedway three weeks ago. Busch went
   to Key West for a day this week to relax.

   As much pressure as there is on the drivers, there will be just as much
   on the teams — and possibly more as the race goes on and pit stops
   become more important. Gordon couldn't hide his dismay at a mistake by
   his pit crew last Sunday, and Busch and his team struggled to adjust
   his car's handling Sunday.

   Q: What are the chances of a Robby Gordon-type situation happening this
   weekend?

   A: It's possible a non-Chase for the Nextel Cup driver could take out
   one or more of the top three title contenders; Robby Gordon got into a
   scrap with Greg Biffle at New Hampshire International Speedway in the
   first race of the Chase, and the ensuing wreck collected
   championship-eligible drivers Tony Stewart and Jeremy Mayfield.

   The five closest championship-winning margins in NASCAR Cup history:

   [bullet.gif] 1992: Alan Kulwicki wins the title, 10 points ahead of
   Bill Elliott
   [bullet.gif] 1979: Richard Petty wins the title, 11 points ahead of
   Darrell Waltrip
   [bullet.gif] 1989: Rusty Wallace wins the title, 12 points ahead of
   Dale Earnhardt
   [bullet.gif] 1997: Jeff Gordon wins the title, 14 points ahead of Dale
   Jarrett
   [bullet.gif] 1980: Dale Earnhardt wins the title, 19 points ahead of
   Cale Yarborough
   [clear.gif]
   [clear.gif]

   It seems unlikely that a non-Chase driver would intentionally take out
   a championship contender Sunday. Then again, Jeff Gordon says, you
   never know.

   "You don't want to make enemies out there, that's for sure," he says.
   "You don't want to make them all year long where there's a possible
   payback coming at some time. At a crucial moment like this, you
   certainly don't want to do that. You want to have as many friends out
   there as you can."

   And it also seems unlikely that Busch, Johnson or Gordon would try to
   take each other out. As drivers occasionally like to remind us, this is
   not Days of Thunder.

   "I don't think any of the guys racing in the championship would
   intentionally do anything because you've got to live with yourself and
   your conscience when it's all said and done," Gordon says.

   Says Earnhardt: "I don't think anybody thinks somebody is going to take
   somebody out. That's pretty ridiculous. We're all professionals. You
   know, we don't really drive like that. I don't think anybody's that
   crazy. Maybe 10 years ago, but not today."

   Q: Is Homestead a good venue for the finale?

   A: It should be. The track's turns were completely rebuilt before last
   year's race, a move that should produce two positives this weekend.
   First, the teams only have one race's worth of experience plus the
   testing they've done this year at the track, which makes it essentially
   a neutral site. Second, the track's new variable-degree banking,
   designed to make the high side of the track as fast as the low side,
   should allow for lots of passing.

   "The new design of it is fantastic," Jeff Gordon says. "It's aged now a
   year. It's lost a little bit of grip, which is good. But I think, yeah,
   you know, if you look at the experience that all the teams have on this
   racetrack, it is a pretty level playing field."

   Johnson and Gordon finished in the top five at Homestead last year, but
   Busch finished 36th. He admits his lack of competitive laps last year
   puts him at a disadvantage.

   "It definitely is a disadvantage to have the laps that we made last
   year come into play this year," Busch said. "But as far as the outlook
   and the demeanor of our team is to approach this race as if it were a
   brand-new racetrack."

   Q: What is Earnhardt's situation?

   A: Although he's 72 points behind Busch, his chances of winning the
   championship are remote. He would need to leapfrog three strong
   drivers, and he'd need to do so at a track where he doesn't seem to be
   very confident.

   Earnhardt notes that the No. 8 team didn't run very well at the
   revamped track last year and says his team's recent test there "wasn't
   a 100% success."

   "I don't live in a dream world," he says. "I know what the facts are.
   We just got to figure out how to get a better race car before the race
   starts because, frankly, I think we don't have what it takes right now
   as far as the way the test went. The car don't drive exactly the way I
   want it to.

   "We got to work really hard ... to get the car right."

   Q: What's Mark Martin's situation?

   A: It has been fun to watch Martin run through emotions this season —
   tense in the weeks before the Chase, elated to make the Chase,
   disappointed to be caught in a crash at Lowe's Motor Speedway and now
   ... back to happy?

   "It's incredible," Martin says. "You know, I was afraid 2003 ... was
   going to set the tone for the twilight of my career. I was really sick
   about that.

   "It took a lot of hard work by (crew chief) Pat Tryson and everybody at
   Roush Racing to get me in a position where I could go out here and
   battle these guys."

   Good break turns into lead for Sorenstam
   By Doug Ferguson, AP Golf Writer
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Just when it looked like a bad day was about to
   get worse, Annika Sorenstam turned a good break into a birdie that
   changed everything Friday in the season-ending ADT Championship.
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-11-19-inside-annika.jpg] [clear.gif] Annika Sorenstam tees off
   during the second round of the ADT Championship. She set the 36-hold
   record at Trump International. [clear.gif]
   By Rick Silva, AP

   Sorenstam kept pace with a steady charge from Karrie Webb, then pulled
   away with back-to-back birdies late in the second round for a 4-under
   68 that set the 36-hole record at Trump International. She took a
   three-shot lead over Webb, Laura Diaz and Cristie Kerr. (Related item:
   Second-round results)

   "I've got a little lead, but not a comfortable lead at all," said
   Sorenstam, who was at 10-under 134. "On this golf course, it can change
   on one hole."

   It changed for the better on the par-5 ninth.

   Sorenstam was even par for her round, and her body language showed
   utter frustration — she shook her head and slumped her shoulders. When
   she walked off the eighth green, she no longer had the lead. Then, her
   7-wood from 214 yards on No. 9 sailed high and to the right, headed for
   trouble.

   "It was inches from hitting the path and going into the bushes,"
   Sorenstam said. "I saw my mom standing there and she said, 'Are you
   trying to hit me?' It was a good break. It was a momentum shifter."

   Sorenstam hit a wedge into 6 feet for an unlikely birdie that lifted
   her spirits. Four birdies on the back nine gave her a cushion that
   might look even bigger considering who's in front.

   "You don't want to be too much more than three behind going into
   Sunday," Webb said.

   Webb, a two-time winner at the tournament, has avoided big numbers for
   two days and looked particularly sharp in her round of 69 that might
   have been better except for a few silly bogeys — she three-putted from
   below the big ridge on No. 6 and missed the 12th green with a wedge.

   But she is driving it well and giving herself plenty of chances.

   Diaz had a 68 and will play in the final group Saturday with Sorenstam.
   That's not a bad place to be considering that Diaz wasn't even in the
   ADT Championship until she birdied her last two holes a week ago to
   finish second and earn enough money to get into the top 30 on the money
   list.

   An ankle injury has severely interrupted her last two years, but that's
   healthy now, and her confidence is returning. She chipped in for birdie
   on the first hole and played bogey-free the final 13 holes for a 68.

   Diaz doesn't think a three-shot lead by Sorenstam is particularly
   daunting.

   "Annika has obviously proven that she plays really good golf almost
   every time she goes out," Diaz said. "I think we all go out and we just
   try and make as many birdies as we can."

   That's usually not the way anyone thinks at Trump International, one of
   the toughest tests on the LPGA Tour. But with only moderate wind,
   players are able to take aim at the flags and make the most out of the
   pure greens. More than half the field — 16 players — is under par
   through two rounds.

   Sorenstam, Webb, Diaz and Kerr (70) each had at least a share of the
   lead at one point, but Sorenstam made sure she was alone at the top
   with her finish.

   Back-to-back birdies starting on No. 11 gave her the outright lead
   again, and then she built a cushion. Sorenstam had to lay up on the
   494-yard 15th with a stiff breeze in her face, but her sand wedge
   checked up behind the hole, and she made the 4-footer for birdie.

   Then, she hit pitching wedge into 5 feet on the 16th for another birdie
   that extended her lead.

   "Soft little pitching wedge," Sorenstam said. "It was a shot I've been
   working on with Henri (Reis), and it just turned out perfect."

   Along with giving her separation over the pack, Sorenstam dimmed hopes
   of two players — defending champion Meg Mallon and Lorie Kane of Canada
   — who made up a lot of ground.

   Kane turned in the best score of the tournament by making 10 birdies in
   a round of 65, while Mallon holed out for eagle from 143 yards away on
   No. 10 on her way to a 66. Both wound up at 4-under 140.

   "I have a chance," Mallon said.

   Both were six shots behind, and depending on the fickle weather of
   south Florida, both are capable of making a run up the leaderboard. A
   year ago, Mallon overcame a three-shot deficit to Sorenstam in the
   final round to win.

   Kane never imagined she would be in this spot — not after a 75 on
   Thursday and a three-putt bogey from 5 feet on the second hole.

   "I thought, 'Oh my God, here we go again,'" Kane said. "But I think I'm
   headed in the right direction."

   Divots: Karrie Webb has an honorary membership at Trump International,
   and since The Donald is hosting the women this week, she was asked if
   she watched "The Apprentice" on Thursday night. "To be honest with you,
   I watched it in the commercial of CSI," she said. "That's probably
   going to lose me my honorary membership. I don't watch TV to be
   constantly up with shows like that. Is that a good answer?" ... Stacy
   Prammanasudh made five double bogeys in a round of 83, leaving her 27
   shots out of the lead in her ADT Championship debut.

    Fred Hale Sr., 113, right, and his son, Fred Hale Jr. watch the Boston
      Red Sox play in in the World Series in Syracuse, N.Y. Fred Hale Sr.,
          documented as the world's oldest man, died Friday, Nov. 19, 2004

   NEW YORK – Fred Hale Sr., the oldest man in the world according to
   Guinness World Records, has died less than two weeks shy of his 114th
   birthday.

   Hale died in his sleep Friday at an assisted living home near Syracuse,
   New York, after recovering from a bout of pneumonia, Fred Hale III, 51,
   the youngest of Hale's nine grandchildren, said Saturday.

   Hale, one of two children, was born on a farm in New Sharon, Maine, on
   Dec. 1, 1890, before cars and airplanes and in the same year Sioux
   Indians were massacred at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

   "He was 17 or 18 before he saw his first car," his grandson told
   Reuters. "His dad and him heard one was coming to town and went down by
   the fence and waited for the car to come by. He was basically too old
   to serve in World War One. He already had two kids by then."

   Hale worked as a railroad postal carrier, retiring 51 years ago. After
   his wife, Flora, died in 1979, he continued to live independently in
   South Portland, Maine, until he was about 109, when he moved closer to
   his son Fred Hale Jr., now 82.

   He was listed with Guinness as the world's oldest driver when he
   renewed his license at age 104. He gave up driving four years ago.

   "He probably should have given it up a little sooner," his grandson
   said.

   Hale became the world's officially oldest man after Joan Riudavets Moll
   of Spain died on March 5 this year at the age of 114. Guinness lists
   Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper of the Netherlands, who celebrated her
   114th birthday in June, as the world's person.

   Hale is survived by two of his five children, nine grandchildren, 13
   great-grandchildren and 11 great-great- grandchildren.

   His grandson chalked up part of his grandfather's longevity to his New
   England temperament.

   "He was a very even-keeled person," Fred Hale III told Reuters. "A lot
   of people could take a lesson from him, not to get so worked up about
   things."

   Redskins break point barrier in 31-7 defeat of Giants
   By Nate Davis, USATODAY.com
   LANDOVER, Md. — It all came together for the Washington Redskins on
   Sunday. Finally. Clinton Portis rushed for 148 yards and scored two
   touchdowns, and the Washington defense completely shut down the Giants
   offense as the Redskins manhandled New York 31-7 for their fourth win
   of the season.

   By Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP

   It was the type of performance Redskins fans had been waiting for in a
   lost season that began with great optimism, thanks to coach Joe Gibbs'
   return to the sidelines.

   "We had a lot of playmakers tonight," said Gibbs. "I'm happy now I have
   a chance to brag about these guys."

   The Redskins, who had not scored more than 18 points in any game before
   Sunday's win, racked up a 21-0 lead by halftime.

   Portis set the tone on the opening drive, carrying the ball seven times
   for 49 yards and finishing the 93-yard march with a 1-yard touchdown
   run. Early in the second quarter, Portis struck again, taking a 4-yard
   shovel pass from Patrick Ramsey to paydirt and capping a 91-yard drive.

   "I knew the team was depending on me and we finallywent out and gave
   the defense what they wanted, and that was 21 points," said Portis."

   Ramsey hit tight end Robert Royal for six from nine yards out at the
   end of the half.

   "Clinton Portis had a big day," said Gibbs a week after Portis suffered
   through a six-carry, 17-yard performance vs. Pittsburgh and spent much
   of the game on the bench. "I could tell he would because all week he's
   been asking for the ball. After a couple of weeks of us not doing well
   in the running game he felt the need to produce."

   Ramsey easily had his best day of the season, completing 19 of 22
   passes for 174 yards and three touchdowns.

   "I've felt that all season if we can just play consistently, we will be
   a successful offense," said Ramsey. "Finally, today we were able to do
   that. This is the most comfortable I've been in the pocket as a
   Redskin."

   On the other side, Eli Manning, the Giants' prized first-rounder,
   suffered through another long day in his third pro start. The rookie
   finished 12 of 25 for 113 yards through the air, but 48 of those came
   on a pass to Amani Toomer when the game was already out of reach.

   "It's frustrating," said Manning. "I want to go out there, play well
   and try to get some points on the board and keep moving the offense. I
   just need to keep working hard."

   New York running back Tiki Barber never got the ground attack going
   either, limited to 38 yards rushing by a defense that has been the
   Redskins' backbone all season.

   All told, Washington outgained New York 379-145.

   "We physically got whipped up front, on both sides of the ball,"
   remarked Giants coach Tom Coughlin.

   New York fell to 5-7 and its once-promising season is quickly going by
   the wayside.

   "We have talent and it seems that we are not utilizing it," said tight
   end Jeremy Shockey, who criticized the team's recent struggles this
   week and was limited to 23 yards on three catches. "It's frustrating
   because I don't like being an average player in this league but it
   seems like I am now."

   Notes: The Giants' lone touchdown came on a 92-yard kickoff return by
   Derrick Ward in the third quarter. Redskins defensive end Phillip
   Daniels broke his wrist in the second quarter and will be lost for the
   remainder of the season. Royal's TD reception was the first of his
   career.

   Louisville's Petrino not considering other coaching offers
   By Eric Crawford, The Courier-Journal
   LOUISVILLE — University of Louisville football coach Bobby Petrino
   jumped off the coaching carousel Tuesday — but only after the
   Cardinals' regular season came to a complete stop. Petrino released a
   statement saying he won't consider any other coaching jobs, amid
   reports that he was being pursued with new interest by Notre Dame and
   Washington.
   [clear.gif]
   [2004-12-07-inside-petrino.jpg] [clear.gif] Two successful seasons at
   Louisville have made Bobby Petrino a hot commodity. [clear.gif]
   By Bil Haber, AP

   "During the season, I didn't feel it was appropriate to address
   speculation about other coaching vacancies," the coach said in a
   release from the school. "I felt it was important to maintain our focus
   on winning one game at a time. I want to make it clear that I'm not
   interested in any other coaching jobs and am happy at the University of
   Louisville."

   Petrino couldn't be reached for further comment, but U of L athletic
   director Tom Jurich welcomed the news, saying it would further enhance
   the Cardinals' growing reputation in college football.

   "Just about everyone there had him painted gone," Jurich said. "Every
   major job left out there had him penciled into their opening ... I gave
   my pitch to Bobby, but basically he had to come to grips with what he
   wanted to do."

   Petrino, whose current contract runs through 2010 with a base salary of
   $550,000 a year and incentives worth another $200,000, was facing some
   potentially larger financial offers from other schools. Reports out of
   Mississippi said Ole Miss was prepared to offer as much as $1.6
   million. No numbers had been reported in connection with Notre Dame,
   but it likely would have been in the same neighborhood.

   Jurich said that he and Petrino have had some preliminary discussions
   about a new contract but will begin to talk seriously about a new deal
   Wednesday.

   "I'm going to continue to be aggressive with his contract," Jurich
   said. "Some of these schools out there, it's very difficult for me to
   compete with that kind of money. That's one thing we don't have here.
   But we're going to make it as competitive and family-friendly as we
   can."

   Petrino has led U of L to a 10-1 record and a school-record No. 7
   national ranking this season. He is 19-5 in two seasons at U of L.

   A win over Boise State in the Liberty Bowl on New Year's Eve would give
   the Cards' their first-ever top-10 finish in the Associated Press and
   USA TODAY/ESPN coaches' polls. That in turn could lead to a high
   ranking in the preseason next year, U of L's first in the Big East
   Conference.

   And he has ample reason for optimism about next season's team. Petrino
   has a lot of offensive stars returning — including running backs Eric
   Shelton, Michael Bush and Kolby Smith, wideouts Montrell Jones and
   Broderick Clark, quarterback Brian Brohm and four starters on the
   offensive line.

   Petrino said it was something other than money that struck him the most
   as the Cardinals' season wound down.

   "As I stood on the sideline against the University of Cincinnati and
   saw the emotion and feeling of accomplishment on the faces of our
   players, I knew that I had something special at the University of
   Louisville," he said in his statement.

   "I'm very excited about our move into the Big East, the opportunity to
   play in a BCS bowl game and the chance to compete for a national
   championship. ...

   "As I've stated before, Louisville is the perfect place to raise a
   family and I plan for all four of my children to graduate from high
   school in Louisville."

   Petrino had been the subject of job speculation since Florida fired
   coach Ron Zook in October. He was reported to be a leading candidate
   for that job, and after it was filled by Utah's Urban Meyer, he had
   been pursued by Ole Miss and was reported to be under consideration by
   Washington and Notre Dame.

   Although Petrino refused to discuss that speculation during the season,
   he penned a letter to U of L football letter winners stating, "I want
   to ensure you all that I will be staying in Louisville."

   Comments from Ole Miss athletic director Pete Boone on a Mississippi
   radio program Monday night, however, alleged that Petrino was pursuing
   the job at Ole Miss. But Petrino's agent, Russ Campbell, denied Tuesday
   making overtures to Ole Miss and said instead that a "reconnaissance
   team" from the school made repeated attempts to contact Petrino but
   that the coach had no dialogue with any other school.

   "Absolutely, unequivocally, he did not pursue Ole Miss," Campbell said.

   Campbell said that after last year's secret meeting with Auburn and the
   subsequent fallout, Petrino was extremely careful about all job-related
   dealings and comments this year.

   "Particularly in light of his past experience, we were bound and
   determined to handle this and all inquiries about Bobby Petrino in the
   right way," Campbell said. "Ole Miss sent what I call a 'recon team' to
   get in touch with us and ask if he had interest in the job.

   "Our constant response was, 'We cannot engage you on that.' Our
   standard response to all inquiries has been that Bobby will not
   consider any job opportunity — he will not say yes, he will not say no,
   he will not say maybe — we will not engage in a dialogue until the time
   is right to do so."

   Cowboys pull away late in defensive battle with Syracuse
   By Jim O'Connell, The Associated Press
   NEW YORK — Two top-five teams known for their different styles of
   defense were even for 34 minutes. Then Oklahoma State took over and the
   fifth-ranked Cowboys beat No. 4 Syracuse 74-60 on Tuesday night in the
   Jimmy V Classic.

   Graham during the first half. [clear.gif]
   By Julie Jacobson, AP

   "That second half we probably played as well as we can play," Oklahoma
   State coach Eddie Sutton said. "That first half. I told them they
   played like they had never been coached. That first half was one of the
   worst halves I've seen in a long, long time."

   Stephen Graham scored 16 points, including two three-point plays in the
   final 4.50 minutes, for Oklahoma State (6-0), which was able to pull
   away from a 45-all tie with 6:32 to play as the Orange (7-1) couldn't
   hit from the field or the free throw line. (Related item: Game report)

   "That was a tremendous, physical defensive battle," Syracuse coach Jim
   Boeheim said. "We played defensively as well as we can tonight."

   No. 11 Pittsburgh beat Memphis 70-51 in the other game of the
   doubleheader at Madison Square Garden.

   John Lucas hit a three-pointer — his first field goal of the game — to
   break that last tie and start a 17-4 run that included Graham's two big
   plays.

   Ivan McFarlin scored with 2:20 to go to cap the run and give Oklahoma
   State a 62-49 lead.

   "We call ourselves the road warriors and this was a great win on the
   road," Graham said.

   Gerry McNamara hit three three-pointers in the closing 1:23 to get
   Syracuse within 66-60, but the Orange couldn't get any closer.

   McFarlin and Joey Graham each had 16 points for Oklahoma State and
   McFarlin 12 rebounds as the Cowboys finished with a 46-33 advantage on
   the boards.

   "We were worried about how we handle them on the boards and we did a
   good job," Sutton said. "We can really build off this and gain some
   confidence. This is a veteran team that went to the Final Four and they
   have to play like they did last year and they did that in the second
   half."

   Josh Pace had 20 points, two off his career-high, for Syracuse, while
   McNamara had 18 and Hakim Warrick 13. Warrick, a career 64-percent
   free-throw shooter, was just 5-for-13 from the line and Syracuse was
   7-for-22.

   "Offensively, we have to get some help for our three veterans who are
   playing really well," Boeheim said. "If we don't get some help we're
   going to struggle against good teams and Oklahoma State is as good as
   anybody in the country.

   "You can't play a game of this magnitude against a team like Oklahoma
   State and only make seven of 22 free throws."

   The game was a matchup of two of college basketball's winningest
   coaches. Sutton won his 761st, while Boeheim stayed at 683.

   Oklahoma State's physical man-to-man defense and Syracuse's vaunted 2-3
   zone lived up to their billings. Syracuse held a 22-21 halftime lead
   with neither team able to shoot better than 36%.

   It didn't get much better for the offenses in the second half until
   Oklahoma State started to score in transition to break the game open.

   The Cowboys, coming off an 81-29 win over Washington State, kept
   scoring on the break with long passes while holding the Orange to just
   one field goal over a 5-minute stretch late in the second half.

   "In the first half, we were a little too passive against the zone,"
   McFarlin said. "In the second half, we ran the transition really well."

   Oklahoma State was 19-for-30 from the line and the Cowboys scored 20
   points off 14 Syracuse turnovers.

   "We've been shooting free throws well but there were some bricks at
   both ends of the court," Sutton said.

   [trans.gif] Kent agrees to two-year contract with Dodgers
               [black.gif]

   ASSOCIATED PRESS

   3:35 p.m. December 9, 2004

                                                          [041209kent.jpg]
                                                          Associated Press
           All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent agreed Thursday to a two-year
         contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kent, 36, hit .289 with 27
   homers and 107 RBI for Houston in 2004 while making his fourth All-Star
                                                                     team.

   ANAHEIM – All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent agreed Thursday to a
   two-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

   Kent, 36, hit .289 with 27 homers and 107 RBIs for the Houston Astros
   last season and made the NL All-Star team for the fourth time. Kent,
   who set a club record by hitting in 25 straight games, became a free
   agent when Houston declined a $9 million option and opted to pay a
   $700,000 buyout.

   His 278 homers are the most by a second baseman and his seven seasons
   with 100 RBIs tied another mark for the position. He has a .289 career
   average with 302 homers and 1,207 RBIs in 13 seasons.

   The highlight of his 2004 season was a three-run homer in the bottom of
   the ninth inning of Game 5 of the NL championship series, putting the
   Astros within a victory of their first World Series appearance. Houston
   went on to lose the next two games in St. Louis.

   Kent was NL MVP in 2000 and a three-time All-Star with San Francisco.
   He averaged 29 homers in six seasons with the Giants.

   His image was tarnished when he told the Giants during spring training
   in 2002 that he had hurt his wrist while washing his truck. Reports
   later said Kent was hurt in a motorcycle accident.

   Los Angeles made the announcement at the hotel where the winter
   meetings start Friday.

   Majerus headed to Southern California
   From staff and wire reports
   LOS ANGELES — Rick Majerus will come out of retirement to coach
   Southern California's basketball team starting at the end of the
   season, but will begin recruiting for the Trojans immediately.
   [clear.gif]
   Rick Majerus led Utah to 10 NCAA tournaments and one appearance in the
   championship game. [clear.gif] Rick Majerus led Utah to 10 NCAA

   He will fill the assistant's job vacated when Jim Saia was promoted to
   interim head coach after Henry Bibby was fired.

   Although he will be active in recruiting, Majerus will not be on the
   bench for games and isn't expected to attend practices. He will take
   over as head coach April 1.

   The former Utah coach, who retired last January in his 15th season with
   the Utes because of health reasons, was signed by USC on Wednesday.

   He immediately resigned his post as an ESPN basketball analyst to avoid
   a conflict of interest.

   "I'm looking forward to my return to coaching," Majerus said in a
   statement. "I missed it more than I ever imagined. There was no
   coaching opportunity in America except the USC job that I would have
   left ESPN for."

   He signed a multiyear contract. His salary was not disclosed.

   ESPN executive vice president Mark Shapiro said the network didn't want
   to be a pawn in Majerus' talks with USC officials to succeed recently
   fired Henry Bibby. "We don't want Rick to leave. We love him," Shapiro
   said. "That's why it's irritating that after just a month of service
   he's ... out the door."

   Shapiro added, "We don't want to be in the coaching carousel business.
   Why can't (football coach) Pete Carroll coach both teams? We wish Rick
   nothing but the best and hope he wins a national title at USC."

   The school fired Bibby last week four games into his ninth season, and
   gave Saia the job on an interim basis for the rest of the season. The
   Trojans are 1-1 since Saia took over. Bibby had a 131-111 record at USC
   and took the Trojans to three NCAA tournaments.

   The 57-year-old Majerus was in the first year of a 5-year deal with
   ESPN and was expected to pay a negotiated buyout to the network. He
   worked his last game for the network Monday night in Philadelphia,
   where Wake Forest beat Temple.

   A coach-in-waiting arrangement for Majerus would not fly with ESPN,
   Shapiro said. "If a coach accepted a job for next season and stayed on
   our air, it could interfere with their ability to cover the sport
   objectively," he said. "That's not a risk we want or would ask him to
   take."

   Majerus will have to pay a $400,000 penalty for leaving early in his
   multiyear contract. Majerus said he earned about $1.2 million a year at
   Utah.

   "I'm not going to comment on the penalty," said IMG's Sandy Montag,
   Majerus' agent. "But Rick has told a number of people this is the only
   job he'd leave broadcasting for. He's always had a soft spot for USC.
   He wants to stay with ESPN for the rest of the season, but if he were
   to accept the USC job during the season, it probably would be a
   conflict of interest even though he wouldn't be taking over until the
   end of the season."

   Majerus coached Utah to the national championship game in 1998, losing
   to Kentucky, one of the school's 10 NCAA tournament appearances during
   his tenure. His other coaching stints were at Ball State, Marquette and
   with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks as an assistant.

   Majerus said he's looking forward to joining USC football coach Pete
   Carroll in the athletic department.

   "If he needs a Gilbert Brown-type player on occasion, maybe I'll wander
   by football practice and plug up the offensive line," the portly coach
   said, referring to the 340-pound former Green Bay defensive tackle.

   Athletic director Mike Garrett said: "This is an amazing day for the
   USC men's basketball program. Rick Majerus is one of America's great
   coaches and he is one of the sport's true personalities."

   The 2004 PGA Tour by the numbers, heading into this week's
   season-ending Tour Championship:

   0 â Number of stroke-play events won by Tiger Woods, whose only victory
   this year came at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. The last
   time Woods, who has 40 career victories, captured a stroke-play event
   was the WGC-American Express Championship nearly 13 months ago. Woods'
   last victory in a full-field event was July 6, 2003, at the Western
   Open.

   1 â World ranking of Vijay Singh, who ended Woods' 264-week reign in
   the top spot.

   1.5 â Reported cost, in millions of dollars, of the Woods-Elin
   Nordegren wedding in Barbados on Oct. 5.

   2 â Number of runner-up finishes at majors by Ernie Els, the No. 2
   player in the world. Besides losing the Masters by one stroke and the
   British Open in a playoff, Els tied for ninth at the U.S. Open and tied
   for fourth at the PGA Championship. Els still managed to win three
   times on tour and twice overseas.

   4 â Number of tour players invited to the Woods wedding, which had
   Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Oprah Winfrey on the guest list.
   Two of the players invited, Mark O'Meara and John Cook, made it to the
   ceremony. Notah Begay III missed the wedding with a back injury, and
   Charles Howell III opted to play the Las Vegas tour stop in an
   unsuccessful attempt to play his way into the Tour Championship.

   5 â Number of rookies to win this year â the highest total since the
   tour began tracking such things in 1970. Todd Hamilton (British Open,
   Honda Classic), Zach Johnson (BellSouth Classic), Vaughn Taylor
   (Reno-Tahoe Open), Andre Stolz (Michelin Championship at Las Vegas) and
   Ryan Palmer (Funai Classic) combined for six victories.

   6 â Lowest finish at a major by Phil Mickelson, who birdied the final
   hole to win the Masters. Mickelson settled for second at the U.S. Open,
   double bogeying the 71st hole to fall out of a tie for the lead,
   finished third (and one stroke out of a playoff) at the British Open
   and placed sixth at the PGA Championship.

   7 â Number of times Hamilton failed at qualifying school before earning
   his tour card at age 38.

   8 â Ranking that Davis Love III has on the tour money list â the
   highest for anybody who hasn't won a tournament this year. Love had two
   seconds and one third in 23 starts. Over his career, Love has 18
   victories and 26 runner-up finishes.

   9 â Number of victories this year by Singh, matching Woods' career-best
   total in 2002. With a victory at the Tour Championship, Singh would
   become the first player since Sam Snead in 1950 to pile up a
   double-digit victory total in one season.

   10 â Number of first-time winners on tour this year.

   12 â Number of players who have been No. 1 since the world rankings
   began in 1986. The dashing dozen: Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros,
   Greg Norman, Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, Fred Couples, Nick Price, Tom
   Lehman, Woods, Ernie Els, David Duval and Singh. Lehman had the
   shortest stay at No. 1, keeping the seat warm the week of April 20,
   1997.

   14 â Age of Michelle Wie when she came within one stroke of making the
   cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii.

   24 â Age of Adam Scott, the youngest player in this year's Tour
   Championship. Scott is one of seven players who have more victories
   than Woods this year. The magnificent seven: Singh, Els, Mickelson,
   Scott, Hamilton, Stewart Cink and Sergio Garcia.

   26 â Ranking on the money list for The Woodlands resident K.J. Choi,
   earning him his third consecutive Tour Championship invitation.

   30 â Number of starts this year by Colonial champion Steve Flesch â the
   most of anybody playing in the Tour Championship.

   30 â Number of players who have hit drives officially measured at 400
   yards or longer. The longest official drive of the year belongs to Love
   (476 yards). Unlikely members of the 400 club: J.L. Lewis, Justin
   Leonard, Ben Curtis, Mike Weir, Kirk Triplett, John Huston and
   50-year-old Peter Jacobsen. John Daly's longest official drive of the
   year, incidentally, is 399 yards.

   35 â Number of victories (out of 47 events) that the 30 players in the
   Tour Championship have this year.

   43 â Number of majors as a pro it took for Mickelson to win for the
   first time.

   60 â Minimum number of guesses it would take for the sane fan to hit on
   the tour's leader in all-around ranking. The sum of Geoff Ogilvy's game
   is less than the whole of its parts, judging by his No. 61 standing on
   the money list. The talented Ogilvy, 27, has never won on the tour or
   overseas. Given his ability, he could be a steal in one of next year's
   fantasy golf leagues.

   76 â Final-round score shot by Singh at the PGA Championship â the
   highest for a winner since the season's fourth major went to a
   stroke-play format in 1958. The last player to capture a major with a
   higher final-round score was Reg Whitcome, who secured the 1938 British
   Open at Royal St. George's with a 78.

   78.727 â Average final-round score on the par-70 Shinnecock Hills at
   the U.S. Open. Only one player, former Shell Houston Open champion
   Robert Allenby, matched par on the half-baked United States Golf
   Association setup. Twenty-eight players, including Els, failed to break
   80.

   132 â Tour-record number of consecutive tournaments in which Woods has
   finished in the money. Only seven players have a current streak in
   double digits: Singh (23), Chris DiMarco (19), Paul Goydos (13), Els
   (12), Carl Pettersson (12), Rod Pampling (10) and David Toms (10).

   250-1 â Bookmakers odds of Hamilton winning the British Open at Royal
   Troon.

   299 â World ranking of John Daly, who was sandwiched between Tomohiro
   Kondo and Henrik Stenson, when he teed it up in February at the Buick
   Invitational. Daly won a playoff with Chris Riley and Luke Donald to
   end a victory drought that went back to the 1995 British Open.

   Henman reaches last eight

   Tim Henman smiles after reaching the quarter-finals of the US Open

   Day eight photos
   Latest results

   Tim Henman reached the US Open quarter-finals for the first time after
   German Nicolas Kiefer retired with injury.

   Henman battled back from a poor start and had victory in his sights
   with the match poised at 6-7 6-3 6-1 6-7 3-0 before Kiefer damaged a
   tendon.

   The German complained he felt no power in his right wrist after a
   serve.

   Henman, celebrating his 30th birthday, will now face Slovakia's Dominik
   Hrbaty on Wednesday for a place in the last four at Flushing Meadows.

   "It's a strange way to win a match after I'd been fighting so hard,"
   admitted Henman.

   It was a tough decision because I wanted to finish the match

   Nicolas Kiefer

   "But I thought I'll take it after we'd been playing the way we had.

   "Kiefer told me he felt something pop in his wrist and it was a tough
   break for him."

   The German 27-year-old will now have further tests to determine the
   extent of his injury.

   "I hit a reflex volley and when I tried to hit a big serve on the next
   point I couldn't hold the racket," said Kiefer.

   "It was a tough decision because I wanted to finish the match."

   Henman's own progress at Flushing Meadows was almost undone by a back
   injury but he has shown great determination to pull off his best-ever
   US Open performance.

   The fifth seed is now the firm favourite for his quarter-final tie and
   Henman is cautiously optimistic.

   "It's funny how things have changed," said Henman. "I've played some
   good tennis and that gives me confidence going into the latter stages.

   Agassi sets up Federer tie

   "It seems when I release the pressure on myself - and it took a back
   injury to do it - then I play my best tennis.

   "Everything so far has been a bonus and this is a good way to finish my
   birthday."

   The match on Arthur Ashe Court had swung back and forth in favour of
   both players.

   Henman found himself 4-0 down in the opening set as his serve deserted
   him.

   And despite recovering to break Kiefer twice and saving a set-point, he
   could not prevent the in-form German wrapping up the tie-break 7-5.

   Kiefer looked to be in control as he grabbed a break to go 3-1 up in
   the second set.

   But a dogged Henman notched up 10 straight games to take the next two
   sets with ease.

   Gamewatch: The match as it happened

   The fourth set was an intense encounter and Kiefer let his anger get
   the better of him as he bitterly disputed a foot-fault and a line-call.

   However, the German was able to keep a cool head to edge the tie-break
   7-5 with some searing backhands and force a fifth set.

   It was Henman who shook off a shaky start to race to a 3-0 lead in the
   decider.

   But the crowd were denied a thrilling finale as Kiefer decided to
   retire after a lengthy consultation with his trainer.

   Makelele ends France career

   Claude Makelele

   Claude Makelele career stats

   France midfielder Claude Makelele has announced his retirement from
   international football.

   The 31-year-old said he wanted to focus on his club career with
   Chelsea.

   "I shall be 33 in 2006. It's time to give way to the young generation
   of players like Benoit Pedretti," he told French newspaper L'Equipe.

   "They need experience before the next World Cup. My future is with
   Chelsea," added Makelele, who has been an ever-present for his club
   this season.

   Makelele was called up by new coach Raymond Domenech for the recent
   World Cup qualifiers, but he did not play in the second game against
   the Faroe Islands.

   "I think that a player like me can not afford to answer international
   calls if he is not going to play," he said.

   "I felt it was my duty to be part of the first two games after our Euro
   2004 failure but I had already decided to quit.

   "I wanted to talk to Domenech looking into each other's eyes. We know
   each other well and he understood my situation."

   Pakistan roll over Kenya
   By Scott Heinrich
   BBC Sport at Edgbaston
   Champions Trophy: Pakistan 95-3 (18.4 overs) beat Kenya 94 (32 overs)
   by seven wickets
   Scorecard

   Afridi recorded career-best figures of 5-11

   Shahid Afridi recorded career-best figures of 5-11 to inspire Pakistan
   to an easy seven-wicket win over Kenya in the Champions Trophy at
   Edgbaston.

   Kenya were bowled out for 94 after a horrendous collapse saw their last
   nine wickets fall for 27 runs.

   Afridi combined with Shoaib Malik (3-15) as five Kenya batsmen made
   ducks.

   Pakistan knocked off the runs in the 19th over to bundle Kenya out of
   the tournament and set up their clash with India on Sunday.

   Yasir Hameed (41), Malik and Afridi perished in the run-chase, but
   there was only ever one winner of this tournament's latest absurdly
   one-sided group contest.

   As has been customary in the Champions Trophy, the toss-winning
   captain, in this case Inzamam-ul-Haq, elected to field first.

   Rana Naved, preferred ahead of Shoaib Akhtar for new-ball duties, got
   Pakistan off to the right start with the removal of Ravindu Shah,
   cutting to Afridi in the covers, in the second over.

   But Kennedy Otieno and Maurice Ouma put the setback to one side, the
   former crashing Mohammad Sami for two off-side fours in one over.

   Ouma, impressive on debut against India earlier in the week, warmed to
   the task as well and the pair put on a promising 65 runs together
   before rain forced a 20-minute break.

   Shoaib failed to take any wickets against Kenya

   Inzamam made a double bowling change when play resumed, a move which
   changed the complexion of the match.

   Shoaib, who had looked short of pace when given a bowl, made way for
   off-spinner Malik, while leg-spinner Afridi, who went on to claim the
   man of the match award, relieved the relatively expensive Abdul Razzaq.

   Kenya promptly fell like playing cards as their plight against the
   spinning ball was embarrassingly exposed, with six of the batsmen
   failing to protect their stumps.

   Afridi struck first to have Ouma caught behind off a bottom edge, and
   Malik accounted for both Otieno (lbw for 33) and Steve Tikilo (bowled
   for a duck) in the same over.

   Kenya then fell to 78-6 when Thomas Odoya and Brijal Patel were bowled
   off-stump by Afridi, offering no shot and half-a-shot respectively.

   Similar fates befell both Ragheb Aga and Malhar Patel before a sharp
   piece of fielding by Yasir at silly mid-off ran out Martin Suji as he
   tried to retreat behind the popping crease.

   A convincing win and getting a higher NRR than India was great
   From IIDM
   Have your say on TMS

   Hitesh Modi (18 not out) finally ran out of partners when Peter Ongondo
   was bowled, offering Afridi his second five-wicket haul and Kenya their
   lowest score against Pakistan.

   Afridi and Malik mirrored their match-winning demolition job in
   Amsterdam recently, where seven shared wickets helped skittle India for
   127.

   Pakistan came out with flashing blades as openers Yaair and Imran
   Farhat chose to deal with the miniscule chase on the front foot.

   Yasir was the main aggressor, outnumbering his partner by six
   boundaries to one in the first 50 runs, but Farhat showcased his
   stroke-playing by hoicking Ongondo high over the long-off rope.

   Yasir, who was given a life early on by Tikolo at second slip, ran out
   of luck when driving at Suji and nicking behind 25 runs short of the
   winning line.

   Tikolo redeemed himself by pouching Malik at short cover for a duck,
   and Aga claimed his second scalp when Afridi misjudged was bowled,
   leaving him two short of 4,000 one-day runs.

   Farhat remained unbeaten on 38 when Razzaq crashed a cover-drive to the
   fence to administer Kenya¿s last rites.

   It was a sad end for the 2003 World Cup semi-finalists, but Pakistan
   will return to Edgbaston on Sunday full of confidence they can get past
   their arch-rivals and advance to the semi-finals.

   Gatlin outguns Greene

   Justin Gatlin (left) powers ahead of Maurice Greene in Yokohama Gatlin
   (left) left Greene in his wake

   Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin justified his new status with a
   comfortable victory in Yokohama, Japan.

   The American clocked 9.97 seconds to finish well clear of compatriot
   Leonard Scott, who ran 10.14secs.

   Olympic bronze medallist Maurice Greene could only manage fifth behind
   Japan's Nobuharu Asahara and retiring Namibian Frank Fredericks.

   "I was the slowest starter but it's the last race of the season and I
   had to go out there and do it," said Gatlin.

   Academy: Be a sprint king with Gatlin

   Greene, the 2000 Olympic champion, blamed jet lag and a false start for
   his poor run but said he was confident of regaining his number one
   status next year.

   It was the last competitive outing for the 36-year-old Fredericks,
   twice an Olympic silver medallist over 100m.

   "Frank Fredericks is one of the foundations of track and field," Gatlin
   added. "Being in his last race was an honour for me."

   Farewells

   German long jumper Heike Drechsler and high jumper Inha Babakova of the
   Ukraine also bade farewell to athletics.

   Drechsler, 39, twice an Olympic champion, finished fifth in the long
   jump.

   Former world champion Babakova, 37, was second to Russia's Olympic
   champion Yelena Slesarenko in her event.

   Grandstand discussion area:
   Have Your Say on Athletics

   China's Olympic 110m hurdles champion Liu Xiang won his duel with
   American Allen Johnson, who failed to qualify for the Athens final
   after falling.

   Liu clocked 13.13 secs, ahead of Jamaican Maurice Wignall (13.33) and
   Johnson (13.41).

   The highlight for most of the 49,810 fans in the International Stadium
   was the homecoming of Olympic hammer champion Koji Murofushi.

   Murofishi, awarded the gold in Athens after the disqualification of
   Hungary's Adrian Annus for drug-test violations, triumphed with a
   winning effort of 83.15m.

   Beckham may miss Euro tie

   David Beckham

   Beckham rebuffs crisis talk

   David Beckham is a doubt for Real Madrid's Champions League match
   against Roma on Tuesday after missing training on Sunday with a virus.

   The England captain was substituted 15 minutes into the second half of
   Real's loss at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.

   Coach Mariano Garcia Remon said he took Beckham off because he looked
   tired.

   "Garcia Remon will not know until Monday afternoon if he can count on
   the midfielder," a statement on the club website revealed.

   However, there was good news for Garcia Remon as playmaker Zinedine
   Zidane and striker Michael Owen were both able to take part in
   training.

   England international Owen should be available, although Zidane is
   unlikely to feature as he recovers from a dislocated shoulder.

   Gibbs
   Parcells and Gibbs shake hands after another bruising showdown

   Bill Parcells' Dallas Cowboys beat the Joe Gibbs-coached Washington
   Redskins 21-18 in a classic encounter on Monday.

   Terry Glenn scored the winning touchdown early in the fourth quarter.

   Running back Richie Anderson's pass to Glenn made his first career
   completion a memorable one as it gave Dallas a 21-10 lead the Redskins
   could not catch.

   It was the first meeting between veteran coaches Parcells and Gibbs in
   14 years, with the former continuing his domination of the rivalry.

   Parcells, who has a reputation for calling inventive plays, has now won
   12 of their 18 meetings, including the last seven.

   And Dallas (2-1) have now won 13 of their last 14 games against
   Washington (1-2).

   It's huge (the win), it's big for us

   Richie Anderson
   Dallas Cowboys

   Anderson did not even play last week but was vital in the win, catching
   two passes himself for 41 yards and rushing for 20 yards on four
   carries.

   "It's a play we worked on all week," Anderson said. "I'm just thankful
   (Glenn) got in there.

   "I just try to make plays when I'm in there. It's fun to execute.

   "It's huge (the win), it's big for us."

   The Cowboys won despite being out-gained 380-287 in total yards and
   managing just 50 yards rushing.

   Gardner brace

   Vinny Testaverde went just 14-for-29 for 214 yards, but he did hit
   Jason Witten with a 10-yard TD strike early in the third quarter to
   give the Cowboys a 14-3 lead.

   Eddie George scored Dallas' other touchdown on a one-yard run in the
   first quarter.

   Redskins quarterback Mark Brunell struggled early but finished with
   stats of 25-for-43 for 325 yards and two touchdowns to Rod Gardner, a
   one-yard toss in the third quarter and a 15-yard completion with 4:40
   to play.

   A 19-yard John Hall field goal and a Taylor Jacobs two-point conversion
   reception accounted for the home team's other points.

   Mourinho makes plea to Uefa

   CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP E

   Chelsea boss and ex-Porto manager Jose Mourinho

   Chelsea 3-1 Porto

   Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has appealed to Uefa not to punish Porto
   after one of their fans spat at him before their Champions League match
   on Wednesday.

   The fan was thrown out but Porto may face charges from Uefa as a
   result.

   However, ex-Porto boss Mourinho said: "This was a minor incident
   compared to the fantastic reception I received from their fans.

   "It would be a great shame if this very isolated incident was allowed
   to ruin their previously excellent reputation."

   Mourinho has written a letter, published on Chelsea's website, to Uefa
   chief executive Lars Christer Olsson and he urges the governing body to
   show restraint over the incident.

   Two more Porto fans were ejected from Stamford Bridge for anti-social
   behaviour.

   It would take a disaster for us not to be in the next stage of the
   tournament

   Jose Mourinho

   "I am asking that the good name of the Porto supporters should not be
   tarnished by the actions of one or two individuals," Mourinho added.

   The former Porto coach shrugged off the incident after the match.

   "I can understand some people love me and some don't love me but that
   is just life," he said.

   "Unfortunately, these things happen. But there were also many people
   who wanted photos and paid me compliments."

   Mourinho left Porto in the summer after leading the Portuguese side to
   Champions League glory.

   Goals by Alexei Smertin, Didier Drogba and John Terry gave Chelsea
   victory and Mourinho is now confident his side have almost qualified
   for the knockout stages after an opening win over Paris Saint Germain.

   "We have got six points and we are in a fantastic position to go to the
   next stage," said Mourinho.

   "We have beaten the European champions who are unbeaten away in seven.

   Teamwork

   "We broke down a few walls and we are in fantastic condition - it would
   take a disaster for us not to be in the next stage of the tournament."

   Mourinho paid tribute to the teamwork of his expensively-assembled
   squad.

   "We still have to work to improve but I have to say that the mentality
   of my team is absolutely fantastic. We play as a team for every moment
   of the game," he said.

   "In most of the big teams in Europe, where the big players are, some of
   them think a bit more about themselves and less about the team.

   "It's important to choose not only the players but also their
   characters. In big teams, you sometimes make mistakes and get the wrong
   personalities.

   "But we have the right ones here and it's amazing to see how my players
   are fighting in every match. That's why no one has been able to beat us
   for nine matches."

   Ward's two HRs power Pirates
   Fogg impressive again in 5-1 win vs. Brewers
   Tuesday, August 31, 2004
   By Robert Dvorchak, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

   MILWAUKEE -- First baseman Daryle Ward admitted that the St. Louis
   Cardinals had his number over the weekend. So it was a refreshing
   change just to see a team that wasn't dressed in red.

                           Pirates Report: 8/31/04

       Stats Geek: Triple vision/Jack Wilson has shot at old tradition
     __________________________________________________________________

   "We're just happy not to see them. They're playing so well, that's not
   the type of team that you want to go up against right now," he said.

   Ward hit two home runs, drove in all five of his team's runs and got on
   base five times last night as the Pirates rebounded for a 5-1 win
   against the Milwaukee Brewers last night at Miller Park. And Josh Fogg
   took a shutout into the seventh inning as he continued his string of
   impressive starts. Not bad turnarounds for Ward, who started the season
   in the minors, and Fogg, who started the season 0-4 with a double-digit
   ERA.

   Ward hit a two-run homer in the first after Jack Wilson singled to
   right, and it carried with it some significance. The Pirates had not
   held a lead in a game since Wednesday against the Diamondbacks at PNC
   Park. They were never in front of the Cardinals, who had administered
   seven of the Pirates' previous eight losses.

   "I just know it was 3-0 every first inning with the Cardinals. It's
   kind of tough to win that way. We want to be the ones to get on top,"
   Ward said. "Those guys pitch real well. That's one reason why they win
   so much. They know exactly how they're going to get guys out. Here, you
   have a little more a chance."

   Ward also drilled a three-run shot in the seventh to provide some
   breathing room. Although he had batted just .220 in the first 12 games
   since he returned from the disabled list, he has 14 homers and 48 RBIs
   in 54 games.

   The Pirates had lost eight of their previous 10 games, including three
   in a row to the Cardinals, so something had to give in this one. The
   Brewers had lost 11 in a row and were 10-32 since the All-Star break,
   when they were four games over .500. With the loss last night, the
   streak is the worst since the Brewers joined the National League. Their
   run in the ninth off reliever Jose Mesa was their first in 24 innings.

   Home-plate umpire Jim Joyce issued a warning to both benches after Fogg
   threw a pitch high and tight to Brewers starter Ben Hendrickson in the
   third. Hendrickson, who spent most of the season in Class AAA, had
   plunked Jason Bay and Ward with pitches.

   The Pirates are in a stretch of playing the Brewers and Astros
   exclusively for 15 games. A Pirates-Brewers series at this time of the
   season may be as meaningless as it gets, especially without Randall
   Simon to influence the sausage races. There are no playoff
   implications, and neither team has been above .500 for 11 seasons and
   counting. The Pirates would have to play at a .613 pace the rest of the
   way just to break even.

   At the tail end of August, with 31 games remaining, the approach
   Pirates manager Lloyd McClendon is preaching is the same as it was in
   the beginning -- work to get better and be professional about it. Jobs
   and contracts for next year are at stake.

   "I'm not going to start naming names in the paper. Guys know they have
   to play. They have to perform," McClendon said. "The days of giving
   jobs away are gone, too. You earn them."

   Ward and Fogg, however, fall into the evaluation category. The Pirates
   have to decide if Ward can be the answer at first base and if Fogg, who
   has evened his record to 9-9 with an impressive August, is worth what
   he'll cost them in arbitration.

   McClendon saw no need for a symbolic regrouping coming off the losses
   to the Cardinals.

   "Why? They kicked our [tails]. What are we going to do? Crawl in a
   hole? Quit?" he said. "Go out [to the clubhouse] and ask anybody if
   they're going to quit and lay down. I think it's going to be a
   resounding 'No.' "

   The answer came where it counted most -- on the field. And hopefully,
   everyone can stop talk about St. Louis.

   "I'm moving on," McClendon said with a wry smile. "Let somebody else
   talk about how good they are."

   Kirui grabs Delhi gold

   Paul Kirui
   Kirui put in a late burst for a comfortable victory

   Kenya's Paul Kirui produced a telling gap in the dying minutes of the
   world half-marathon to win gold in Delhi.

   Kirui also spearheaded Kenya to team gold, while Tanzanian teenager
   Fabiano Joseph grabbed double silver in both the individual and team
   awards.

   China's Sun Yingjie produced a similar late burst in the women's race
   to hold off silver medallist Lydia Cheromei and Constantina Tomescu in
   third place.

   Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan, though, struggled late on to finish fourth.

   Kirui, who finished second a year ago, looked at ease throughout the
   race before opening a 150m gap to beat Joseph in a winning time of one
   hour two minutes and 15 seconds.

   Qatar's Kenya-born Ahmad Abdullah Hassan, formerly known as Robert
   Chipkurui, came third with early leader John Cheruiyot Korir of Kenya
   fourth.

   Afterwards Kirui said: "We spoke [his Kenyan team] as we ran and
   decided I was the best placed to move ahead."

   In the women's event, Sun won in a time of 68.40, making a sprightly
   return three months after fracturing her collarbone.

   Ethiopia took victory in the women's team event.

   Big chance for Button?

   Jenson Button is hopeful of a strong race in BAR's 100th Grand Prix
   Button is hopeful of a strong race in BAR's 100th Grand Prix

   Jenson Button came his closest yet to an elusive first Grand Prix
   victory in China, and Japan this weekend gives him another chance to
   break his duck.

   Button's BAR team are celebrating their 100th Grand Prix at the
   stunning Suzuka track, for which engine supplier Honda always provides
   a boost in power.

   "I am really looking forward to the Japanese Grand Prix," said Button.

   "We have had some fantastic results this season and hopefully they will
   continue at Suzuka."

   BAR drivers Button and Takuma Sato finished fourth and sixth at Suzuka
   last year, when they were less genuinely competitive than now.

   And Button's performance in China, when he beat McLaren's Kimi
   Raikkonen into second place and finished just behind race winner Rubens
   Barrichello's Ferrari, will have raised hopes still further.

   Suzuka is a very challenging circuit and you have to take risks

   Fernando Alonso

   Lap Suzuka with Jarno Trulli

   That second place came at exactly the right time, for BAR are bidding
   to beat Renault to second place in the constructors' championship and
   had appeared to be slipping back a little.

   But the return of their Front Torque Transfer (FTT) braking system,
   albeit with modifications to ensure its legaility after it was banned
   in a different form earlier in the year, seems to have improved the
   car.

   And Button believes Suzuka's twists and turns could give the BAR and
   its FTT another chance to shine.

   "Our car changes direction very well, which is important for the
   particular characteristics of this circuit," he said.

   Suzuka is one of F1's most comprehensive tests of car and driver and
   until recently Renault would have been favoured to have the edge on BAR
   there.

   But the car has lost its edge in recent races, and Renault will suffer
   for their comparative lack of power at Suzuka.

   Fernando Alonso at last year's Japanese Grand Prix
   Alonso thinks Suzuka is F1's second best track

   On top of that, it remains to be seen whether replacing Jarno Trulli -
   who will be racing for his new team Toyota in the final two races of
   the year - was a smart move on the part of team boss Flavio Briatore.

   Trulli's replacement, Jacques Villeneuve, struggled badly in China and
   Renault need results from him if they are to close the nine-point gap
   to BAR.

   Team-mate Fernando Alonso says he has "more motivation than ever" to
   beat BAR.

   But the Spaniard, like most of his rivals, will need no extra
   persuasion to take on the challenges of Suzuka.

   The Japanese track may be situated in the middle of an amusement park,
   but it provides a thrill greater than any rollercoaster ride.

   Suzuka has a unique figure-of-eight layout and some drivers believe its
   challenge surpasses even that of Spa.

   It features some of the most difficult sections of race track anywhere
   in the world, as well as one of the sport's most dangerous corners -
   130R, which is taken flat out at more than 180mph.

   "After Spa, I always find Suzuka the nicest place to drive," Alonso
   says.

   Jarno Trulli
   Trulli makes his debut for new team Toyota this weekend

   "It is a very challenging circuit for the drivers. It is technical, so
   you have to work hard to get the car right with a good front end for
   the changes of direction, and a stable rear so you can have the
   confidence to attack the high speed corners.

   "The other thing about Suzuka, though, is that you have to take risks
   in the corners - and all drivers like that. You push harder in most
   corners and a lot of them are blind on the exit, so you really need to
   have confidence in the car.

   "All of it is challenging, but the Esses are the most different section
   to what we have seen so far this year.

   "You have 10-15 seconds of continuously changing direction, and that is
   very hard physically for the driver - you cannot relax at all and you
   are never running straight, so it is very demanding on your fitness.

   "In terms of line, there is only one way through the sequence for a
   really quick lap, and you need to find the perfect position to take the
   corner you are approaching and the one that follows it as well."

   Both Renault and BAR, though, are well aware that in terms of ultimate
   competitiveness they lie only third and fourth in F1 right now.

   Michael Schumacher holds off Renault's Jarno Trulli with a broken front
   wing on his Ferrari
   Schumacher drove a terrible race in Japan last year

   Button was only able to beat Raikkonen's McLaren in China because the
   Finn's ultimate pace was hampered by being stuck behind Barrichello
   when the Ferrari was struggling with its tyres.

   That meant Raikkonen was still within range of Button when McLaren
   tried - and failed in - a clever tactical ploy in an attempt to beat
   Barrichello.

   All things being equal, though, it is Ferrari and McLaren who will be
   expected to battle for the win.

   Barrichello is on a hat-trick after two wins in a row, and the
   Brazilian's confidence will be sky high.

   But as long as Michael Schumacher does not repeat the catalogue of
   errors he made in China - and indeed in Japan last year - he must be
   favourite at a track he adores.

   stunning Suzuka track, for which engine supplier Honda always provides
   a boost in power.

   "I am really looking forward to the Japanese Grand Prix," said Button.

   "We have had some fantastic results this season and hopefully they will
   continue at Suzuka."

   BAR drivers Button and Takuma Sato finished fourth and sixth at Suzuka
   last year, when they were less genuinely competitive than now.

   And Button's performance in China, when he beat McLaren's Kimi
   Raikkonen into second place and finished just behind race winner Rubens
   Barrichello's Ferrari, will have raised hopes still further.

   Suzuka is a very challenging circuit and you have to take risks

   Fernando Alonso

   That second place came at exactly the right time, for BAR are bidding
   to beat Renault to second place in the constructors' championship and
   had appeared to be slipping back a little.

   But the return of their Front Torque Transfer (FTT) braking system,
   albeit with modifications to ensure its legaility after it was banned
   in a different form earlier in the year, seems to have improved the
   car.

   And Button believes Suzuka's twists and turns could give the BAR and
   its FTT another chance to shine.

   "Our car changes direction very well, which is important for the
   particular characteristics of this circuit," he said.

   Suzuka is one of F1's most comprehensive tests of car and driver and
   until recently Renault would have been favoured to have the edge on BAR
   there.

   But the car has lost its edge in recent races, and Renault will suffer
   for their comparative lack of power at Suzuka.

   On top of that, it remains to be seen whether replacing Jarno Trulli -
   who will be racing for his new team Toyota in the final two races of
   the year - was a smart move on the part of team boss Flavio Briatore.

   Trulli's replacement, Jacques Villeneuve, struggled badly in China and
   Renault need results from him if they are to close the nine-point gap
   to BAR.

   Team-mate Fernando Alonso says he has "more motivation than ever" to
   beat BAR.

   But the Spaniard, like most of his rivals, will need no extra
   persuasion to take on the challenges of Suzuka.

   The Japanese track may be situated in the middle of an amusement park,
   but it provides a thrill greater than any rollercoaster ride.

   Suzuka has a unique figure-of-eight layout and some drivers believe its
   challenge surpasses even that of Spa.

   It features some of the most difficult sections of race track anywhere
   in the world, as well as one of the sport's most dangerous corners -
   130R, which is taken flat out at more than 180mph.

   "After Spa, I always find Suzuka the nicest place to drive," Alonso
   says.

   Trulli makes his debut for new team Toyota this weekend

   "It is a very challenging circuit for the drivers. It is technical, so
   you have to work hard to get the car right with a good front end for
   the changes of direction, and a stable rear so you can have the
   confidence to attack the high speed corners.

   "The other thing about Suzuka, though, is that you have to take risks
   in the corners - and all drivers like that. You push harder in most
   corners and a lot of them are blind on the exit, so you really need to
   have confidence in the car.

   "All of it is challenging, but the Esses are the most different section
   to what we have seen so far this year.

   "You have 10-15 seconds of continuously changing direction, and that is
   very hard physically for the driver - you cannot relax at all and you
   are never running straight, so it is very demanding on your fitness.

   "In terms of line, there is only one way through the sequence for a
   really quick lap, and you need to find the perfect position to take the
   corner you are approaching and the one that follows it as well."

   Both Renault and BAR, though, are well aware that in terms of ultimate
   competitiveness they lie only third and fourth in F1 right now.

   Michael Schumacher holds off Renault's Jarno Trulli with a broken front
   wing on his Ferrari
   Schumacher drove a terrible race in Japan last year

   Button was only able to beat Raikkonen's McLaren in China because the
   Finn's ultimate pace was hampered by being stuck behind Barrichello
   when the Ferrari was struggling with its tyres.

   That meant Raikkonen was still within range of Button when McLaren
   tried - and failed in - a clever tactical ploy in an attempt to beat
   Barrichello.

   All things being equal, though, it is Ferrari and McLaren who will be
   expected to battle for the win.

   Barrichello is on a hat-trick after two wins in a row, and the
   Brazilian's confidence will be sky high.

   But as long as Michael Schumacher does not repeat the catalogue of
   errors he made in China - and indeed in Japan last year - he must be
   favourite at a track he adores.

   Arsenal name new ground

   Arsenal secure stadium cash

   Arsenal have signed a £100m deal with Emirates Airlines, which will see
   their new 60,000-seater ground at Ashburton Grove named the Emirates
   Stadium.

   The deal also sees Emirates become the Gunners' shirt sponsor for eight
   years - starting in 2006-07.

   The stadium, which should open in the same season, will take on its new
   name for the next 15 years.

   "The sheer size of this deal is an amazing opportunity," said Arsenal
   managing director Keith Edelman.

   In a statement, the club added: "The combined value of both elements of
   the sponsorship is by far the biggest deal ever undertaken in English
   football."

   Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood said he had mixed feelings about the
   decision to name the stadium after a sponsor.

   Hill-Wood accepted that many traditional fans would have been happier
   to see the new stadium named in honour of an Arsenal legend.

   We are talking a huge sum of money for the sponsorship, and you have to
   recognise the club's massive financial investment in the stadium

   Paul Matz, secretary AISA

   "I would be one those supporters," he said. "I've been here a long
   time, a great many years and if we named the new stadium after Herbert
   Chapman or even Arsene Wenger it would roll off the tongue.

   "But things have changed in football and this is a wonderful offer we
   have received - the biggest ever in English football. We must move on."

   Paul Matz, secretary of the Arsenal Independent Supporters Association,
   agreed the deal was just too good to turn down.

   "Part of being an Arsenal supporter is appreciating the culture and
   tradition of the club," he said.

   "But we are talking a huge sum of money for the sponsorship, and you
   have to recognise the club's massive financial investment in the
   stadium.

   "I want to see Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Arsene Wenger stay at
   the club. They are on big wages and we all make judgements about how
   far we'd go to keep them - personally I think this is fair enough.

   "And from surveys we've done with the fans, the majority of them were
   prepared to sell the ground's naming rights too."

   But Mike Francis from the Arsenal fanzine The Gooner said: "It didn't
   really come as a surprise as we'd been kind of expecting it, but I was
   a bit annoyed and upset anyway.

   I think 'The White Elephant' would be more apt
   From Skibbad
   Have your say on 606

   "My initial feeling about Emirates are who the hell are they and what
   have they got to do with Arsenal? Maybe someone like Nike would have
   been better.

   "I was hoping it was an easy name to drop so we wouldn't have to use it
   but it doesn't appear to be that way.

   "It's difficult to tell what the fans will call it as it's not built
   yet but I have a feeling we'll end up calling it Highbury still. But
   I'm a bit of traditionalist really.

   "The money doesn't really soften the blow. I'm afraid £100m doesn't
   sound a lot when you consider it includes a shirt sponsorship as well."

   In February, Arsenal finally secured the £357m needed to build the new
   stadium.

   The Gunners' new home will be built by Sir Robert McAlpine under a
   fixed price contract, which also includes the construction of a new
   waste and recycling centre.

   Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, currently sponsors Chelsea's shirts
   but that deal expires at the end of the season.

   "This represents a win-win partnership for both Emirates and Arsenal,"
   said Emirates chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum.

   Arsenal's current club and shirt sponsorship deal with phone company 02
   expires at the end of the 2005-6 season.

   Butt delights in maiden century

   Butt fought cramps to complete his highest international score

   Photos from Calcutta
   Match report

   Opening batsman Salman Butt described his maiden international century,
   which was key to Pakistan's victory over India, as a "gift from God".

   "I couldn't have asked for anything else," said Butt, who was forced to
   retire hurt with cramps but returned to complete an unbeaten 108.

   "The physio was cross with me because I didn't eat anything so I said I
   would not do that again.

   "All my seniors told me to bat through so that's what I concentrated
   on."

   Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq paid tribute to Butt and Shoaib Malik,
   whose century partnership set the visitors on course.

   There was a bit of dew but that was expected

   Sourav Ganguly

   And he also had praise for the bowlers who hauled India back to 292-6.

   "Nowadays every total is chaseable," said Inzamam after the six-wicket
   win.

   "This was a big total but the boys were confident, Shahid Afridi and
   Abdur Razzaq bowled well in the middle and the fielders did well on a
   big ground."

   His counterpart Sourav Ganguly was down to earth after India's fourth
   straight defeat to their arch-rivals, saying: "They are obviously
   playing better than us."

   India lost with an over to spare despite posting a venue-record 292-6
   at Calcutta's Eden Gardens.

   "It was a big score but we never looked like winning - their batting
   was superior," said Ganguly.

   "There was a bit of dew but that was expected."

   USA battle to keep Sydney golds

   Michael Johnson (centre) and his Sydney relay team-mates
   The 4x400m gold was the last of Johnson's (centre) career

   A recommendation for the United States' 4x400m team from the 2000
   Olympics to lose their gold medals is being challenged by the US
   Olympic Committee.

   The IAAF advised that the team should lose their medals because of a
   doping scandal involving Jerome Young.

   Only the International Olympic Committee can remove the medals and it
   will wait for the recommendations of the Court of Arbitration for
   Sport.

   The US Olympic Committee is contesting that only Young lose his medal.

   The USOC and five team members - Johnson, twins Alvin and Calvin
   Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew and Jerome Taylor - have filed an appeal
   with CAS in Lausanne, Switzerland.

   Young is not covered by the appeal.

   The appeal is directed against the IAAF and the IOC.

   Young tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in 1999, but was
   exonerated by a US appeals panel in July 2000, avoiding a two-year ban.

   If CAS upholds the decision of the IAAF, then of course the medals will
   be removed

   Jacques Rogge
   IOC president

   He ran in the opening and semi-final rounds of the 2000 Olympics in
   Sydney, but not in the final.

   Johnson ran the anchor leg in the final for the fifth and last Olympic
   gold medal of his career.

   All six members of the relay squad received gold medals.

   US Track & Field never gave the IAAF specifics about the Young case,
   citing confidentiality rules in place at the time. Young's name became
   public only last year.

   The IAAF ruled in July that the entire team should lose their medals
   because Jones should have been ineligible to compete.

   The IOC put off a decision in August pending resolution of all appeals.

   "If CAS upholds the decision of the IAAF, then of course the medals
   will be removed," IOC president Jacques Rogge said.

   If the US team loses its case, Nigeria will be upgraded to gold,
   Jamaica to silver and the Bahamas to bronze.

   Young, the world 400m champion in 2003, tested positive for the
   endurance-boosting drug EPO in July at a meeting in Paris.

   He faces a possible lifetime ban if found guilty of the second doping
   offense.

   The case is being handled by the US Anti-Doping Agency.

   Both Harrison brothers have also been banned for doping.

   Broadhurst retains share of lead

   Paul Broadhurst

   GB&Ire unless stated
   -13 P Broadhurst, D Fichardt (SA)
   -12 I Giner (Spa), G McDowell, B Rumford (Aus), R Sterne (SA)
   -11 J Edfors (Swe), A Hansen (Den), R Jacquelin (Fra), MA Jimenez
   (Spa), T Price (Aus)

   Clubhouse scores

   England's Paul Broadhurst birdied the 16th and 17th holes to join
   Darren Fichardt on 13 under and reclaim a share of the lead at the
   Madrid Open.

   The duo will take a one-shot lead into the final day at Club de Campo.

   After just one bogey in his first two rounds, the 39-year-old
   Broadhurst struggled until his two late birdies.

   There would have been a three-way tie for the lead if Sweden's Johan
   Edfors had not unluckily lost his ball after driving into the crowd at
   the last.

   The controversial incident could prove extremely costly as Edfors needs
   to finish first or second to avoid losing his tour card.

   Having reached the last on 13 under par and in a tie for first, the
   29-year-old hooked his drive into the trees.

   I would have paid a lot for that ball

   Johan Edfors

   When his ball could not be found playing partners Graeme McDowell of
   Northern Ireland and Denmark's Anders Hansen insisted that it must have
   been picked up by a spectator.

   But, despite appeals to the crowd in English and Spanish, referee Andy
   McFee ruled that, with no television evidence showing the ball at rest
   and nobody saying they had seen it being lifted, he could not give
   Edfors the benefit of the doubt.

   "I can't assume it - I need hard evidence," said McFee. "It's not the
   first time it's happened and it probably won't be the last, but nobody
   has an idea where it finished and so I have to declare it a lost ball."

   Edfors, the winner of last year's Challenge Tour, returned to the tee,
   double-bogeyed the hole and dropped to joint seventh place with a 69.

   He will resume on 11 under, two behind Broadhurst and South Africa's
   Fichardt.

   I feel pretty sick for (Edfors), but he is good enough to come back and
   do the business

   Graeme McDowell

   A stunned Edfors said: "It was not a nice way to finish. It's
   impossible to lose your ball there and it's quite expensive. I would
   have paid a lot for that ball."

   Broadhurst, round in 68, said: "It's career-threatening and there ought
   to be some allowance made for it. It keeps happening every week -
   somebody picking up a ball and stuffing it in their pocket.

   "It's not on really, especially when you're leading. I hope he keeps
   his card, but he is going to be absolutely devastated. Hopefully it's
   not going to affect him tomorrow."

   McDowell, who is just a shot off the lead on 12 under, added: "I feel
   pretty sick for him. It's one of these freak things - somebody has got
   that ball - but he is good enough to come back and do the business."

   Two more players embroiled in the race for cards for next year, Spain's
   Ivo Giner and South African Richard Sterne, were also in the group a
   stroke off the lead.

   Like Edfors, Giner needs to finish at least second but a top-20 finish
   could seal Sterne's card.

   England's Jamie Spence was also looking well-placed to keep his playing
   privileges after a 69 left him six strokes off the lead but comfortably
   placed to move to safety on Sunday.

   Celtic boss hopeful of progress

   MARTIN O'NEILL'S VIEW

   Martin O'Neill

   Celtic 1-0 Shakhtar Donetsk

   Celtic boss Martin O'Neill believes they still have a fighting chance
   in Europe after their 1-0 win over nine-man Shakhtar Donetsk.

   Alan Thompson's 25th minute goal gave the Scottish side their first
   Champions League victory of the season.

   The win gives them a chance of third spot in Group F, which brings the
   consolation of a Uefa Cup place.

   The Bhoys manager said: "We're back in it and we're going to do our
   utmost to go through."

   O'Neill added: "Regardless of the aggregate score tonight, we've given
   ourselves a chance.

   "We have nothing to lose."

   Donetsk's 3-0 defeat of Celtic in the Ukraine had left O'Neill's side
   bottom of Group F with no points.

   I honestly think we will finish third- we will get beaten by Barcelona,
   while AC Milan at home is a game we can win and I think we will

   Have your say on Fans' Forum

   But the Irishman feels that the narrow victory at Parkhead has given
   his side a chance of extending their stay in Europe beyond Christmas.

   The anxious 1-0 win leaves the Scottish champions on three points,
   alongside Shakhtar but still six points adrift of group leaders
   Barcelona and AC Milan.

   Celtic's final two games are against the Spanish and Italian giants.

   Celtic 1-0 Shakhtar Donetsk

   O'Neill continued: "It was our fourth game in nine days and I thought
   it took its toll against a very good Shakhtar Donetsk team.

   "With Barcelona scoring a late goal against Milan that puts them both
   on nine points so they only need one more."

   But despite this O'Neill is refusing to give up on the Champions League
   knockout stages - even though he admits the Uefa Cup remains his team's
   most realistic hope.

   "We've opened our account and my own view would be why not?

   "I do believe we are still in the Champions League.

   "We go to Barcelona with absolutely nothing to lose and if we don't do
   it there then we have one more shot at it against AC Milan.

   He added: "You would think that six points would give you a fighting
   chance of being in the Uefa Cup."

   Poutiainen takes second Aspen win

   Tanja Poutiainen

   World Cup standings

   Finland's Tanja Poutiainen won her second World Cup race in three days
   at Aspen with victory in the slalom.

   Poutiainen, who won Friday's giant slalom and was third behind Janica
   Kostelic in Saturday's slalom, beat Italy's Manuela Moelgg by 1.21
   seconds.

   American Kristina Koznick was third, 1.37 seconds behind Poutiainen.

   Kostelic saw her hopes of a slalom double on her comeback after a year
   out of skiing fade when she slid off the course early in the second
   run.

   With visibility low and the course choppy, 21 racers did not finish -
   including Sweden's Anja Paerson, who was second in Friday's giant
   slalom and Saturday's slalom.

   The reigning World Cup slalom and giant slalom champion went too fast
   near the top of the course and missed a turn.

   Poutiainen now leads the overall World Cup standings on 340 points,
   with Paerson second on 260 and Kostelic third on 192.

   Eto'o targeted by racist chants

   Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o is challenged by Getafe's Vivar Dorado

   Uefa to probe Real Madrid racism
   Racism fight tackles new frontier

   Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o was the victim of alleged racist abuse
   in his side's 2-1 win over Getafe in Madrid.

   A small group of home supporters appeared to direct monkey chants at
   the African player of the year every time he touched the ball.

   Eto'o refused to comment but Getafe striker Gica Craioveanu said: "I
   don't agree with this behaviour. I wouldn't have liked to have been in
   his shoes."

   England's black players were subjected to verbal abuse in a game with
   Spain.

   Fifa has launched an investigation into those recent events, while Uefa
   is looking into apparent abuse of Bayer Leverkusen's players in a
   Champions League game against Real Madrid.

   Both incidents occurred in Real's Bernabeu stadium.

   Spain target American doubles act

   Mike (left) and Bob Bryan win the Masters Cup
   Mike (left) and Bob Bryan have been in good form this year

   Spain are focusing on the threat posed by US doubles duo Mike and Bob
   Bryan ahead of the season-ending Davis Cup final, starting in Seville
   on Friday.

   America have world number two Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish on their
   singles team for the clay-court showdown.

   But Spain coach Juan Avendano told Marca newspaper that the Bryan
   brothers would be the hardest obstacle.

   "For me, the doubles will be the most difficult rubber - on paper they
   are more experienced as a duo," he said.

   The Bryans have won all three of their 2004 cup doubles encounters
   without losing a set, while Spain's Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo have
   won one and lost two of their ties.

   Have Your Say
   Who will win the Davis Cup?

   Avendano denied that his team had given up on overturning the
   big-serving Roddick.

   "It is true that we have more possibilities against Fish but we have to
   think about winning against Roddick and in the doubles," said Jose
   Perlas, another of the national coaches.

   "We think we can make the five points."

   The Spanish team will hope to gain advantage from the slow courts and
   the support of a 23,000-strong capacity crowd.

   Teams register for 2005 F1 season

   Red Bull have taken over the Jaguar team
   Red Bull bought the Jaguar team in November

   Ten teams have entered the 2005 Formula One world championship, the
   same number as competed in 2004.

   The list issued by the FIA, the sport's governing body, included
   "Jaguar Racing" whose name will change to Red Bull after their recent
   sale.

   Minardi and Jordan, whose future was in doubt after Ford's decision to
   sell its engine supplier, are also included.

   None of the trio have entered drivers but have until 3 March to do so.
   The new season begins on 6 March.

   An FIA spokesman said the reference to Jaguar was merely procedural and
   that a name change to Red Bull had been applied for.

   Price's US Tour hopes get boost

   Phillip Price
   Price represented Europe at the 2002 Ryder Cup

   Phillip Price's hopes of securing a PGA Tour card have been boosted
   after he finished the first round of the qualifying tournament in
   second place.

   Price, who has played in Europe for 14 years, is tied for second with
   three players, one behind leader Scott Gump.

   The Welshman ended with a 67 after a rash of birdies on the back nine.

   The top 30 players after the sixth round on Monday will earn PGA Tour
   exemptions, with the next 50 claiming full exemptions to the Nationwide
   Tour.

   Other British players in contention include Bristol's John Morgan,
   whose round of 71 left him in joint 51st, while Brian Davis and Greg
   Owen are tied for 84th.

   England's Sean Whiffin, Canada-based Scot Alan McLean and Ireland's
   Richie Coughlan are one stroke further back

   Gump was keen not to get too carried away with his early lead,
   insisting there was a long way to go.

   "You just want to get in a rhythm," he said.

   "Even with the bad shots, you want to get in a rhythm. In 108 holes,
   everybody's going to make some bogeys, and probably throw some doubles
   in there.

   "Hopefully there will be some birdies, too."

   Paris hosted the 2003 Worlds

   Berlin has been named as host of the 2009 World Athletics
   Championships.

   The German capital beat bids by European rivals Valencia and Split in a
   vote at a meeting of the International Association of Athletics
   Federations.

   Berlin had previously missed out in its attempt to host the 2005
   Worlds, which were given to Helsinki in Finland.

   Paris staged the last event in 2003 and is now bidding against London
   and other cities for the right to put on the 2012 Olympic Games.

   Champions League round-up

   Nelson Valdez

   Final Group standings

   Werder Bremen beat Valencia 2-0 in Group G to go through to the last 16
   - but the game was marred by ugly scenes.

   Paraguayan Nelson Valdez scored two goals in the last seven minutes
   after coming on as a substitute for Bremen.

   But Valencia's Miguel Angel Angulo was red-carded for chopping down
   Valdez in the final minute and then spat in the direction of the Bremen
   striker.

   Inter Milan beat Anderlecht 3-0 - with Julio Ricardo Cruz and Obafemi
   Martins getting the goals - to top the group.

   PSV Eindhoven had to settle for second place behind Arsenal in Group E
   after losing 4-1 away at Panathinaikos.

   Markus Munch scored twice for the Greeks - who now go into the Uefa Cup
   - with Dimitris Papadopoulos and Lucian Sanmartean getting a goal
   apiece.

   DaMarcus Beasley had scored an equaliser for PSV in the 37th minute.

   Arsenal 5-1 Rosenborg

   Arsenal beat Rosenborg 5-1 to top the group, with Jose Antonio Reyes,
   Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Robert Pires and Robin van Persie getting
   their goals.

   AC Milan finished as winners of Group F after holding Celtic to a
   goalless draw at Celtic Park.

   Celtic 0-0 AC Milan

   Brazilian defender Serginho came closest to breaking the deadlock when
   he thumped a shot against the woodwork for the Serie A outfit.

   Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk caused a major shock by beating
   Barcelona 2-0 to qualify for the Uefa Cup.

   Nigerian striker Julius Aghahowa scored both the goals against a
   largely second-string Barca side.

   Sergey Semak scored a hat-trick for CSKA Moscow as they beat Paris St
   Germain 3-1, but it was not enough for the Russian side to go through.

   Porto 2-1 Chelsea

   Porto's dramatic 2-1 win over Chelsea meant they finished behind the
   west-London side in Group H.

   Fabrice Pancrate equalised for PSG in the first half and shortly after
   the break CSKA were down to 10 men after Deividas Semberas was sent
   off.

   But Semak punished sloppy defending with two more goals after the
   break.

Officials Show They Will Enforce Contact Rule

League's Instructions Taken Seriously in Season Opener

   By Mark Maske
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, September 10, 2004; 6:15 PM

   Yes, officials will do as instructed this season and crack down on
   clutching-and-grabbing tactics by defensive backs.

   That was the early message from the New England Patriots' 27-24 triumph
   over the Indianapolis Colts in the NFL's nationally televised
   season-opening game Thursday night.

   It was an immediate showcase for the offseason directive by the
   league's competition committee to game officials to strictly enforce
   the rule prohibiting a defensive back from using physical contact to
   alter a receiver's pass route more than five yards downfield. Colts
   President Bill Polian is a member of the committee and was irate after
   Patriots defenders got away with some holding infractions that went
   uncalled in the final stages of last season's AFC title game won by New
   England, 24-14.

   The officials called six infractions -- four for holding, one for
   illegal contact and one for pass interference -- against defenders in
   the second half Thursday, four of them against the Patriots, after a
   first half in which no such penalties were called.

   The Patriots were known for their aggressive pass-defending methods
   while winning two of the past three Super Bowls, so they went into
   Thursday's game expecting to have several calls made against them. Two
   of the penalties they received Thursday fell somewhere between
   borderline and wrong. Safety Rodney Harrison was called for holding
   Colts tight end Marcus Pollard on a third-quarter play on which
   Indianapolis appeared to be attempting to run an illegal pick play and
   Pollard slammed into Harrison. But the pass was completed to the other
   side of the field and the Colts declined the penalty.

   In the fourth quarter, New England cornerback Tyrone Poole was called
   for illegal contact on a play on which he, at most, lightly brushed
   Marvin Harrison and didn't affect the wide receiver's route, then got
   shoved by Harrison on the receiver's break. The call followed an
   incomplete pass and gave the Colts five yards and a first down.

   The competition committee was looking to open up the game after passing
   yards per contest in the NFL fell to an 11-year low last season. The
   early returns were that the committee will accomplish its task.
   Quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning combined for 591 passing
   yards Thursday and the two clubs totaled 848 yards of total offense.

   The Patriots left newly acquired tailback Corey Dillon on the sideline
   and threw eight straight passes on their opening drive on their way to
   an Adam Vinatieri field goal. Brady finished the night with 335 passing
   yards. He threw his first interception at home since the 2002 season --
   after 288 throws without one -- but passed for three touchdowns and had
   seven completions of at least 19 yards each. Manning was intercepted by
   Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi on Indianapolis's first drive --
   Manning's 16th interception in six career starts in Foxboro, Mass., in
   which he is winless -- but threw for 256 yards and a touchdown. Manning
   had the Colts in position for a game-tying field goal in the final
   seconds, but Mike Vanderjagt sent a 48-yard attempt wide right to end
   his streak of 42 straight successful field goal tries. He was 37 for 37
   last season and last missed on Dec. 8, 2002. . . .

   The Patriots won their 16th straight game, two away from the unofficial
   NFL record. They won their 13th consecutive regular season game, four
   from the record that's official since the league counts only regular
   season games in its listing of the longest winning streaks. Dillon had
   a nice debut by running for 86 yards on 15 carries. But not all was
   promising for the Patriots. Cornerback Ty Law limped around on what
   appeared to be a right hamstring injury and was in and out of the
   lineup. Keith Traylor looked like a less-than-capable replacement for
   departed nose tackle Ted Washington as the New England defense was
   shredded for 202 rushing yards by the Colts, including 142 by Edgerrin
   James. . . .

   Manning surpassed 25,000 career passing yards in his 97th regular
   season game. He reached that milestone in the second-fewest games in
   league history. Dan Marino got there in 92 games. . . .

   Colts Coach Tony Dungy didn't make an instant-replay challenge to a
   call all of last season but made one Thursday night on one of the two
   fumbles lost by James, contending that the tailback was down by contact
   before the ball came free. Dungy lost the challenge. . . . Dungy
   confirmed to reporters after the game that his wife Lauren was
   hospitalized in Indianapolis but said she was fine and would not
   comment on a report that she had a collapsed lung.

   Brady Deal Reworked

   The Patriots got under the $80.582 million salary cap by this week's
   deadline (all 53 players on the active roster, the eight on the
   practice squad and those on the injured reserve list count against the
   cap during the season, while only the top 51 players count during the
   offseason) by reworking Brady's contract.

   The team guaranteed the quarterback's $5.5 million salary, enabling it
   to prorate that total over the three seasons left on Brady's contract
   for cap accounting purposes. That cleared more than $3 million in cap
   space for the Patriots, who apparently had to trim about $1 million to
   be in cap compliance.

   The Patriots did nothing with the cumbersome contract of Law, who
   counts $10.2 million against this season's cap, and avoided another
   last-minute roster move like last year, when Coach Bill Belichick
   released Lawyer Milloy just before the season after the safety refused
   to accept the team's proposed pay cut.

   It's the second straight season that the Patriots have restructured
   Brady's contract and it sets the stage for negotiating a completely new
   deal with the quarterback, who now counts about $10 million against the
   2005 salary cap and about $12 million against the '06 cap. . . .

   The Patriots had Rohan Davey as their No. 2 quarterback Thursday, with
   Jim Miller as their emergency third-stringer.

   Gannon Also Restructures

   Rich Gannon, who enters the season as the Oakland Raiders' starting
   quarterback just ahead of newcomer Kerry Collins, also restructured his
   contract in recent days, agreeing to convert $2.5 million of his $7
   million salary into unlikely-to-be-earned incentives that don't count
   against the salary cap. . . .

   Raiders Coach Norv Turner is promising to announce his starting
   offensive line today. Robert Gallery, the second overall selection in
   the draft, has gotten some practice time at right tackle this week
   after playing during the preseason at left guard as well as his natural
   position, left tackle. The Raiders have Barry Simms at left tackle,
   Frank Middleton at left guard and Langston Walker at right tackle, and
   Gallery could take any of those spots or perhaps even begin the season
   on the bench.

   The only position that appears set on the Raiders' line is right guard,
   where Ron Stone is penciled in as the starter. Turner previously
   indicated that Adam Treu would open the season as the starter at
   center, but perhaps could make a last-minute switch to rookie Jake
   Grove.

   Anderson To Join Titans, But Not Yet

   Place kicker Gary Anderson, the NFL's career scoring leader, has agreed
   to join the Tennessee Titans but probably won't do so until next week.
   He likely will replace Joe Nedney for a second straight season. The
   Titans placed Nedney on the injured reserve list after he hurt his
   hamstring Tuesday.

   Barring a last-minute switch, punter Craig Hentrich will handle the
   field-goal duties during Saturday's rescheduled opening game at Miami.
   Hentrich kicked three field goals in last season's opener after Nedney
   got hurt, and went one for two on long field goal tries after Anderson
   joined the team. Once Anderson arrives, Hentrich will go back to
   punting and will handle kickoffs and lengthy field goals. To lighten
   Hentrich's workload a bit Saturday, the Titans plan to sign kicker
   Aaron Elling, just cut by Minnesota, to do kickoffs. The team also
   brought in kickers Tim Duncan and Matt Bryant for workouts, although
   Bryant was unable to kick because of a hamstring injury. . . .

   The Dolphins are doing their best to take a positive outlook into the
   season after their turbulent offseason, training camp and exhibition
   season.

   "It has been a crazy offseason,'' recently signed defensive end Chidi
   Ahanotu told reporters Thursday. "But in this day and age, anything can
   happen. Any team can be a champion.'' . . .

   Quarterback Tim Couch and his agent, Tom Condon, apparently are
   contemplating filing a grievance against the Green Bay Packers. Couch
   was released by the Packers and now is having his sore right shoulder
   and arm checked out. NFL rules prohibit an injured player from being
   released without a financial settlement. Couch received a $625,000
   signing bonus from Green Bay but won't collect his $625,000 salary for
   the season from the team. . . .

   The St. Louis Rams placed Zack Bronson on the injured reserve list and
   re-signed safety Justin Lucas, just cut by the club Sunday. The Rams
   signed Bronson on Sunday but he hurt his ankle in practice Wednesday. .
   . .

   Josh Reed is slated to start for Buffalo at the wide receiver spot
   opposite Eric Moulds, with first-round draft choice Lee Evans serving
   as the Bills' No. 3 wideout. . . .

   Arizona has placed safety Dexter Jackson on IR because of a back injury
   and is contemplating reaching an injury settlement with the former
   Super Bowl most valuable player for Tampa Bay and releasing him. . . .

   The Vikings face Dallas on Sunday, and Minnesota wideout Randy Moss
   always has thrived against the Cowboys after once saying that he would
   punish them forever for passing him over in the 1998 draft. In four
   career games against the Cowboys, Moss has 21 catches for 525 yards and
   eight touchdowns. And that was without the aid of stricter enforcement
   of the illegal-contact rule.

   Networks Kept In L.A. Loop

   The NFL is making a strong push to put a team back in Los Angeles at
   the same time it is preparing to negotiate a new set of network
   television contracts, and that probably isn't a coincidence. CBS Sports
   President Sean McManus said this week that his network isn't directly
   involved in the league's discussions with representatives for the Los
   Angeles market but is kept updated by the NFL as a "courtesy.''

   Said McManus: "They'd like to have a team in Los Angeles. They
   understand the importance of having the second-largest media market in
   the country. Having said that, it's not as if the league has suffered
   dramatically since losing the L.A. team. The television ratings have
   been very consistent. I think the television packages have been pretty
   successful, and there's still an awful lot of interest across the
   country in NFL football. So as much as they'd like it, I think they're
   not going to go in and do anything quickly or make a mistake.''

   Panthers Rework Muhammad's Contract

   The Carolina Panthers saved $1.87 million in salary cap space by
   restructuring the contract of wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad. The
   Panthers added a season to Muhammad's deal, which had been set to
   expire following this season, and converted $3.74 million of his salary
   into a new signing bonus, which then could be prorated over the next
   two seasons for cap accounting purposes. That lowered Muhammad's cap
   figure for this season from $6.478 million to $4.6 million. But, even
   with the additional year on his contract, he almost certainly will be
   released before next season, when he would receive a $10 million roster
   bonus and count $12.535 million against the salary cap. . . .

   The Packers had been hopeful that cornerback Mike McKenzie would end
   his holdout and show up for work Wednesday. He didn't. And now that it
   appears that McKenzie's contract dispute will linger into the season,
   the Packers will have to make some adjustments for Monday night's
   opener at Carolina. Green Bay rarely flip-flopped its cornerbacks last
   season, usually leaving McKenzie on one side of the field and Al Harris
   on the other; each covered whichever receiver lined up on his side of
   the field, and the Packers didn't fret too much about the matchups.

   But Green Bay probably doesn't want to allow McKenzie's replacement,
   Michael Hawthorne, to get caught covering Panthers star wideout Steve
   Smith too often Monday, so Harris perhaps will follow Smith to
   whichever side of the field he lines up on. That would leave Hawthorne
   usually covering Muhammad. Hawthorne got the starting nod over
   first-round draft choice Ahmad Carroll, who was selected as a
   prospective replacement for McKenzie but now is slated to be the third
   cornerback Monday. . . .

   The New York Giants certainly look like the weak link in a bolstered
   NFC East as the season gets under way. "If they win more than six
   games,'' just-retired Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said this
   week, "Tom Coughlin deserves coach of the year.''

   Fellow CBS analyst Boomer Esiason said the Giants' record would be
   "definitely south of .500,'' and predicated that top overall draft
   selection Eli Manning would take over for veteran Kurt Warner as the
   team's starting quarterback "before the halfway point in the season.''

   Even former Giants quarterback Phil Simms has modest goals for the
   club's season. "It'll be deemed a success if they get it organized and
   get it together late in the year,'' Simms said. . . .

   Jason Whittle, just acquired in a trade with Tampa Bay last week, is
   slated to be the Giants’ starting left guard on Sunday at Philadelphia.
   Kevin Lewis is to start at middle linebacker ahead of Nick Greisen, who
   was the designated replacement for Michael Barrow when the veteran was
   released but didn’t regain the job after hurting his hamstring in the
   preseason opener. The Giants plan to make a game-time decision Sunday
   about whether starting cornerback Will Allen, hindered by a sprained
   knee, will play against the Eagles. Allen practiced today. . . .

   Rookie Madieu Williams, a second-round draft pick from the University
   of Maryland, could start for the Cincinnati Bengals at cornerback on
   Sunday against the New York Jets in place of Deltha O'Neal, who
   continues to be bothered by an ankle injury suffered in the first
   preseason game. . . .

   Tailback Lee Suggs is unlikely to play for Cleveland against Baltimore
   on Sunday because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He hasn't practiced
   yet this week. . . .

   Dick Jauron, fired as Chicago's head coach after last season, faces the
   Bears on Sunday as Detroit's new defensive coordinator. . . .

   Wide receiver Kevin Dyson passed his physical for Tennessee this week
   and worked out for the Titans, but wasn't immediately signed. The
   Titans still might sign Dyson, released by San Diego, after the opening
   game, when his salary for the season wouldn't be guaranteed. Dyson's
   salary for the season becomes guaranteed if he's on a team's
   season-opening roster because he's a vested veteran. . . .

   Chargers center Jason Ball apparently will continue his holdout into
   the season. . . .

   Wide receiver Torry Holt participated in the Rams' practice on Thursday
   after being plagued by back spasms this week. . . .

   The Cowboys signed rookie running back Ran Carthon to their practice
   squad this week. He is the son of the team's offensive coordinator and
   running backs coach, Maurice Carthon.

   Buffalo defensive tackle Sam Adams missed some of today’s practice
   because of a sprained toe but probably will play in the Bills’ opener.
   . . .

   Bears middle linebacker Brian Urlacher practiced today and the team
   seems increasingly confident he is recovered from the severe hamstring
   pull that he suffered at the outset of training camp.

Talk the Talk

   Saturday, November 6, 2004; Page D11

   Ever feel like listening to one football coach is the same as listening
   to another? Or that coaches say the same thing from day to day, week to
   week, month to month and year to year? Well, that's because it is, and
   they do. The sports world, of course, is the foremost haven for
   clichés, and there might be no better place to unearth them than
   through college football coaches, who -- because they are paranoid
   about their kids being criticized, about their own job security, about
   what an opponent might read into an honest assessment, about life in
   general -- seem to drop worn-out, over-used platitudes at every
   opportunity.

   Here, then, is a brief sample of things coaches actually said, taken
   from interviews over the last two weeks. Remember, take them one cliche
   at a time, because there's a lot on the line, and we need someone to
   step up to the task.

                           ^_____On the Spot^_____

   It seems absurd that a man could spend 55 years at a university, 39 as
   a head coach, become synonymous with the place -- and have his
   employment status questioned. Yet that's what's happening to Joe
   Paterno of Penn State. The numbers always used to stack up in his
   favor: 31 bowl appearances with 20 of them victories, 341 wins, 69
   all-Americans.

   But the numbers now outline Penn State's slide to mediocrity just as
   starkly: Paterno is 24-31 since 2000, with five wins in the last 21
   games. He has one Big Ten victory in his last 13 conference games, four
   losing seasons in the last five and just two wins this season --
   against Akron (4-4) and Central Florida (0-8). During the current
   five-game losing streak, the Nittany Lions have scored just three
   touchdowns.

   So it is easy to make jokes about Unhappy Valley, but this is now a
   major problem. Paterno, 78, wants to depart from a successful program.
   To that end, the school gave him a four-year contract extension so he
   could reassure recruits, "I'll be here." But the chances that he will
   leave a rebuilding project for his successor, whoever that may be, are
   becoming increasingly likely.

   Paterno was asked this week if he thought he deserved to return next
   season.

   "I don't appreciate that question, to be honest," he said.

   It's not going away.

                         ^_____Lowly Showdown^_____

   And the site for the big showdown in the Big 12 is . . . Ames, Iowa?
   Iowa State (4-4, 2-3 Big 12) hosts Nebraska (5-3, 3-2) today in a
   battle between the two (ahem) best teams in the Big 12 North. If
   Nebraska wins, it would have the six victories necessary to qualify for
   a bowl game and be the clear favorite in the North. But the Cornhuskers
   finish the regular season with games against Oklahoma and Colorado --
   and could lose both. That could put the Huskers in the Big 12 title
   game at 6-5. But wait. Teams that play 12 games must win seven to
   qualify for a bowl. Lose it, and the Big 12 would have to appeal to the
   NCAA to get the Huskers a bid. Ain't college football grand?

                       ^_____Killing Him Softly^_____

   We keep trying to deny that there's some sort of East Coast media bias
   when it comes to college football (and look who's atop the polls, by
   the way), but then something like this happens: Washington fires Coach
   Keith Gilbertson after a 1-7 start -- 0-5 in the Pac-10 -- and there's
   barely a whisper along the I-95 corridor. Well, you say, Washington's
   no Florida, where Ron Zook's firing was treated as a national incident.
   Check out the stats, though: The Huskies, who shared the 1991 national
   title, hadn't had a losing season in 28 years. New athletic director
   Todd Turner, late of Vanderbilt, has pledged to make U-Dub a football
   power again.

                      ^_____Justice, Bowden-Style^_____

   Bobby Bowden sure has some tough dadgum decisions to make, don't he?
   His dadgum leading receiver, Craphonso Thorpe, decided that going to
   class was optional. (Two questions: (1) Isn't that a reasonable
   assumption at Florida State? (2) Is there anyone else in the world
   named Craphonso?) So Bowden suspended Thorpe for today's game. Now,
   we're sure he didn't look at the schedule before he made that call.
   Today's opponent, Duke, is a dadgum dangerous team, dontchaknow? New
   starting quarterback Chris Rix -- he of the 37 previous starts -- will
   have to find other receivers against the rugged Blue Devils defense
   (433 yards allowed per game).

                     ^_____Climbing Out of the Pit^_____

   Remember when Pittsburgh needed overtime to beat Furman? Yes, the
   mighty Purple Paladins reside in Division I-AA. Then, the Panthers
   needed a late score to beat Temple. Yes, the mighty Owls should reside
   in Division I-AA. Well, if Pitt can win at Syracuse today, then its
   home game on Nov. 25 against West Virginia could be for both the Big
   East championship and the Bowl Championship Series berth that goes with
   it. Despite an offense that ranks 81st nationally and a defense that
   ranks 70th, the Panthers have only one conference loss, to Connecticut,
   and they beat Boston College. So . . . insert
   weekly-gratuitous-shot-at-the-Big East here.

                        ^___ What Will Utes Get? ^___

   If Utah finishes the regular season undefeated, what postseason fate
   does it deserve?
   (_) A spot in the national championship game.
   (_) A BCS bowl berth, but not in the title game.
   (_) The Liberty Bowl, as the Mountain West champion.

   What they said: "All you can do is try to win every game you've got and
   take it one game at a time and try to win it. That's all you can do."

   "We just got to stick together and, like I said, take this thing one
   game at a time."

   Who said it: Florida State's Bobby Bowden and Miami's Larry Coker,
   respectively

   Why they said it: Because someone had the temerity to ask about the
   season as a whole, or an upcoming opponent beyond this week.

   What they meant: "I don't want to talk about the rest of the schedule
   or other teams. In fact, I don't want to answer your question. So I'll
   fall back on something that was programmed into my brain as a young
   coach to avoid talking about such things."

   Cliché meter: 10. What more could you want? "One game at a time" has
   the classic eloquence of Sinatra, the reliability of Maytag, the
   omnipresence of the Olsen twins.

   What they said: "He is a guy who goes out and does his job to the best
   of his ability and is a wonderful football player for our football
   team."

   "We, as a football team, need to find a way to win a football game, if
   that's possible."

   Who said it: Georgia Tech's Chan Gailey and Purdue's Joe Tiller,
   respectively

   Why they said it: Because football coaches, above all else, love
   football. They live their lives at the football stadium preparing for
   football practice with fine young football players preparing to play
   the great game of football.

   What they meant: "Perhaps you forgot who you were talking to, or what
   we were talking about. We are not talking about basketball (which is
   for wusses) or baseball (again: wusses). We are talking about football,
   which is for men."

Uninspired Terps Come Out 'Flat'

   By Eric Prisbell
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Sunday, November 7, 2004; Page E15

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Nov. 6 -- Maryland had a similar experience here two
   years ago, when they lost by 35 and Terps Coach Ralph Friedgen blamed
   himself. He had practiced his players too hard all week.

   That was not the case Saturday. The blame for Maryland's 16-0 loss to
   Virginia rested with players, many of whom, Friedgen said, were "flat"
   and had "blank stares." The Terps (4-5, 2-4 ACC) have lost games this
   season because of offensive futility, turnovers or a late-game
   controversial pass interference call, but never in a passionless
   fashion, as Friedgen categorized Saturday's game.
   "It was like the walk of the zombies," Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen
   said. "Nobody was home. We were talking to them, trying to motivate
   them." (Joel Richardson -- The Washington Post)

                          ^_____From The Post^_____

   • U-Va. dominates on both sides of the ball, shutting out U-Md., 16-0.
   • Mike Wise: The Terps fail to secure a tiny margin of real estate at a
   crucial moment.
   • Led by Ahmad Brooks, the Cavaliers' defense comes up big.
   • Ralph Friedgen's players turn in an uninspired performance.

   Interviews with players from both sides and Friedgen painted a picture
   of some Maryland players who were emotionally stale yet perhaps still
   bad-mouthing their opponent late into the game. At least one Maryland
   player suggested that others needed to play with the same intensity he
   had displayed.

   "It was like the walk of the zombies," Friedgen said. "Nobody was home.
   We were talking to them, trying to motivate them. Nothing was
   registering."

   The question that resonated afterward among players: How can the team
   be uninspired against its most bitter rival? "I have to evaluate
   myself," Friedgen said. "If they can't get up for this game, I don't
   know what the hell is wrong with me."

   Added center Kyle Schmitt: "Yeah, it's tough to imagine, but this
   season has been a roller coaster. There's been a lot to deal with, not
   just physically but mentally. It wears on you. . . . There are a lot
   more tougher things going on in the world than getting up for a
   football game. But it's tough because we put everything we have into
   this for 12 months a year. Emotionally ready? I hope everyone was
   ready, but what can you say?"

   On Oct. 30, Maryland scored the most important win of the Friedgen era,
   beating then-No. 5 Florida State, 20-17. Maryland players had carried
   over the celebration a little longer than the coaching staff would have
   liked last week, but Friedgen felt they were prepared. He reduced
   contact in practice to heal players and kept alive the "We Believe"
   campaign that proved a motivating factor against the Seminoles.

   His message fell on deaf ears. "The next level isn't promised to me,"
   senior defensive lineman Henry Scott said. "I'm trying to play every
   game like it's my last. I think we need to get a couple more guys on
   that page and we'll be all right."

   Players from both teams exchanged barbs in the media throughout the
   week. Maryland players did not stop Saturday, even as they trailed late
   in the game, according to Virginia left guard Brian Barthelmes.

   "Maryland tries to make this more of a rivalry than it really is,"
   Barthelmes said. "In the fourth quarter, they were still talking junk.
   . . . As the other person, you've got to try and be mature and not let
   that get to you."

   Terrapins Notes: Ten Maryland players missed the game because of
   injuries, including senior kick returner-wide receiver Steve Suter. . .
   . Quarterback Joel Statham underwent X-rays on his left collarbone at
   halftime, but no fracture was found, Friedgen said.

Schumacher Notches 12th Win

   Associated Press
   Monday, August 16, 2004; Page D03

   Michael Schumacher won the Hungarian Grand Prix yesterday in Budapest,
   setting yet another record by becoming the first Formula One driver
   with 12 victories in a season.

   Schumacher, who has failed to win only once this season, took the lead
   on the first turn and never trailed. He can wrap up an unprecedented
   seventh drivers' title in two weeks at the Belgian Grand Prix in the
   most lopsided season in Formula One history.
   Despite feeling ill, Tony Stewart takes the checkered flag at the
   Sirius at the Glen for his second win of the year. (David Duprey -- AP)

   Teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second, giving Ferrari its sixth
   straight constructors' championship with five races left.

   Schumacher also became the first to win seven consecutive races in a
   season. Italy's Alberto Ascari won nine straight, but that was over two
   seasons (1952-53) and in a different era.

   "It's just keeps going, and I'm going to enjoy it as long as it does,"
   Schumacher said. Speaking of the constructors' title, he added: "It's
   the way we did it, so early, so dominant and so perfect. It's just
   outstanding."

   Schumacher won five straight to start the season. In Monaco, he was
   leading when he was taken out in a crash with Juan Pablo Montoya as the
   cars were running under the safety flag.

   Renault's Fernando Alonso, who won in Budapest last year, was third,
   44.5 seconds behind the winner, with fourth place going to
   Williams-BMW's Montoya. Jenson Button of BAR-Honda was fifth, followed
   by teammate Takuma Sato.

   Schumacher's list of major Formula One records is daunting: most
   victories in a season (12), most career victories (82), most series
   championships (six), most points (1,158) and most consecutive wins in a
   single season (seven).

   • NASCAR: Tony Stewart overcame an upset stomach and cramps in his legs
   to win at Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International.

   It was the second win for Stewart in the Sirius at the Glen, one of two
   road-course races each year on the NASCAR Nextel Cup circuit. He has
   three victories in that discipline.

   The 2002 series and Watkins Glen champion also got his second win of
   the season and the 19th of his career. He complained of feeling ill
   early in the race but decided to stay in the car as road-course ace
   Boris Said stood by to relieve him.

   The winner went back to his hauler as soon as he exited the track and
   was not immediately available to comment.

   Stewart, who started fourth after qualifying was canceled because of a
   wet track and the field was set by car-owner points, led 46 of 90 laps
   on the 11-turn serpentine layout. His Chevrolet beat that of
   road-course star Ron Fellows by 1.517 seconds.

   "We had to work hard, but I just didn't have enough left for Tony after
   that last caution," Fellows said. "They gave me everything I needed in
   a car, but I'm disappointed."

   Mark Martin finished third, followed by Casey Mears and Dale Earnhardt
   Jr.

   • IRL: Adrian Fernandez posted the first win of his Indy Racing League
   IndyCar Series career, holding off Buddy Rice to win the Belterra
   Casino Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta.

   Fernandez beat Rice by 0.0581 of a second. Dan Wheldon, Kosuke Matsuura
   and series points leader Tony Kanaan rounded out the top five.

   • CHAMP CAR: Bumped to 13th place coming out of the race's first turn,
   Sebastien Bourdais weaved his way through the field and passed Paul
   Tracy with 10 laps left to win the Grand Prix of Denver. Bourdais
   increased his Champ Car points lead to 56 over Newman-Haas teammate
   Bruno Junqueira.

On the Mound or Off, Ex-Cav Koshansky Just Wants to Play

   By Dan Steinberg
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Sunday, August 29, 2004; Page E07

   The scouts told Joe Koshansky he would be a first baseman, and he
   didn't care to disagree. It didn't matter that he finished his
   University of Virginia pitching career tied for the most starts and the
   most wins in school history, and it didn't matter that he wasn't an
   everyday position player until his junior season.

   Having listened in vain for his name throughout the 2003 Major League
   Baseball first-year player draft, Koshansky, 22, wasn't about to get
   picky.

   "They told me my future was going to be in hitting, but I really didn't
   worry about that," said the 2000 All-Met from Chantilly High. "I would
   have gone either way -- I just wanted to get picked up."

   After earning ACC player of the year honors as a senior, batting .302
   with a team-high 16 home runs and 67 RBI while amassing an 8-3 record
   on the mound, Koshansky got his wish. He was taken in the sixth round
   of this year's draft by the Colorado Rockies and told to pack his bags
   for Pasco, Wash., meriting an Internet search by Koshansky, who had
   never been farther west than New Mexico.

   Because of limited plate appearances in his first two years at Virginia
   -- only 60 at-bats -- Koshansky acknowledged he has room for
   improvement as a hitter. He said he is still compiling information on
   situations and counts, still struggling to limit his strikeouts and
   adjust to professional pitching.

   But despite a .239 average through Friday, Koshansky leads the less
   advanced Class A Tri-City Dust Devils with 12 home runs and 17 doubles.
   He said the ball seems to take off from his wooden bats as quickly as
   it did from his metal bats in college.

   His goal is to advance one level of minor league baseball a year, along
   the way finding time to complete his economics degree at Virginia. And
   just in case, Koshansky occasionally breaks out a two-seam fastball or
   a curveball during pregame warmups.

   "If we get in a blowout and they want me to throw an inning," he said,
   "I'd be more than happy to."

Rookie J. Jones, Cowboys Up and Running

   By Mark Maske
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Wednesday, December 8, 2004; Page D04

   NFL scouts and front-office executives were less than enamored of the
   top tailbacks available in the draft in April. The first didn't come
   off the board until the St. Louis Rams took Oregon State's Steven
   Jackson with the 24th overall choice. Virginia Tech's Kevin Jones
   plummeted to the Detroit Lions with the 30th selection. The Dallas
   Cowboys desperately needed a featured runner, yet traded out of the
   first round entirely and took Notre Dame's Julius Jones with the 11th
   pick of the second round, No. 43 overall.

   In each case, though, the early returns are promising. Jackson looks
   like a worthy successor to Marshall Faulk -- perhaps as soon as next
   season -- in St. Louis. With Faulk sidelined because of a knee problem,
   Jackson got 26 carries in Sunday's win over the San Francisco 49ers (13
   more than in any previous game this season) and ran for 119 yards.
   Cowboys' Julius Jones, hugged by Andre Gurode after scoring the winning
   touchdown Monday, ran for 198 yards in the game. He has 429 yards in
   the past three games. (Ted S. Warren -- AP)

   After a sluggish, injury-plagued start with the Lions, Kevin Jones has
   rushed for 476 yards in Detroit's last four games and has 703 yards for
   the season. He ran for 196 yards in a victory Sunday over the Arizona
   Cardinals.

   But the most promising NFL beginning belongs to Julius Jones, who has
   rejuvenated the Cowboys by running for 429 yards and five touchdowns on
   93 carries in three games since returning from a broken shoulder blade.
   He had 198 yards and three touchdowns in Monday night's wild, 43-39
   victory at Seattle, including the game-winning touchdown on a 17-yard
   scamper with 32 seconds to play as the Cowboys erased a 39-29 deficit
   in the final two minutes after squandering a 29-14, third-quarter lead.

   "The running back runs pretty good, in case you guys didn't notice,"
   Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells said in a news conference after the game.

   After a 1-6 stretch, the Cowboys have won two in a row and are among
   six NFC teams with 5-7 records. Those clubs are a game behind the
   Seahawks in the race for the conference's second wild-card spot. The
   Seahawks and Rams lead the NFC West with 6-6 records. The Rams hold the
   tiebreaker advantage by virtue of beating Seattle twice.

   "I honestly feel like we're better off as a team than at any point this
   year," Parcells said. "Not just because we won this game. We just have
   more balance in our attack. I told the team, what you do after
   Thanksgiving is what really counts. That's just a big win for us, and
   hopefully we can play well down the stretch to give us a chance."

   Panthers Persevere
   The Carolina Panthers could have given up. They were 1-7. Their injured
   reserve list kept growing until it included their top tailbacks
   (Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster), their star wide receiver (Steve
   Smith) and their Pro Bowl defensive tackle (Kris Jenkins). Their
   offensive line was a mess. All the luck they had during their run to
   the Super Bowl last season was being offset with misfortunes.

   But they didn't give up, and Coach John Fox perhaps has done an even
   better job this season than he did last season. The Panthers have won
   four straight games and, thanks to the forgiving nature of the NFC
   playoff chase, the defending conference champs still have a chance to
   reach the postseason.

   "For a while there, it just seemed like one blow after another," Fox
   said during his news conference Monday. "It never seemed to stop. Once
   it kind of stopped, people were able to reevaluate and we became a new
   team."

   End Julius Peppers sparked the defense with seven sacks in a four-game
   span before Sunday's 32-21 win at New Orleans. Quarterback Jake
   Delhomme has picked up his game, with 11 touchdown passes and two
   interceptions in the last five games. Wideout Muhsin Muhammad has taken
   Smith's place as the No. 1 receiver and has had three 100-yard
   receiving games during the winning streak, including a 179-yard
   performance against the Saints. Converted fullback Nick Goings has
   taken over for Davis and Foster at tailback and had his third straight
   100-yard rushing game Sunday by running for 122 yards on a laborious 36
   carries.

   The Panthers will face the Rams at home on Sunday in a rematch of
   Carolina's double-overtime playoff triumph on the road last season. The
   Rams will start veteran Chris Chandler at quarterback in place of Marc
   Bulger, who is injured. . . .

   Josh McCown is back to being the Cardinals' starting quarterback, but
   it's probably too late to save the season. In his first NFL start,
   rookie John Navarre suffered a chip fracture of his right ring finger
   during a loss at Detroit during which he threw four interceptions, and
   will be sidelined for two to three weeks. The Cardinals have lost three
   straight games, dropping to 4-8, since Coach Dennis Green abruptly
   benched McCown on the heels of a two-game winning streak. Shaun King
   started two games before Green opted to go to Navarre. . . .

   McCown's younger brother Luke, a rookie for Cleveland, could make his
   second straight start this week if Kelly Holcomb, who has three cracked
   ribs, is not able to play. Jeff Garcia remains hindered by a
   rotator-cuff injury. . . .

Wizards Can't Crack Nuggets

Washington's Streak Stopped at 4 Games: Nuggets 111, Wizards 105

   By Michael Lee
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Thursday, December 9, 2004; Page D01

   The Washington Wizards had three days off since their last game, enough
   time to reflect on the good feelings generated from winning four in a
   row and seven of their past eight. If the Wizards had their way, they
   probably wouldn't have waited so long to get back on the court, but it
   might not have mattered last night against the Denver Nuggets.

   The Wizards came into the game tied with the best winning percentage in
   the Eastern Conference but they left with a 111-105 defeat -- their
   first loss at MCI Center in five games -- and the realization that
   there is plenty of room for improvement, especially in transition
   defense.

   "We have to get over it," forward Jarvis Hayes said. "There is no other
   option. We were 10-5 and nobody ever thought we were going to go 67-0
   to close out the season. That's not how this league works."

   Point guard Gilbert Arenas scored 28 points and forward Antawn Jamison
   had 27, but the Wizards (10-6) dropped to 1-5 this season against teams
   with winning records. Their attempt to win five games in a row for the
   first time since February 2002 was dashed on a night when Nuggets point
   guard Andre Miller and his backup, Earl Boykins, a 5-foot-5 shot of
   energy, played the uptempo style the Wizards like to play -- only
   better.

   Miller hit nearly everything he put up, scoring a season-high 34 points
   on 15-of-25 shooting. Boykins moved up and down the court quicker than
   the Wizards could react, scoring 13 points and reminding Arenas of the
   season he played with Boykins in Golden State. "He's an Energizer
   Bunny," Arenas said. Miller and Boykins had eight assists each,
   combining for just three fewer than the Wizards (19).

   The Nuggets also controlled the middle with the interior defense of
   center Marcus Camby and forward Kenyon Martin, who combined to block
   five shots. Camby notched a season-high 16 points and grabbed nine
   rebounds. Baltimore native Carmelo Anthony didn't even have to play his
   best game, but he still finished with 23 points and seven rebounds.

   "We let them get comfortable," Wizards guard Larry Hughes said after
   scoring 15 points and grabbing eight rebounds. "They pretty much did
   what they wanted to do."

   The Nuggets shot 49.5 percent from the field and had 28 fast-break
   points, as they sent someone running toward the other end of the court
   almost every time the Wizards attempted a jumper.

   "Their big guys look to get the rebound, and by the time they get it,
   their guards have already taken off," Hughes said. "They got a lot of
   buckets by going over the top of us when we didn't get back. We'll fix
   that."

   The Nuggets, a Western Conference playoff team last season, have won 10
   of their last 13 games, including back-to-back wins against the
   Wizards' Southeast Division rivals Miami and Orlando coming into this
   game.

   The Wizards had to get the feeling that it wouldn't be their night near
   the end of the first half, when Jamison took a chance and paid the
   price. After Arenas made a three-pointer to bring the Wizards within
   seven points with 49 seconds left, Miller missed a jumper from the
   right baseline with less than two seconds remaining in the half.

   Jamison grabbed the rebound and quickly tried to deliver an outlet pass
   to Arenas, but Miller intercepted the ball and launched a shot from
   beyond the three-point line that bounced off the front of the rim, hit
   the back of the rim and rolled in to give the Nuggets a 60-50 lead.

   "I heard Gilbert," Jamison said, "and I kind of saw Andre and I tried
   to get it over him. I was thinking, if I get it to [Arenas], good. If I
   don't [Miller] won't have enough time to get the shot off. He proved me
   wrong. I can't make mistakes like that. That basket really hurt."

   Miller continued to hurt the Wizards in the third quarter, when he
   scored 11 points. He had two three-point plays, including a drive
   around Hughes on which Miller again got the benefit of a friendly roll.
   He added a short jumper to give the Nuggets a 79-67 lead with 4 minutes
   7 seconds left in the third quarter.

   Coach Eddie Jordan focused on the positive afterward. "If we can win
   Friday and Sunday," against New York and New Orleans, respectively,
   Jordan said, "and go 3-1 [on the homestand]. That's not bad for us."

Patriots Finally Prevail in Battle Of the Locals

George Mason Women 70, Georgetown 62

   By Kathy Orton
   Special to The Washington Post
   Thursday, December 9, 2004; Page D04

   The game between George Mason and Georgetown had everything a local
   women's basketball rivalry should have: wild momentum swings, scrappy
   play and even a little blood. The Patriots prevailed, 70-62, over the
   Hoyas at McDonough Arena last night before 347.

   It was George Mason's first win in this series since Nov. 29, 2000. The
   Patriots (2-3) had lost eight of the last nine against Georgetown
   (2-4).

   "It feels great," senior Lauren Hediger said. "We've had a rough start.
   We've mainly beat ourselves. It feels good to get a win."

   The freshmen of both teams were the stars on this night. Keyhana
   Wakefield scored a season-high 16 points to lead George Mason. Moni
   Akintunde (Laurel) added 13 points. Kieraah Marlow finished with a
   season-high 26 points for Georgetown.

   "We had thought they had potential," George Mason Coach Debbie
   Taneyhill said of her freshmen, "but they're young."

   The teams had traded the lead when Georgetown went ahead, 58-57, on a
   jump shot by Marlow with 3 minutes 30 seconds remaining. George Mason
   regained the lead after Jen Daniels made a pair of free throws. On the
   Hoyas' next possession, Varda Tamoulianis was called for a charge and
   that seemed to provide momentum for the Patriots. Daniels sank a
   three-point basket on the next trip down the court to put George Mason
   up 62-58.

   Georgetown was forced to foul over the final two minutes and the
   Patriots capitalized. They made six of six free throws to secure the
   win. For the game, George Mason made 21 of 26 free throws; the Hoyas
   were 12 of 18 from the line.

   Neither team shot the ball well. George Mason made only 33 percent of
   its shots from the field while Georgetown shot 35 percent. The Patriots
   did a good job holding two of the Hoyas' top scorers in check: Mary
   Lisicky, who leads the team with an average of 12.8 points per game,
   finished with four points on 2-of-11 shooting and Sarah Jenkins scored
   only five points.

   The teams fought hard from the outset. George Mason center Julie
   Flanders left the court at one point because of bleeding and played
   most of the game with a bandage on her chin.

   Georgetown started well, scoring on four of its first six possessions
   and surging to an 11-3 lead. George Mason, meantime, struggled to put
   points on the scoreboard. The Patriots made one field goal and scored
   five points the first eight minutes.

   George Mason's scoring drought ended when Hediger sank a three-point
   shot with 11:45 remaining in the half. Wakefield followed Hediger's
   three-pointer with one of her own, starting a 12-1 run that pulled the
   Patriots to 18-17.

The Terps' Comeback Kid

Kelley Is Undaunted, Even After Numerous Injuries

   By Eric Prisbell
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, September 10, 2004; Page D03

   On occasion, some Germantown residents refer to Chris Kelley in the
   past tense. They view his college career at Maryland as a failure, too
   much hype followed by too many injuries. Once, a local approached
   Kelley's older brother Mike, not knowing the two were related, and
   said, "Man, Chris Kelley was a disappointment at Maryland."

   It hurts the family because, after all, Kelley never asked for the
   fading scars below his knees that represent three surgeries in the past
   four years. He never wanted to struggle at quarterback and initially at
   safety after each rehabilitation. There were times the coaching staff
   wondered if Kelley, one of the most heavily recruited players on the
   team, would ever contribute.
   Maryland safety Chris Kelley (Seneca Valley High) has battled through
   three surgeries in five years. He had nine tackles in the season
   opener. (Preston Keres - The Washington Post)

   "I just know some people say, 'What's all the fuss about?' " Mike
   Kelley said. "I hope he puts that all to bed."

   For Kelley and his family, Saturday's game against Northern Illinois
   proved a monumental moment, ultimate relief. Finally, Kelley is
   healthy, starting and playing well. Said Kelley, "It's something I've
   been waiting for my whole life."

   At strong safety, he registered nine tackles against the Huskies, all
   while playing with the incessant zeal that those who know him best say
   defines his life. Even when he played quarterback, he competed with a
   linebacker's mentality.

   With Kelley's comeback an intriguing story line early in the Terps'
   season, his family granted numerous interviews this week. But the
   Kelleys are superstitious, said Mike Kelley, who added, "I'm just kind
   of nervous."

   Chris Kelley received similar publicity in April 2002 before Maryland's
   spring game. At the time, he had risen to No. 1 on the quarterback
   depth chart. He had battled back from two reconstructive left knee
   surgeries to repair torn anterior cruciate ligaments.

   He entered the 2002 spring game with his primary goal -- "to start for
   this university" -- within reach. During the game, Kelley cut one way
   and went another. He heard the familiar pop and knew: this time, his
   right knee.

   His family joined him afterward in the Gossett Team House. They all
   cried. And there were equally dark moments ahead.

   Soon after, Mike called Chris from work and heard sadness in his voice.
   Chris looked at the long road ahead instead of each incremental step.

   He underwent his third surgery on May 8, 2002, and then remained
   optimistic, engaging in a relentless rehab program in Silver Spring:
   underwater treadmills, balance beams, trampolines. His father remembers
   a therapist asking, "Can you do this?"

   He never had serious doubt. Kelley, 22, forged his perseverance, his
   aggression, from daily competitions against his brothers -- John, 23,
   and Mike, 28. A tattoo festooned to Kelley's bicep signifies family and
   is not far from his heart.

   The brothers weren't ones to sit indoors all day. "Chris and I are
   terrible video game players," said John Kelley, who played at Towson
   State and now coaches linebackers at Wesley College.

   The brothers played in the Kelley backyard, which is some 40 yards by
   30 yards, perfect for tackle football. No one is sure how grass still
   grew. Chris often played one-on-one football against John in the snow.
   They sometimes damaged the wooden fence, also known as the end zone,
   and hammered it back together. Some kids broke noses and bloodied
   faces.

MUCH ABOUT HISTORY

Video game allows you take aim at JFK

Assassination re-creation called 'despicable' by Sen. Kennedy spokesman

   A new video game is being released today in connection with the 41st
   anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, but not
   without controversy.

                               [jfkrshot2.jpg]
           Kennedy motorcade in ‘JFK Reloaded’ (Traffic Games)

   “JFK Reloaded” is being called “despicable” by a spokesman for
   Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, the late president’s brother.

   Yet Kirk Ewing, managing director of the Scottish game company Traffic,
   insists he and his team have nothing but respect for JFK, as well as
   history.

   “We believe that the only thing we’re exploiting is new technology,”
   Ewing told Reuters, explaining the game was designed to undermine the
   belief there was a clandestine plot behind the assassination. “We
   believe passionately there was no conspiracy.”

   The objective is to fire three shots at Kennedy’s motorcade in Dallas
   from assassin Lee Harvey Oswald’s sixth-floor perch in the Texas School
   Book Depository, all of which has been digitally re-created.

                               [jfkrshot3.jpg]
    Players simulate assassin role in ‘JFK Reloaded’ (Traffic Games)

   Points are awarded depending on how accurately the shots match the
   official version of events as documented in by the Warren Commission,
   which probed the assassination.

   Scores can also be subtracted for “errors,” such as striking first lady
   Jacqueline Kennedy.

   On its website, Traffic explains the technology used in the game is
   quite advanced, and answers questions in somewhat graphic terms
   regarding bullet and character performance.

   “The bullets travel through the air at the correct speed – they don’t
   instantly reach their target. Therefore you have to shoot in front of
   moving targets (“aim off”) in order to hit them. ….

   When bullets hit objects, they react according to the material they
   hit. For instance, they will pass through glass and upholstery
   unhindered; pass through flesh with some deflection; and either glance
   off or pass through bone, depending on the angle of impact.”

   The game is available for download for $9.99.

Arsenal face key revival test

   Can two wins reverse a slide? Arsenal have scored eight times in
   winning their past two games, but those goals could be as confetti on
   the breeze if they slip up against Chelsea at Highbury on Saturday.

   Bigger leads have been lost before, but victory would give Chelsea an
   eight-point advantage, and, such is the depth of their squad and their
   self-belief that their position at the top of the Premiership would
   seem all but impregnable.

   ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, however, was defiant on Friday, countering an earlier
   onslaught from Chelsea counterpart JosÃ© Mourinho with some wry
   ripostes. It was the Arsenal manager, though, who started this latest
   spat, wondering earlier in the week why more people did not support his
   side given they had "30 times less investment capacity" than either
   Chelsea or Manchester United.

   Mourinho replied on Friday by asking if JosÃ© Antonio Reyes had been a
   Christmas present, accusing the suspended Patrick Vieira of being out
   of control and then pointing out that whatever the result on Sunday,
   his team's fans would still be able to sing: "We're top of the league
   and having a laugh."

   "I do not think that you have fans who laugh when they lose their
   game," was Wenger's reply, and his defence of his record in the
   transfer market was equally forthright. That Vieira will miss
   Saturday's game remains an issue, however.

   "He has picked up the yellow cards because he was committed and he
   feels a little bit more responsibility when he plays next to a guy of
   17," Wenger said. "He's the one who represents the physical strength in
   there and I feel that's why he got punished more."

   The fact he is playing regularly next to a 17 year old indicates just
   how stretched Arsenal's midfield resources are with Gilberto Silva and
   Edu out through injury. The situation could worsen in January should
   Edu join Barcelona during the transfer window, as he suggested on
   Friday he would be keen to do.

   Cesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini, with all of 37 years between them,
   performed admirably against Rosenborg on Tuesday, but Frank Lampard and
   Claude Makelele present a different magnitude of opponent. And in that
   fact lies the fundamental doubt.

   Just as away defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool do not in
   themselves thrust a club into crisis, so victories over teams as
   mediocre as Birmingham and Rosenborg - emphatic as both were - are not
   necessarily signs of recovery.

   Wenger and forward Dennis Bergkamp both spoke of returning self-belief,
   but Saturday is the true test. If confidence really is the issue, it
   does not help that both the goals Arsenal have conceded in the past
   three games have been directly attributable to goalkeeper Manuel
   Almunia. Simply by not playing, Jens Lehmann's star has risen
   dramatically since being dropped for the Carling Cup defeat at Old
   Trafford 10 days ago. Wenger, though, would not be drawn on which of
   the two he will field.

   "There's enough pressure on the goalkeeper's job that you do not need
   to see it every time you open the newspapers," he said. "I said we had
   three big targets: to beat Birmingham, to qualify for the next phase of
   the Champions League and to beat Chelsea. So we are approaching target
   number three. That we have achieved the two first targets help us . . .
   believe we can reach the third."

   Hamilton agreed to be sacked to help Phonak team get licence [typk.jpg]
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-01 15:46:15

       GENEVA, Nov. 30 (Xinhuanet) -- Olympic time trial cycling champion
   Tyler Hamilton said he agreed to be sacked by Switzerland's only
   professional cycling team Phonak so as to help them get a licence for
   next year's Pro Tour.

   ¡¡Hamilton was sacked following his positive test in September for
   blood doping but the termination of his contract with the teamfailed to
   impress the world governing body the International Cycling Union (UCI).
   UCI earlier in the day confirmed its decision to withhold Phonak's
   licence.

       Hamilton's lawyer read out a letter at a press conference near
   Zurich in which the cyclist wrote: "We concluded together that it would
   not be possible for the team to continue at the level we hoped with my
   name on the roster.

       "Specifically, it would be impossible for Phonak to be acceptedinto
   the Pro Tour with one if its riders facing charges of using prohibited
   performance-enhancing methods."

       In a written response to an appeal made by Phonak last week, the
   UCI's licence commission said on Tuesday that the sacking of Hamilton
   had come too late to have any bearing.

       Hamilton was one of three Phonak riders to fail doping tests
   in2004, but the UCI commission said that "the attitude of the team's
   management" had aroused more serious reservations than the doping cases
   themselves.

       It said its decision was also based on the team's failure to comply
   quickly enough to UCI regulations concerning image contracts.

       "We had hoped my facing the judicial process alone... would pave
   the way for Phonak being included in the Pro Tour," Hamilton's letter
   continued. "We were very disappointed to learn today that the team
   would not be included after all."

       Phonak owner Andy Rihs said he still believed in Hamilton's
   innocence despite having been forced to sack him. Rihs added thatPhonak
   would continue to support the scientific board which is examining
   Hamilton's doping case.

       Rihs and team manager Urs Freuler said they had not yet
   decidedwhether to appeal to the international Court of Arbitration for
   Sport within the 15 day deadline.

       Beyond that, Rihs said the team would have to see if it could exist
   by seeking wildcard entries into major events like the Tour de France.

       Alternatively, the team could end the contracts of its top riders
   and spend next year contesting minor races.

       Rihs conceded that, in the worst case scenario, Phonak -- a hearing
   aid manufacturer -- may simply be forced to withdraw from professional
   cycling.

       "The question is still open," Rihs said. "We will just have tosit
   down with all the riders, and see how we can go forward." Enditem

                     Serie A: Adriano paces Inter Milan
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-18 09:25

    The Brazilian striker Adriano scored two goals Sunday as Inter Milan
                       beat Udinese, 3-1, in Serie A.

   An Andrea Pirlo strike gave AC Milan a 1-0 victory at Cagliari, moving
               Milan three points behind first-place Juventus.

     Chievo Verona moved up to third with a second-half goal from Matteo
                Brighi in an impressive 1-0 victory at Lazio.

   For Inter, Adriano opened the scoring at the San Siro with a scorching
     free-kick from 30 meters, or 90 feet, out and then made it 2-0 four
    minutes later with a solo effort, dribbling from deep in his own half
                             before firing home.

   After Stefano Mauri scored for Udinese, Christian Vieri made it 3-1 for
                  Inter with his first goal of the season.

     On Saturday, Juventus beat Messina, 2-1. The teams had entered the
   match unbeaten, but the traditional power topped the surprise team from
           Sicily with goals by Marcelo Zalayeta and Pavel Nedved.

   Messina, in Serie A for the first time since 1965, brought a huge group
    of supporters to Turin but was unable to produce another upset after
                    its triumphs over AC Milan and Roma.

   Juve took the lead in the 26th minute when Zalayeta, in for the injured
     David Trezeguet, headed home a Mauro Camoranesi cross. Ten minutes
                    after the break, Nedved made it 2-0.

    Vincenzo Montella showed a return to form as Roma won 2-0 in Livorno
              for its first away victory of the Serie A season.

    Montella set up the opening goal for Francesco Totti on the half-hour
   then scored his sixth of the season with a superb solo goal in the 69th
                                   minute.

Halkia win sends Athens crowd wild

   Fani Halkia sends the Athens crowd wild after victory in the women's
   400m hurdles final

   ATHENS, Greece -- Greek sensation Fani Halkia blitzed to gold in the
   Olympic women's 400 meters hurdles on Wednesday to send the home crowd
   wild.

   Halkia raced home in 52.82 seconds to thrash Romania's Ionela
   Tirlea-Manolache (53.38) and Ukraine's Tetiana Tereshchuk-Antipova
   (53.44).

   World champion Jana Pittman of Australia, running after a brave battle
   against injury, finished fifth and world record holder Yuliya
   Pechenkina of Russia was last after a wretched run.

   The 25-year-old winner, who came from nowhere to run the sixth fastest
   time in history during the semi-finals, knelt on the ground to kiss the
   track after her triumph as the crowd cheered.

   "I felt I would win when I came into the stadium," Halkia said, wearing
   a blue and white national flag around her shoulders. "The Greek soul is
   enough by itself. We don't need anything else. We were born winners."

   It was the biggest margin of victory in the event for the past five
   Games.

   "She did an awesome job," Pittman said. "It's a beautiful story for her
   to win in front of her home crowd."

   When Halkia, wearing yellow shades and sporting blond-tinted hair, was
   presented at the packed Olympic stadium the roars of "Hellas! Hellas!"
   were so loud that the names of her rivals could not be heard.

   Last to settle in her blocks after being drawn in lane four, she drew
   level with Pittman outside her at halfway before leading down the last
   100 meters and pulling further away after clearing the final hurdle.

   None of the pre-Games favourites had seen Halkia coming.

   Kept out of the international spotlight by her coaching team this
   season, the former high jumper was putting together an incredible
   series of performances, improving her personal best by almost
   three-and-a-half seconds in 12 months.

   A year ago she was a no-hoper, with a best of 56.40 -- a time which
   would have left her outside the first eight in any Olympic final
   stretching back to 1988.

   By Thursday, however, following her extraordinary run in the
   semi-finals when she clocked 52.77, she was the favorite with a
   personal best good enough to have won at any preceding Olympic Games
   since the event made its debut in 1984.

   That time would also have won any preceding world championships apart
   from 1995 in Gothenburg.

   Pittman tore a knee cartilage and underwent surgery less than three
   weeks ago before ignoring medical advice and undertaking a
   nine-hour-a-day rehabilitation programme in an attempt to run in
   Athens.

   She was given a one percent chance of running by the first specialist
   she consulted but refused to accept his opinion.

Johnson crashes out

   World high hurdles champion Allen Johnson literally crashed out of the
   Olympic Games, when he fell at the ninth flight in the second
   semi-final.

   The 1996 Olympic champion tripped on the ninth hurdle and flew headlong
   into the 10th. He lay sprawled on the track watching helplessly as his
   opponents crossed the line.

   "It's unfortunate. It happens to the best of us, you just have to move
   on. It's just one of those breaks," the American said.

   "You always have disappointments, Sydney showed that. I just have to
   take this one and keep going."

   Johnson finished fourth at the 2000 Sydney Games.

   On Wednesday he knocked over the fourth hurdle but quickly recovered
   after losing his balance.

   He recovered to draw level with the leaders but then fell over the
   ninth and ended his Olympics face down on the track.

   "At first I was a little nervous but I felt I could get myself in
   there. I thought I was ahead until the last one I hit but it was over,"
   he said.

Jones makes low-key return

   Triple champion Marion Jones made a low-key return to Olympic
   competition by successfully qualifying for Friday's women's long jump
   final.

   Jones, who won three gold medals at the 2000 Sydney Games, has
   qualified for the long jump only at Athens although she may run one or
   both relays.

   Her partner Tim Montgomery, the world 100 meters record holder, failed
   to qualify for the Games and has received a letter from the U.S.
   Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) alleging serious doping violations.

   Jones is also being investigated by USADA, although neither athlete has
   ever failed a dope test.

   Jones fouled her first attempt after waiting for an official to move a
   plastic cone from the runway. With her second, the American leaped 6.70
   meters, comfortably over the automatic qualifying distance of 6.65m.

   Jones won the 100 and 200 in Sydney and also got a gold medal in the
   4x400 relay.

   She finished third in the long jump and took another bronze in the
   4x100 relay to complete a record haul for a track and field athlete at
   a single Games.

Bekele and El Guerrouj both through

   Kenenisa Bekele, the new Olympic 10,000 meters champion, and Hicham El
   Guerrouj, the 1,500 meters winner, went head-to-head before both easing
   through to the 5,000m final.

   Bekele, seeking the first Olympic 5000-10,000 double since
   fellow-Ethiopian Miruts Yifter in 1980, won the heat in 13 minutes
   21.16 seconds.

   Morocco's Guerrouj, hoping for only the second 1,500-5,000m double in
   Games history after Finn Paavo Nurmi's 1924 success, jogged in third,
   timing 13:21.87.

   El Guerrouj, who won the 1,500 late on Tuesday, shadowed Bekele for
   most of the heat and looked ready for a fight with about 200 to go as
   he drew up close on Bekele's inside.

   But Bekele surged, as if to make clear he was ready for a fight, and El
   Guerrouj avoided a confrontation by slowing in the final straight.

   "It was tough but I tried to run easy," El Guerrouj said. "I have
   blisters from my shoes and I didn't sleep because of the joy I felt. I
   have not celebrated yet."

   Bekele's team mate Gebre Egziabher Gebremariam was second in 13:21.20.

   Algerian Ali Saidi Sief won the second heat, in 13:18.94, just ahead of
   Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya in 13:19.01.

   Bekele's world record, set in May, stands at 12:37.35.

Campbell powers to gold

   Jamaican speedster Veronica Campbell earned the Caribbean nation their
   first gold medal of the 2004 Games when she won the 200 meters in a
   searing time of 22.05 seconds.

   Campbell, who won bronze in the women's 100m on Saturday, clocked a
   personal best to finish well clear of United States teenager Allyson
   Felix who took silver in 22.18, a world junior record.

   Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas picked up bronze in 22.30 seconds.

   Campbell became only the second Jamaican woman track athlete to win
   Olympic gold. Deon Hemmings won the 400 meters hurdles in 1996.

   The race showcased a new generation of women's sprinters with a host of
   big names missing.

   Olympic champion Marion Jones failed to qualify for the event at the
   United States trials, although she did compete in Athens on Wednesday,
   qualifying for the final of the long jump.

   The first three across the line at last year's world championships --
   Americans Kelli White and Torri Edwards and Russian Anastasia
   Kapachinskaya -- are all serving drugs bans.

   France's Christine Arron, a pre-Games medal contender, failed to reach
   the final, as she did in the 100m.

   The 22-year-old Campbell was the fastest qualifier for Wednesday's
   final and imposed herself on the race from the start.

   She roared off the bend with a meter lead and the 18-year-old Felix
   could not haul her in despite clocking a fantastic time herself.

   Felix has been faster than 20.18 once before, running 20.11 at altitude
   in 2003, but the time was not ratified as no dope test was taken.

   Campbell looked a little nonplussed by her win but eventually set off
   on a lap of honor with team mate Aleen Bailey, who finished fourth.

   Ferguson, who anchored the Bahamas to the Olympic 4x100 relay gold in
   2000, clocked a season's best in third, although she never threatened
   the leading pair.

PSV consolidate Dutch league lead

                                                         story.psv.afp.jpg

   PSV's Jan Vennegoor in action during Sunday's 3-0 Dutch league win

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- PSV Eindhoven defeated Den Bosch 3-0 on
   Sunday to consolidate their lead in the Dutch first division while
   second-placed Feyenoord thrashed NAC Breda 4-0.

   Jefferson Farfan opened the scoring for PSV four minutes before the
   break, while second half goals by Alex and Philip Cocu sealed PSV's
   ninth win of the season.

   Dirk Kuijt netted the ball at the far post to give Feyenoord a 1-0 lead
   after 15 minutes.

   Two minutes after the break Bart Goor scored and Kuijt then missed a
   penalty four minutes later. Thomas Buffel struck the third goal in the
   87th minute and Goor grabbed a second in the 90th.

   Martijn Meerdink struck in the second minute for AZ Alkmaar who
   recorded a comfortable 4-0 win over Utrecht.

   Kenneth Perez scored a second six minutes into the second half and in
   the final five minutes Robin Nelisse and Olaf Lindenbergh completed the
   rout.

   AZ remain third on 24, three more then champions Ajax Amsterdam, who
   recovered from their humiliating 2-1 midweek Champions League defeat at
   Maccabi Tel Aviv to move into fourth place after a 3-1 win at Willem II
   Tilburg.

   Ronald Koeman omitted Dutch internationals Nigel de Jong, Johnny
   Heitinga and Wesley Sneijder but his team still won easily after an
   early own goal by Zdenek Grygera.

   Goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg and striker Wesley Sonck were also
   benched while American defender John O'Brien returned after almost a
   year of knee and hamstring injuries.

   The Ajax defense still looked vulnerable during the opening minutes
   when Tilburg's Jos van Nieuwstadt was left unmarked and gave Willem II
   the lead with a header.

   Ajax recovered when Argentinian winger Rosales scored his first goal
   for the club with a shot after 36 minutes.

   Rosales struck again two minutes before halftime when he finished off
   from a Rafael van der Vaart pass.

   Maxwell scored the third in the 62st minute and Koeman said: "The win
   is good for our team with the big match against Feyenoord next week
   coming up.

   "We gambled in our starting lineup, but given the hard situation Ajax
   is in right now everything is a guess."

                      Larkin leaving big shoes to fill
     __________________________________________________________________

                Leadership mattered as much as his bat, glove

   By John Fay
   Enquirer staff writer

                                                                   [photo]
   Reds GM Dan O'Brien (back, with manager Dave Miley) calls bringing back
                                                          Larkin unlikely.
                                                 The Enquirer/JEFF SWINGER

   The split between the Reds and Barry Larkin left the club with two very
   big holes to fill.

   The obvious one is at shortstop. The less obvious one is in the
   clubhouse - where he was the undisputed leader of the team since the
   mid-1990s and captain since 1997.

   Felipe Lopez and Anderson Machado will compete for the shortstop
   position.

   First baseman Sean Casey, tops among the Reds' position players in
   tenure, is the most likely candidate to replace Larkin as captain.

   "That's something we'll talk about in spring training," manager Dave
   Miley said.

   Larkin's leadership will be as hard to replace as his bat and glove,
   outfielder Adam Dunn said, adding that even someone as well-liked and
   respected as Casey can't just step into that role.

   "Barry just had so much respect in the clubhouse. ... I don't see
   anyone fitting easily into that role," Dunn said.

                                 MORE BARRY

                           • Poll: Do you agree with the Reds' decision?
                                      • Photo gallery of Larkin's career

   The Reds know the void they created. But with emphasis squarely on the
   future, it's hard to bring back a shortstop who turns 41 April 28.

   That's what general manager Dan O'Brien and Miley told Larkin when they
   called him Tuesday morning and said the club would not be offering him
   a contract.

   "We thanked him for everything he gave us in his 19 years," Miley said.
   "Barry was a good influence. ... He's had a good career. Basically,
   it's time for the two kids to get a chance to play."

   O'Brien said the decision was a baseball one. Larkin, who is a free
   agent, did not fit into the Reds' plans for 2005. Money was not an
   issue. In fact, Tuesday the Reds opened dialogue about re-signing free
   agent pitcher Paul Wilson.

   Chief executive officer Carl Lindner and chief operating officer John
   Allen signed off on the Larkin move, which was essential because
   Lindner twice stepped in and re-signed Larkin after a baseball decision
   was made to let him leave.

   "We had organizational meetings all last week and determined that the
   composition of our roster wouldn't include Barry," O'Brien said.

   If you go strictly by numbers, that doesn't look like a sound decision.

   Larkin had a good year statistically. He hit .289 and made only four
   errors in 85 games at shortstop. But two injuries - a strained
   abdominal muscle and a strained oblique muscle - forced him to miss 41
   starts from June through August without going on the disabled list. The
   injuries also robbed him of his range at shortstop.

   That highlighted the fact that Lopez, 24, and Machado, 23, are
   athletically superior to Larkin at this point in their careers.

   But neither is a sure bet.

   Lopez has 820 big-league at-bats. He hit .242 with seven home runs and
   31 RBI in 264 at-bats this year and struck out once every 3.2 at-bats.

   Machado has 56 big-league at-bats - all in September for the Reds. He
   hit .268, but he struck out once every 2.15 at-bats. Machado is a slick
   fielder, but he hit .230 in his minor-league career.

   "I can't commit to either one right now," Miley said. "Competition is a
   good thing. They'll both get an opportunity to go to spring training
   and win the job."

   Both are out of options - the Reds cannot return them to the minors
   without risking losing them through waivers - so they are virtually
   guaranteed roster spots.

   O'Brien said the Reds might look at bringing in a proven shortstop.

   "We're always looking to upgrade the roster," he said. "I can't say the
   door is closed. But is it likely? Probably not."

   Bringing back Larkin was not seriously considered.

   "Barry has been a starting shortstop for 19 years," O'Brien said. "With
   our decision (to go with Lopez and Machado), we did not see that role
   being available to him."

   No front-office role was discussed, because Larkin wants to play next
   year. But Larkin would like to end up with the Reds when he's through
   playing.

   "I still have those aspirations," he said. "But I can't work in the
   front office unless it's offered to me. I want to do that someday - if
   not with the Reds, then with someone else."

   Ticket Buy Tickets

   JACKSONVILLE, FL (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars are unbeaten and off
   to their best start since 1998. And adding to coach Jack Del Rio's
   excitement level is his belief that the Jags' offense is going to only
   get better. Jacksonville has managed a total of just 35 points in its
   first three games, yet it's allowed only 28 -- and the Jags have won
   three squeakers, most recently the 15-12 win over Tennessee on Sunday.
   Del Rio terms the offense "a work in progress." "I believe the guys are
   working hard at doing the things they need to do to be successful," Del
   Rio said Monday. "I remain encouraged that we're heading in the right
   direction, that we'll continue to develop. It's a young group. I think
   they'll get better with time together." Jacksonville hosts Indianapolis
   this Sunday; the Colts are averaging 33.3 points per game, and scored
   45 alone in their Week 3 win over Green Bay. Jaguars quarterback Byron
   Leftwich had his best effort of the season in the win over the Titans,
   completing 14 of 20 passes for 124 yards and one touchdown. Leftwich
   has seemed most comfortable in the shotgun, the primary formation he
   used as a star collegian at Marshall. Yet utilizing the shotgun on a
   regular basis may preclude running back Fred Taylor from getting his
   customary number of touches, and that worries Del Rio. "We want to run
   the football and you're limited in what you can do in the running game
   out of the shotgun," Del Rio said. "When you have a guy like Fred
   Taylor, you're not going to just sit in the shotgun. ... So we'll do a
   little bit of both." Notes: Jacksonville's home opener didn't sell out,
   meaning TV blackout rules went in effect. More than 10,000 tickets
   remain for the game against Peyton Manning and the Colts. "Certainly
   with a guy like Peyton and as much audibling as he does at the line of
   scrimmage, we'd love to have it really loud and really difficult for
   him to function," Del Rio said. ... TE Kyle Brady isn't expected to
   play against Indianapolis because his injured finger is now infected.
   Brady has missed all three games so far.

   BOWL NOTEBOOK

Petrino out, Miles eyed in LSU's search for Saban's successor

   By Associated Press  |  January 2, 2005

   Fresh off a victory in the Liberty Bowl, Louisville coach Bobby Petrino
   withdrew from consideration for the job at Louisiana State yesterday.

   He met with LSU officials during the week about replacing Nick Saban,
   who is leaving the Tigers for the NFL's Miami Dolphins. Arkansas coach
   Houston Nutt pulled out of contention for the LSU job Thursday.

   "LSU has a tradition-rich program with much to offer, but as I reflect
   on what we've accomplished in a short time here at Louisville, we're on
   the brink of establishing a great program that will compete for a
   national championship," Petrino said in a statement. "I want to be the
   coach who sees that through."

   He coached No. 7 Louisville to a 44-40 victory over No. 10 Boise State
   in the Liberty Bowl Friday. Louisville recently gave Petrino a raise
   from $550,000 to $1 million a season, plus incentive clauses.

   LSU had no immediate comment on Petrino's statement, spokesman Michael
   Bonnette said at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Fla., where the
   Tigers lost to Iowa, 30-25.

   Oklahoma State coach Les Miles is the top choice to replace Saban, a
   source close to the negotiations told the AP. Miles could be introduced
   early this week, the source said on the condition of anonymity.

   Franchione extended
   Texas A&M coach Dennis Franchione will get a contract extension and a
   raise after leading the Aggies to the Cotton Bowl in his second season.
   Athletic director Bill Byrne said Franchione's contract, currently
   worth $1.7 million annually through 2010, was being restructured. He
   didn't release the details. "He's done a great job with the talent we
   have and I look forward to a great future at Texas A&M," Byrne said
   before the Aggies (7-5) finished their season with a 38-7 loss to
   Tennessee, a big improvement from last year's 4-8 debacle. "We want to
   make sure Dennis Franchione continues to coach our football team." The
   deal is expected to be completed this month. Byrne would only say that
   Franchione would remain among the best-paid coaches in the country . .
   . West Virginia wide receiver Chris Henry plans to forgo his senior
   year to enter this spring's NFL draft. "I feel like I have nothing else
   to prove at the college level," Henry said following the Mountaineers'
   30-18 loss to Florida State in the Gator Bowl. "I'm looking forward to
   the next level." The 6-foot-5-inch Henry set a school record with 12
   touchdown catches this season and finished with 872 yards receiving
   after surpassing 1,000 yards a year ago.

   Klinsmann keeps options open
   [13oliver.jpg]
   Kahnʼs recent form has been erratic for Bayern Munich

   Frankfurt: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann is in no hurry to choose
   between goalkeepers Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann despite the
   destabilising effect the row is having on the countryʼs World Cup
   preparations.

   ʼThe competition goes on, and both goalkeepers accept that,ʼ Klinsmann
   said after naming both men in the squad to face Cameroon in a friendly
   in Leipzig on Wednesday.

   ʼThereʼs no other way. Both will have a fair chance and then weʼll see
   who is in goal in 2006. This is a luxury problem.ʼ

   The question as to who should take the gloves when Germany host the
   World Cup in a little over 18 monthsʼ time has become the major
   sporting debate in the country, with the two menʼs performances
   subjected to intense scrutiny every time they play.

   Kahn, now 35 and with 74 caps, was a commanding presence in Germanyʼs
   run to the 2002 World Cup final, but his mistake handed Ronaldo the
   opening goal as Brazil went on to take the trophy.

   His recent form has been erratic for Bayern Munich and Klinsmann
   decided to strip him of the captaincy and the regular number oneʼs
   position shortly after taking over as coach in July.

   Lehmann, the 34-year-old Arsenal goalkeeper, won his 20th cap in a
   friendly against Iran last month and will again start against Cameroon.

   The coachʼs rotation policy has drawn criticism from Bayern, who say
   the situation has put Kahn under pressure and led to his last-minute
   blunder in a recent 1-0 defeat against Juventus in the Champions
   League.

   Klinsmann rejected Bayernʼs request for an end to the debate on Friday.
   Instead, he plans to hold ʼround tableʼ discussions with new
   goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke and his three top ʼkeepers ʼ Timo
   Hildebrand is the third choice ʼ before the game against Cameroon.

   Yet another defeat shows Holyfield on the wane
   - DESPITE LOSS, Former heavyweight champion not ready to say goodbye
   [+uc('CLIFTON BROWN New York Times News Service')+]
   [15box1.jpg]
   Evander Holyfield takes a punch from Larry Donald during their
   heavyweight championship fight in New Yorkʼs Madison Square Garden on
   Saturday. (Reuters)

   Even if Evander Holyfield is not ready to leave boxing, most of his
   skills have already departed. Losing for the fifth time in his last
   eight bouts, Holyfield (38-8-2) was beaten by Larry Donald in a
   unanimous 12-round decision on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden.

   Nothing seems to convince Holyfield that the time has come to say
   goodbye, but maybe if he watches enough videotape of his most recent
   fights, something will persuade him to stop at age 42.

   In his prime, as a four-time champion, Holyfield would have surely
   brushed aside Donald (40-2-2), a 37-year-old journeyman. But Donald
   dominated this fight from the beginning, and in many rounds, Holyfield
   went long stretches barely throwing a punch, while being hit
   repeatedly.

   According to post-fight statistics, Donald landed 260 punches,
   Holyfield 78. The three judges scored the bout, 119-109, 119-109,
   118-109, but their verdicts were really not necessary.

   Holyfield was shaken a few times, but there were no knockdowns. Donald
   was good enough to punish Holyfield, and the former champion wasnʼt
   good enough to make a dent. Yet Holyfieldʼs post-fight comments
   indicated he wanted to keep fighting.

   ʼIʼve never given up on anything,ʼ he said. ʼIʼm going to pray on it. I
   felt good, better than the last time. He just landed more. I saw all
   the shots coming. I feel good. I thought maybe I hurt him a few times,
   but I didnʼt get off as much. I still feel that I can rise to the
   occasion, so why not continue to pursue the dreamʼ

   After the third round, Holyfieldʼs legs looked unsteady, and it was
   clear he would have trouble mounting a consistent attack. Even the
   crowd, which was pulling for Holyfield and chanted his name midway
   through the sixth round, was not enough to help.

   At the end of the sixth, the four-time champion ambled slowly back to
   his corner, looking weary and old. He would have saved everyone time if
   he had decided to quit at any point, but his pride would not let him.
   Holyfield had one brief shining moment in the ninth round, when he
   caught Donald with a right hand that rocked him. But not surprisingly,
   Holyfield failed to follow it up, giving Donald time to recover, and
   the one-sided beating continued.

   Donald was pleased with the victory, no matter how inept Holyfield
   looked.

   ʼAinʼt no doubt I won the fight,ʼ he said. ʼI won every round. Heʼs a
   seasoned veteran, and he can hurt you in the ring if you go to sleep.
   Heʼs very sneaky with his punches. This is the first step for me to
   becoming world heavyweight champion, which is my goal. I want to
   challenge all the world title belt holders because I think I earned a
   shot with my performance tonight.ʼ

   Indians hit back with record opening stand
   - Souravʼs advice provides India with ʼbindaasʼ start
   LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
   [23hall.jpg]
   (From left) Andrew Hall and Shaun Pollock kill time at their laptops,
   while India coach John Wright works out strategy in Kanpur on Monday as
   dense fog delayed the start on Day III. (PTI)

   Kanpur: ʼBindaas batting karna...ʼ was Team India captain Sourav
   Gangulyʼs advice to Gautam Gambhir on the eve of the first Test against
   South Africa.

   On Monday afternoon, Gambhir did just that. He even got to his (maiden)
   fifty before the flamboyant Virender Sehwag got his eighth and, at
   stumps on a fog-hit day, was on a par with his much more experienced
   opening mate.

   Both Sehwag and Gambhir are on 85 ʼ the youngsterʼs, by the way, has
   been quicker ʼ and their unbroken 185-run partnership has given India a
   Ferrari-like start.

   Of course, Sehwag could have been out twice and Gambhir (playing only
   his second Test) once, but then, Andrew Hall should never have gone as
   far as 163.

   Significantly, the Sehwag-Gambhir effort is Indiaʼs best since the 160
   between Sehwag and Akash Chopra in Multan eight months ago... Moreover,
   itʼs the highest versus South Africa and the best by an Indian pair
   here.

   There was nothing outrageous in the openersʼ approach, rather the runs
   came off pedigreed shots.

   Gambhir, it may be recalled, had a horrendous debut in Mumbai this
   month and, so, took guard with tonnes of pressure. Itʼs to his credit
   he didnʼt allow the weight of having flopped (on debut) and being up
   against a 500-plus score to unsettle him.

   Even if Gambhir doesnʼt add a run, he will be retained for the Calcutta
   Test and, in all probability, for the two Tests in Bangladesh as well.

   The statistical ʼachievementʼ apart, Sehwag and Gambhir have opened the
   possibility of India continuing at a frenetic pace ʼ currently well in
   excess of four an over ʼ and actually reaching a terms-dictating
   position by stumps on the fourth day.

   South Africa, for the record, prolonged their innings even though the
   first session on Day III was lost not to rain or seepage but fog.
   Graeme Smith finally declared at 510 for nine (the highest in India),
   some 39 minutes after lunch.

   The fog changed the Green Parkʼs visage and, for a while, it was
   impossible to spot anything. ʼI couldnʼt see ten metres away,ʼ remarked
   Anil Kumble, who has taken his tally to 430.

   He is, however, seeing his immediate target (435 wickets) very well...

   ʼThe fog upset our plans... Yes, we were cautious on the first two
   days, but that was inevitable as we have an inexperienced team,ʼ
   maintained South African coach Ray Jennings, adding ʼideally, we ought
   to have got the runs in a session less...ʼ

   Given the crawl, made to look worse by the Indiansʼ blitz, he had to
   make that admission.

   Reacting to the Indian assault, he said: ʼWeʼve seen a superb
   display... One must be prepared for anything when facing a top team...ʼ
   The coach, though, wasnʼt harsh on his bowlers led by the seasoned
   Shaun Pollock.

   Having been an opener, Team India coach John Wright was effusive.
   ʼVeeru and Gambhir batted brilliantly... Such a positive performance
   can, eventually, give us a chance... Letʼs see how the first couple of
   sessions go tomorrow,ʼ he told The Telegraph.

   Sourav echoed much the same thoughts.

   Scheduled start advanced

   Play on the last two days is going to begin early, at 9.00 am, assuming
   thereʼs no fog. Conditions permitting, play will continue till 5.30 pm,
   the idea being to make up the many hours lost on Monday.
