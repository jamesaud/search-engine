   In most elections in which the incumbent enjoys an economy with a
   healthy 3% annual growth rate, home ownership at record levels, and
   inflation and interest rates that are well within control, the
   economy's performance wouldn't be a problem. But despite the positive
   indicators, George Bush continues to be under attack, with economists
   decrying everything from his tax cuts to the gaping budget deficit.

   What's more, in a new TIME poll, 62% of Americans call economic
   conditions "only fair" or "poor." What's really going on here? Bush's
   problem, as anyone in Ohio or Pennsylvania will tell you, is jobs. Even
   after recent gains, company payrolls have 913,000 fewer workers than
   when Bush took office. The worst hit came right after 9/11, with 1
   million jobs lost, but the slide persisted throughout the recovery.
   Most voters don't watch GDP numbers, but they know how many of their
   neighbors are home watching TV on a Wednesday afternoon. "They just
   look around and see what's going on and use that to decide how to
   vote," says Ray Fair, a Yale University professor who has made a name
   for himself predicting presidential elections using economic
   indicators. And so when the government announced Friday that 144,000
   jobs had been added in August, both candidates jumped. Bush crowed to
   supporters at a minor league baseball stadium in Pennsylvania that the
   new jobs proved "our growing economy is spreading prosperity and
   opportunity." The John Kerry camp, meanwhile, argued that the number
   didn't even keep up with population growth. Said the Democratic
   challenger: "Bush is now certain to be the first President since
   Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression who didn't create a single new
   job." According to the poll, the economy is tied with terrorism as the
   most important campaign issue. So which candidate has the better plan?

   JOBS
   The August job growth was not quite enough to indicate real momentum.
   What's holding employment down? Each party has its whipping boy.
   Republicans like to blame lawsuits and regulation; Democrats point to
   offshore outsourcing. Economists aren't buying either explanation.

   They say that orange alerts and a steady stream of bad news from the
   Middle East make CEOs wary of any bold hiring moves; instead companies
   use temps and contractors, cutting them loose whenever sales look
   shaky. Rising health insurance premiums make it cheaper to buy better
   equipment than hire a new employee. "Businesses are more interested in
   using technology," says Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Wells Fargo.
   "They want to hire people only as a last resort."

   BUSH
   His economic plan relies on one of the bedrock principles of
   conservative thinking: cut taxes, and the economy will grow, bringing
   jobs along with it. But Bush has softened that position a bit with
   support for worker-retraining programs.

   KERRY
   He tries to take on health-care costs and offshore outsourcing in a
   single bound. In industries affected by outsourcing, Kerry would give
   companies a tax credit to offset the cost of worker benefits, making it
   cheaper to hire them.

   THE BOTTOM LINE
   Economists give Kerry credit for addressing the heart of the problem:
   workers are expensive. But economists have doubts about whether this
   limited policy will make a real difference. They are much less excited
   about Bush's tax cuts, which could fire up some consumer spending, but
   not enough to add jobs, and would worsen the deficit. "We can't afford
   them anymore," says Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One. Shrinking
   the deficit or making big changes to the health-care system, the
   experts say, would do more to shore up business confidence and boost
   hiring.

   TAXES
   Few economists doubt that the current Bush tax cuts, $290 billion in
   this year alone, helped stimulate the economy at first. Those rebate
   checks that arrived in the fall of 2001 helped prop up the economy
   during a dark period, and consumer spending helped the U.S. make its
   way to recovery. Now that the economy is improving, the calculus for
   tax cuts is different. Will cutting taxes further make a meaningful
   difference to the economy? And even if it does, can we afford to
   increase the deficit for the sake of tax relief?

   BUSH
   He wants to make existing tax cuts for individuals and corporations
   permanent. Bush argues that with reduced income taxes, families have
   more to spend, and with lowered corporate taxes, businesses can invest
   in equipment. Laura Bush gave an example in her speech at the
   convention: the owner of an Iowa tow-truck company who used the credits
   to modernize her fleet.

AB InBev approaches SABMiller in $330bn deal

   Dominic Walsh, Deirdre Hipwell
   Published at 12:01AM, September 17 2015

   One of the longest-running takeover sagas moved close to a conclusion
   yesterday after SABMiller told the stock market that it had received an
   approach from Anheuser-Busch InBev for a possible deal to create an
   estimated $330 billion brewing giant. After years of speculation, the
   Budweiser and Stella Artois maker finally broke cover amid fevered
   speculation, sending shares of SABMiller nearly 20 per cent higher to
   £36.14, valuing the group at £58.5 billion, excluding debt of $10.5
   billion. The mooted deal comes as investor appetite for large deals is
   rising and would create a brewing giant more than twice the size of
   Heineken and Carlsberg and responsible for nearly one in every three
   beers produced around the world. AB InBev confirmed that it had made an
   approach “regarding a combination of the two companies” and declared
   its intention “to work with SABMiller’s board toward a recommended
   transaction”. However, the brewer behind Foster’s said its board had
   “no further details about the terms of any proposal”. The Takeover
   Panel has set a deadline of October 14 for the US-Belgian suitor, which
   is backed by 3G Capital, a private equity group run by some of the
   richest men in Brazil, to announce its intention to make a firm offer
   or walk away. Key to the outcome could be the two biggest shareholders
   in SABMiller. Altria, the tobacco group, has a 27 per cent stake, and
   the Santo Domingo family, of Colombia, has 14 per cent. Analysts have
   long considered a move by AB InBe

Lloyds accused of ‘daylight robbery’ by MPs

   MPs have called on the Serious Fraud Office to investigate Lloyds
   Banking Group and one of its property advisers over allegations that
   they conspired to abuse the insolvency process. During a debate in
   parliament yesterday, Lloyds and Alder King, a firm of property valuers
   and receivers, were accused of “daylight robbery” by pushing small
   businesses to the wall as the bank sought to clean up its balance sheet
   after the financial crisis. Last night, Lloyds and Alder King
   strenuously denied the allegations. Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff
   Central, accused Lloyds of “colluding” with Alder King to manipulate
   the value of properties against which customers’ loans were secured. It
   was claimed this was done to put the bank’s business customers in
   breach of the loan-to-value ratios on their secured debts. Ms Stevens
   suggested that these were “good customer

Falling inflation puts the Fed on the back foot

   The US Federal Reserve’s dilemma about whether to raise interest rates
   for the first time in nearly a decade deepened yesterday after an
   unexpected decline in inflation. The Fed, which will make its decision
   today, wants US inflation to hit a “not too hot, not too cold” rate of
   at least 2 per cent to encourage more business and household spending.
   It wants to give itself room for manoeuvre by creating space between
   its policy rate and zero. The belief among most economists is that,
   once it has taken the initial decision to lift the cost of borrowing,
   it will increase it further in a series of gradual stages. However,
   data published yesterday showed that the consumer prices index was
   heading in the wrong direction. It fell by 0.1 per cent last month— the
   first decline in seven months — hit by falling petrol prices and a
   stronger dollar. Core CPI inflati

US army to prune Halliburton bills

   David Teather in New York

   The United States army will withhold payment of up to $60m (£32.8m) a
   month on future invoices submitted by Halliburton, the firm formerly
   run by vice-president Dick Cheney, due to a continuing dispute over
   work done in Iraq.

   The decision contradicted a statement issued by Halliburton on Monday
   saying that it had won a suspension of the longstanding threat to
   withhold payments.

   Shares in the oilfield services and construction company fell more than
   4% in early trade on Wall Street after the ruling was announced. They
   have dropped 16% since the beginning of the month.

   The decision puts Halliburton under further financial pressure. The
   company needs cash to pay for a $2.3bn settlement of asbestos injury
   lawsuits stemming from a division acquired during Mr Cheney's tenure as
   chairman and chief executive.

   The US army said it was withholding 15% of payments to Halliburton unit
   Kellogg Brown & Root for its contract to provide logistical support,
   including clothing and housing troops. A spokeswoman for the army field
   support command said that could amount to $60m a month.

   The army is alleging that Halliburton has been overcharging for its
   services in Iraq. A Pentagon audit leaked last week claimed that
   Halliburton had so far failed to adequately account for $1.8bn of bills
   submitted. Halliburton, which also has a contract to repair damage to
   the oilfields in Iraq, has total government contracts worth up to
   $18bn.

   The company said it would fight the army's decision in court.
   "Halliburton is confident the government action is not justified," it
   said.

   Halliburton tried to explain its gaffe on Monday, when it claimed to
   have been given assurances that the army would grant an extension. It
   said that statement was "accurate at the time based on clear oral
   assurance from senior Pentagon representatives". The US army had twice
   extended the deadline on the threat to withhold 15% while
   investigations continued.

   Halliburton said it did not believe the Pentagon action would hurt its
   liquidity because it intended in turn to withhold 15% of payments to
   its subcontractors.

   The company has become a liability for the Bush administration as it
   stumbles from scandal to scandal. Halliburton has argued it is the
   victim of a smear campaign.

   Crude oil futures prices surged by almost $2 a barrel yesterday, the
   biggest increase in two months, after the Energy Department reported
   that United States oil supplies had declined more than expected.

   Oil inventories fell 4.2 million barrels last week, to 287.1 million
   barrels, the lowest since the week ended March 12. Supplies had been
   expected to drop by 400,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg News
   survey of analysts. Oil prices have declined in seven of the last nine
   sessions on an easing of concern that supplies from Iraq would be
   disrupted.

   "Refiners are chewing through a great deal of crude oil," said John
   Kilduff, senior vice president for energy risk management at Fimat USA,
   a brokerage unit of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale.

   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude oil for
   October delivery rose $1.88, or 4.5 percent, to settle at $44 a barrel,
   the steepest increase since July 1. Prices have declined almost 10
   percent from a record $48.70 a barrel on Aug. 19, but remain more than
   one-third higher than they were a year earlier.

   The rise in prices accelerated in the last few minutes of trading
   yesterday because Flint Hills Resources, a unit of Koch Industries, had
   a fire at its refinery in Corpus Christi, Tex. The refinery has a
   processing capacity of 300,000 barrels a day, according to the
   company's Web site.

   "We came down so much, so quickly," said Juha Laiho, a trader in
   Houston with the Finnish energy company Fortum. "Prices jumped because
   the crude number was such a surprise. There isn't a lot of excess."

   Crude oil inventories were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, after
   being up 4.6 percent a week before, the Energy Department said.
   Refineries ran at 95.7 percent of their capacity, one percentage point
   higher than during the period a year earlier, after a 0.3 percentage
   point decline the previous week.

   "The supply concerns that have pervaded the market this year are
   returning to the fore," Mr. Kilduff said.

   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps
   about a third of the world's oil, has increased production quotas in an
   effort to lower prices.

   Starbucks Corporation

   part of an ongoing thread, and are out of context when presented here.

   I believe I detected a breath of life coming from this horse, so I
   thought I would flog it one more time. Anyway, nobody's posted anything
   today, so consider this a time waster from yours truly, special
   'delibery' for TheResultsKid.
   Because it's about RESULTS.
   Since McDonald's has been so lauded, you know, 30,000 locations and
   all, and all the real estate and everything, I thought I would look at
   RESULTS for McDonald's and contrast them with Starbucks.
   These figures are from the McDonald's annual report, available at
   www.mcdonalds.com in PDF format, and likewise from the Starbucks annual
   report, also in PDF format at www.starbucks.com
   I offer three lines of numbers for each: total revenues, operating
   income, and net income. There's no math here, just seeing a trend as
   you let your eye slide from right to left, ascending through the years,
   from 1995 to the most recent figures in the respective annual reports.
   You can see McDonald's continues to build revenues nicely all
   throughout the period. But on the next line, they don't manage to
   convert that to income. In fact, whoa! We find that McDonald's is
   sporting roughly the same operating income today that they did in 1995.
   Net income? Hasn't changed in those eight years.
   Now do the same exercise with Starbucks; note the nicely ascending
   total revenues year over year. Also note in the next line - and the
   next - that they continue to convert income into earnings on an
   increasing pace, consistent with the increase in revenues.
   Oh. The charts:
McDonalds (in millions)
        2003   2002   2001   2000   1999   1998   1997   1996  1995
revs $17,140 15,406 14,870 14,243 13,259 12,421 11,409 10,687 9,795
op   $ 2,832  2,113  2,697  3,330  3,320  2,762  2,808  2,633 2,601
net  $ 1,471    893  1,637  1,977  1,948  1,550  1,642  1,573 1,427
Starbucks (in millions)
       2003   2002   2001   2000   1999   1998   1997   1996  1995
revs $4,100  3,300  2,600  2,200  1,700  1,300  1,000    770   500
op   $  425    316    280    212    157     not shown on chart
net  $  268    213    180     94    101     68     55     42    26

   Everybody hits a rough patch now and then. McDonald's number in 2002 is
   abysmal; Starbucks didn't have a great 2000. But McDonald's hasn't
   moved the meter much in eight years. I'm glad they have all that real
   estate; it's arguably a better investment than their burger franchise.

Alitalia Tells Unions of Plan to Lay Off 5,000 Workers

   MILAN, Sept. 6 - Alitalia, the Italian government-run airline and a
   partner with Delta and Air France in the SkyTeam alliance, told its
   unions on Monday that it planned to lay off about 5,000 of its 21,000
   employees in a move to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.

   In addition to the dismissals, the airline's chief executive, Giancarlo
   Cimoli, said Alitalia would further pare its payroll by not renewing
   the contracts of another 1,000 seasonal workers. The job cuts are part
   of a general restructuring presented to union leaders on Monday that
   includes a plan to split Alitalia's flight operations and ground
   services into separate units.

   While some union leaders said they would accept the Alitalia plan as
   the only chance to keep the airline from failing, others promised
   strikes. Many unions will meet Tuesday in Rome to formulate a response
   to Mr. Cimoli's plan.

   An agreement between management and the unions is crucial to the
   company's survival because the Italian government has said it would not
   guarantee a 400-million-euro loan ($480 million) that Alitalia needs
   unless the unions accepted the restructuring plan.

   Mr. Cimoli said last week that without the loan, which would provide
   money to run operations for six months, Alitalia has money to pay
   salaries and cover other costs only through the end of the month.

   The airline did not say when the job cuts would be made, but it did say
   that they would save the airline 315 million euros in the next two
   years, suggesting they would come in that time. Of the jobs lost, 1,570
   will be in the flight operations area and will include 1,050 flight
   attendants, 450 pilots and 70 people connected to ticketing and other
   customer services. The rest of the cuts will be in other areas and will
   include 1,440 maintenance workers.

   The plan presented by Mr. Cimoli forecasts that Alitalia's revenues
   will increase 13 percent from last year to 2006.

   If Mr. Cimoli successfully closes the negotiations with the unions, it
   would come after more than a year of meetings between management and
   labor representatives. His two predecessors clashed with unions over
   planned job cuts -- and eventually lost their own jobs because they
   could not reach an accord.

   A previous restructuring plan also called for 5,000 job cuts, and even
   though that was scaled back to 3,300, the unions still rejected the
   idea and held a series of strikes in April and May that forced Alitalia
   to cancel 1,250 flights.

   The battle between management and the unions took on a political
   dimension in recent months as the various political parties that make
   up the coalition of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister,
   disagreed over what to do with Alitalia. The dispute almost led to a
   government crisis earlier in the year.

   The government owns 62 percent of Alitalia and has taken an active role
   in trying to resolve the airline's financial crisis. Mr. Berlusconi
   said over the weekend that he was watching Mr. Cimoli's work closely.
   The government also has a majority stake in the electricity producer
   Enel and is the largest shareholder in Eni, the Italian oil company,
   and in Finmeccanica, an industrial conglomerate. But it has played a
   more discreet role in guiding those companies.

   If an accord is not reached by the beginning of October, Alitalia could
   be forced into bankruptcy protection. Under Italian law, the airline
   would then be put into extraordinary administration, which would make
   it easier to lay off workers and could lead to liquidation.

   The 400-million-euro loan would be guaranteed by the government, but
   provided by banks. The European Union, which allows its members to
   grant or guarantee short-term loans to help financially troubled
   companies while they restructure, has approved the bailout. The loan
   would be for six months and would then be renewable for another six
   months, to give Alitalia time to reduce its work force and seek other
   financing through a capital increase, perhaps by selling additional
   shares.

   Mr. Cimoli, who said his restructuring plan would return Alitalia to
   profitability in two years, may give further details on the capital
   increase at a shareholders' meeting scheduled for Wednesday. The
   company has had an operating loss for the last five years and in 2003
   had a net loss of 511 million euros.

   If adopted, the plan would be the first concrete response by Alitalia
   to the airline crisis brought on by the terrorist attacks in the United
   States in 2001. Since then, some airlines, like British Airways, have
   been able to restructure by laying off thousands of employees while
   others, like Air France, have sharply cut costs. Alitalia has until now
   been unable to formulate a response to the sector's financial crisis.

   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief executive of Air France, said earlier that
   the airline was ready to link up with Alitalia after it restructured.
   The two airlines already have cross-shareholdings and commercial
   agreements. Air France merged with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines earlier
   this year.

AB InBev approaches SABMiller in $330bn deal

   Dominic Walsh, Deirdre Hipwell
   Published at 12:01AM, September 17 2015

   One of the longest-running takeover sagas moved close to a conclusion
   yesterday after SABMiller told the stock market that it had received an
   approach from Anheuser-Busch InBev for a possible deal to create an
   estimated $330 billion brewing giant. After years of speculation, the
   Budweiser and Stella Artois maker finally broke cover amid fevered
   speculation, sending shares of SABMiller nearly 20 per cent higher to
   £36.14, valuing the group at £58.5 billion, excluding debt of $10.5
   billion. The mooted deal comes as investor appetite for large deals is
   rising and would create a brewing giant more than twice the size of
   Heineken and Carlsberg and responsible for nearly one in every three
   beers produced around the world. AB InBev confirmed that it had made an
   approach “regarding a combination of the two companies” and declared
   its intention “to work with SABMiller’s board toward a recommended
   transaction”. However, the brewer behind Foster’s said its board had
   “no further details about the terms of any proposal”. The Takeover
   Panel has set a deadline of October 14 for the US-Belgian suitor, which
   is backed by 3G Capital, a private equity group run by some of the

Lloyds accused of ‘daylight robbery’ by MPs

   MPs have called on the Serious Fraud Office to investigate Lloyds
   Banking Group and one of its property advisers over allegations that
   they conspired to abuse the insolvency process. During a debate in
   parliament yesterday, Lloyds and Alder King, a firm of property valuers
   and receivers, were accused of “daylight robbery” by pushing small
   businesses to the wall as the bank sought to clean up its balance sheet
   after the financial crisis. Last night, Lloyds and Alder King
   strenuously denied the allegations. Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff
   Central, accused Lloyds of “colluding” with Alder King to manipulate
   the value of properties against which customers’ loans were secured. It
   was claimed this was done to put the bank’s business customers in
   breach of the loan-to-value ratios on their secured debts. Ms Stevens
   suggested that these were “good customer

Falling inflation puts the Fed on the back foot

   The US Federal Reserve’s dilemma about whether to raise interest rates
   for the first time in nearly a decade deepened yesterday after an
   unexpected decline in inflation. The Fed, which will make its decision
   today, wants US inflation to hit a “not too hot, not too cold” rate of
   at least 2 per cent to encourage more business and household spending.
   It wants to give itself room for manoeuvre by creating space between
   its policy rate and zero. The belief among most economists is that,
   once it has taken the initial decision to lift the cost of borrowing,
   it will increase it further in a series of gradual stages. However,
   data published yesterday showed that the consumer prices index was
   heading in the wrong direction. It fell by 0.1 per cent last month— the
   first decline in seven months — hit by falling petrol prices and a
   stronger dollar. Core CPI inflati

   The American and Belgian arms of KPMG International, a global
   accounting cooperative based in Switzerland, have agreed to pay $115
   million to settle claims of accounting malpractice growing out of the
   collapse of a Belgian speech-recognition software company.

   Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products, the Belgian company, was founded in
   1987 and became a highflying symbol of new technology in the late
   1990's before collapsing into bankruptcy at the end of 2000 amid
   charges of accounting irregularities and criminal fraud.

   Yesterday's agreement, if approved by the court, would end KPMG's
   involvement in a shareholder class-action lawsuit filed in 2000 in the
   United States District Court in Boston. The lawsuit charged KPMG with
   misconduct in failing to stop Lernout from filing misleading financial
   statements.

   In related litigation, KPMG has been sued by former shareholders of
   companies acquired by Lernout in swaps for inflated stock that became
   worthless when Lernout went bankrupt. KPMG declined yesterday to
   identify which of those suits had been settled or which are pending.

   At its peak, Lernout's stock topped $70 on Nasdaq, valuing the company
   at more than $10 billion, and Lernout used its overvalued shares to
   acquire rivals like Dictaphone. ScanSoft, based in Boca Raton, Fla.,
   acquired Lernout's major technology assets in 2001 for $51 million.

   The class-action settlement with Lernout's shareholders would be the
   second-largest ever paid by KPMG, after the $125 million resolution
   reached last year in connection with its role as auditor of Rite-Aid, a
   drug store chain that inflated the sales and earnings it reported in
   the late 1990's. In both cases, KPMG denied all accusations of improper
   conduct.

   "Our decision to settle this litigation is based on practical business
   reasons, and saves the firms from protracted legal battles beyond the
   four years already spent on this matter," KPMG said yesterday in a
   written statement issued on behalf of Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler
   Bedrijfsrevisoren in Brussels and KPMG L.L.P. in New York. KPMG said
   that it had been a victim, along with investors, of a "massive, complex
   and cleverly conceived fraud" on the part of Lernout's executives,
   officers and third parties.

   The settlement reflects a trend in the last decade in which major
   accounting firms have been drawn into -- and paid large sums to get
   released from -- litigation growing out of major financial scandals.
   The lawsuits typically include a mix of charges covering both
   accounting irregularities that the auditors failed to spot and other
   instances where the big accounting firms identified questionable
   practices but did not stop their clients from issuing reports based on
   them.

   "I don't think there is a Big Four leader in getting sued," said Julie
   Lindy, editor of Inside Public Accounting, a monthly newsletter
   published in Atlanta, referring to KPMG and its three main rivals,
   Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

   Yesterday's settlement would rank just outside the top 10 settlements
   by the big accounting firms, according to Mark L. Cheffers, chief
   executive of Accountingmalpractice.com, a Web site that tracks the
   industry.

   He said that the largest settlements were made by Ernst & Young, which
   paid $400 million in a global settlement growing out of its role in the
   savings and loan scandals of the 1980's and $335 million to
   shareholders of Cendant in a securities fraud case.

   Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, investors who bought Lernout
   stock in the Nasdaq market or traded options from April 28, 1998,
   through Nov. 9, 2000, could file a claim.

   The lawsuit charged that Lernout and its top executives illegally
   inflated revenues by $377 million in that period through various
   schemes, including booking revenue the company never received from a
   Korean unit and setting up shell companies to pay fictitious revenue to
   Lerner for licenses to its software.

   "There were tens of thousands of shareholders deceived," said Jeffrey
   C. Block, a member of the legal team representing the shareholders.
   "KPMG missed all kinds of red flags."

   Yellow Roadway (YELL) boosted its third-quarter earnings guidance to
   $1.30 to $1.35 a share, a dime better than its previous forecast.

   The trucking company cited "a more disciplined pricing environment" and
   operating efficiencies. The company was created 14 months ago when
   Yellow Corp. acquired Roadway Services for about $48 a share in cash
   and stock.

   Five analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were expecting earnings of
   $1.25 a share for the third quarter.

   The stock rose $1.11, or 2.6%, to $43.50 Tuesday morning.

   Northwest Airlines disclosed an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and
   Exchange Commission into the airlineâs accounting practices for its
   pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The carrier defended its
   conduct: âAll of our (pension) assumptions are fully disclosed within
   our 10-K (annual report). We think they are prudent and responsible and
   we think they are completely in line with established and appropriate
   practices,â said Chief Executive Douglas Steenland Douglas Steenland .
   âWe believe our accounting practices are sound and we are fully
   cooperating with this request,â said Bernard Han Bernard Han ,
   Northwestâs chief financial officer, during the firmâs quarterly
   conference call Wednesday with Wall Street analysts. The SEC has made
   similar recent requests of Ford Motor , General Motors and Delphi .
   Northwest operates three pension plans for its employees. They cover
   some 72,000 current and retired salaried employees, pilots and other
   union workers. This year, Northwest expects to contribute $253 million
   to the plans. âNorthwest always makes the list of top companies with
   underfunded plans,â said Guy Meek, president of the Professional Flight
   Attendants Association. âIt is always a concern. â¦We want to see them
   funded 100 percent.â

DreamWorks casts line at $890m float

   Buoyed by the success of the animated film Shark Tale, DreamWorks
   Animation executives are expected to meet investors this week to
   prepare a public offering worth as much as $US650 million ($889
   million).

   Jeffrey Katzenberg, the animation unit's chief executive who is
   responsible for the huge hits Shrek and Shrek 2, was expected to leave
   as early as tomorrow on a roadshow for the initial public offering,
   with the hope of selling shares by late this month or early next month,
   those involved said.

   The share sale is expected to be the biggest initial offering in the
   entertainment business since MGM went public seven years ago with a
   $US180 million IPO.

   The offering would allow the company's founders - Steven Spielberg,
   David Geffen and Katzenberg - and its original backers to recoup some
   of their $US1.1 billion investment.

   DreamWorks had been unusually quiet about the offering, said Hal Vogel
   of Vogel Capital Management.

   "But it seems they plan to ride the coat-tails of the excitement and
   profitability of the genre."

   DreamWorks executives had been debating for months about when would be
   the best to time to sell shares, sources said. They had discussed
   holding the offering before the release of Shark Tale but were
   concerned about the health of the sharemarket and how the
   computer-animated movie would fare.

   When DreamWorks executives discussed selling shares before the release,
   they planned to meet investors in September. But when the market
   sputtered in August, some advisers suggested waiting. Now with two
   recent hits under its belt, Shrek 2 and Shark Tale, the company has
   decided to take the plunge.

   Shark Tale, a comedy about gangster-like fish that features the voices
   of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger and Jack Black, has
   shown earning endurance in its second week in theatres, despite mixed
   reviews. It brought in $US31.3 million at the US box office last
   weekend, according to the internet site http://www.boxofficemojo.com,
   which tracks ticket sales.

   Since opening on October 1, the movie has earned $US87.7 million. That
   follows on the success of Shrek 2, which has earned $US877 million
   worldwide and is the No.1 movie of the year.

   DVDs of Shrek 2 go on sale next month ahead of the important holiday
   season. The Incredibles, a movie created by Pixar Animation Studios,
   will also be released in November and is sure to generate even more
   interest in computer-generated films.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last July,
   DreamWorks Animation said it planned to spend about $US175 million of
   the money raised in the offering for general corporate purposes, and
   use the rest to pay down some or all of the debt it intends to assume
   from DreamWorks SKG.

   The company will be controlled by Mr Geffen and Mr Katzenberg, largely
   through class B shares that will give them and the original investors
   majority ownership and super-voting rights.

   That should protect DreamWorks Animation from any potential takeover.

   Mr Spielberg will not play a significant role in the company and he is
   not even named as a potential board member.

   According to one person who knows him, much of his wealth is tied up in
   trusts for his children and he does not want to divulge how much he
   earns each year.

   The offering was not risk-free, analysts said, as DreamWorks Animation
   planned to release two animated films a year. That is more than Pixar
   Animation Studios, the highly successful animation studio that has
   produced only one movie a year in recent years.

   The roadshow is expected to last for three weeks.

NAB may keep British banks

   National Australia Bank chief executive John Stewart yesterday
   dismissed recent speculation about the possible sale of its four banks
   in Britain as the work of investment bankers "trying to drum up work".

   But while he said no decision had been made, he gave the strongest
   indication yet that the nation's largest lender was likely to retain
   Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank.

   Mr Stewart, speaking before the formal launch of NAB's $250 million
   development in Melbourne's Docklands, said: "Everything is on the
   agenda but in terms of likelihood it is very unlikely that we would
   sell the banks on the mainland. It is not out of the question, but it
   is unlikely.

   "At this point of time it is probably unlikely that we would sell the
   Irish banks - Northern Bank and National Irish Bank - but if you are
   looking at the degrees of things it is a bit more likely."

   He added that there was no "grand announcement" planned to coincide
   with the full-year results on November 10.

   His comments followed the latest speculation in the British press, with
   Lazard, the investment bank reviewing the banks, having been reported
   as sending a memorandum to possible buyers saying the Irish banks were
   to be sold as a pair.

   Senior executives from NAB, developer and builder Lend Lease, owner
   General Property Trust, architects Bligh Voller Nield and Victorian
   Premier Steve Bracks yesterday attended the opening ceremony for the
   eye-catching office at Victoria Harbour. The building will accommodate
   3500.

   The dominant feature of National @ Docklands (N@D) is an atrium rising
   eight storeys to a steel-framed glass ceiling. The wings are crossed by
   gangways.

   NAB Australia chief executive Ahmed Fahour said the building was
   symbolic of the bank's efforts to rebuild its structure and culture and
   to support the integration of its two core businesses, retail banking
   and wealth management.

   NAB shares rose 1 ¢ to $27.08.

UK billionaire steels the whole show

   producing 57 million tonnes of crude steel a year.

   Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's fifth-richest man and a prominent donor to
   the British Labour Party, is now the boss of the world's biggest steel
   company, after a $US21 billion ($A28 billion) deal involving three
   different steel businesses.

   The transactions are likely to propel Mr Mittal up the lists of
   Britain's richest people. He and his wife Usha will control 88 per cent
   - which will be worth $US18.5 billion after the merger - of the new
   business.

   Separate accounts released yesterday showed that Mr Mittal also paid
   himself a $US2 billion dividend this year, dwarfing the £460 million
   ($A1.1 billion) dividend Arcadia Group paid to retail entrepreneur
   Philip Green last week.

   In recent months, Mr Mittal has been rivalling Mr Green for the most
   glamorous ways to spend a fortune. While Mr Green famously celebrated
   his 50th birthday at a £5 million toga party in Cyprus, Mr Mittal spent
   an estimated £30 million hiring a 17th-century French chateau for his
   daughter's wedding in June.

   A month earlier, the tycoon reportedly bought a £70 million 12-bedroom
   mansion in London - with Turkish baths, a ballroom and a bejewelled
   basement swimming pool - from formula one racing boss Bernie
   Ecclestone.

   Mr Mittal was not available for comment. However, Mr Green said last
   night: "This is not a competition. If his business can support it, good
   luck to him. Well done."

   In the complex series of transactions, Mr Mittal, 54, is merging
   privately owned LNM Holdings, which paid him the $US2 billion dividend,
   with his listed vehicle, Ispat International, to create Mittal Steel in
   a $US13.3 billion deal.

   At the same time the newly formed Mittal Steel is buying International
   Steel Group, a collection of American steel mills, for $US4.5 billion,
   creating what Mr Mittal described as a new "global powerhouse".

   The combined business, with annual revenue of $US30 billion and 165,000
   staff in 14 countries, will be listed on both the New York Stock
   Exchange and Euronext in Amsterdam. Its headquarters will be in
   Rotterdam.

   Mr Mittal, who will become chairman and chief executive of Mittal
   Steel, said in a statement: "These transactions dramatically change the
   landscape of the global steel industry. In recent years, the steel
   industry has been characterised by predominantly regional
   consolidation."

   The merger of the third and 13th-biggest producers will create the
   largest steel maker in the world, producing 57 million tonnes of crude
   steel a year. Luxembourg's Arcelor will be No.2, with 42.8 million
   tonnes. Steel prices have soared recently due to booming demand in
   China.

   The statement added: "This combination represents a significant step
   forward in the globalisation of the industry. The combined company will
   have excellent positions in raw materials, particularly coal, coke and
   iron ore, as well as strong positions in key end sectors."

   Rodney Mott, who helped to create ISG from a collection of struggling
   steel mills into a single group over the past three years, becomes
   chief executive of Mittal's US operations, while Mr Mittal's son Aditya
   will be chief financial officer.

   Mittal Steel is likely to make an operating profit of between $US6.8
   billion and $US7 billion on pro forma revenue of $US31.5 billion in
   2004.

   Gnawed by Northwest. Joining an apparent feeding frenzy, Northwest
   Airlines on Tuesday said it plans to expand in Indianapolis, a move
   that will knock rival ATA Airlines from its No. 1 spot on its home
   turf. The announcement came a week after ATA parent ATA Holdings filed
   for bankruptcy protection. However, Northwest, led by President and
   Chief Executive Douglas Steenland Douglas Steenland , said the
   expansion has been on the drawing board since 2001. Further west, ATA
   confronted a challenge Monday from another discounter, Southwest
   Airlines . Considered by many the discount category killer, CEO Gary
   Kellyâs Southwest announced plans to expand at Chicagoâs Midway
   Airportâanother prime hub for ATA. Meanwhile, ATA said it would sell
   its operations at Midway and gates at La Guardia Airport in New York
   and Reagan National Airport in Washington to AirTran for $87.6 million.

   GEORGETOWN, Del., Nov. 15 - Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of
   the Walt Disney Company, played down his decades-long relationship with
   the former Disney president Michael S. Ovitz on Monday, as he began
   testifying in a shareholder lawsuit over the board's handling of Mr.
   Ovitz's brief and controversial tenure in the mid-1990's.

   Mr. Eisner described Mr. Ovitz as charming, clever and an enjoyable
   dinner companion over their years in the entertainment business, but
   disputed Mr. Ovitz's previous testimony that the two men were close
   friends.

   "Michael Ovitz had a lot of best friends," said Mr. Eisner, wearing his
   signature Mickey Mouse tie. "Michael Ovitz was -- is -- a salesman, and
   we all deal in hyperbole."

   Mr. Eisner added: "We're talking semantics here."

   Mr. Eisner's testimony comes in the fifth week of the trial in which
   Disney shareholders contend that the board breached its fiduciary
   responsibility when it hired Mr. Ovitz, the former agent and co-founder
   of the Creative Artists Agency, as president in 1995 and then signed
   off 14 months later on his severance package, then valued at $140
   million.

   During Mr. Eisner's days on the stand, legal analysts expect him to try
   to justify both the hiring and firing of Mr. Ovitz. But he will need to
   walk a fine line, demonstrating that he did not merely hire Mr. Ovitz
   because he was a good friend and that while Mr. Ovitz's performance as
   president was flawed, it was not so egregious that he should have been
   fired for cause.

   On Monday, under questioning by his lawyer, Gary Naftalis, Mr. Eisner
   spent more than two hours describing the events that led to Mr. Ovitz's
   hiring. He said that he first met Mr. Ovitz when he was a young
   executive at the ABC network and Mr. Ovitz was an agent at William
   Morris, and the two became friendlier after Mr. Ovitz helped found
   Creative Artists, their families even vacationing together. "He was the
   most important person my age," Mr. Eisner said.

   Mr. Eisner also testified that he had tried to hire Mr. Ovitz several
   times, first to run the television division at Paramount Pictures in
   the early 1980's and then at Disney, which Mr. Eisner joined in 1984.

   After Frank G. Wells, Disney's former president and chief operating
   officer, died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Mr. Eisner approached Mr.
   Ovitz about that job during a plane ride to the Herb Allen conference
   of media and entertainment executives in Sun Valley, Idaho.

   "He was really impressive," said Mr. Eisner, referring to Mr. Ovitz's
   reputation as a top agent and his moves into other areas, including
   advertising.

   But Mr. Ovitz desired the title of co-chief executive of Disney, a
   notion Mr. Eisner rejected. Mr. Eisner recalled that as each of them
   were getting in their separate cars to drive to the conference, Mr.
   Ovitz yelled to Jane Eisner, Mr. Eisner's wife, "Tell him to do this
   because I'm going to save his life." Two days later, Mr. Eisner said,
   he had emergency bypass surgery.

   Negotiations became serious again in the spring of 1995, when Mr.
   Eisner said Mr. Ovitz told him that the Creative Artists Agency, by
   then a powerhouse in Hollywood, was discussing a transaction with Edgar
   Bronfman Jr. to join the television and film businesses of MCA Inc.,
   now part as NBC Universal. Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz asked Mr. Eisner
   to match his deal with Mr. Bronfman, and once again asked for the
   co-chief executive title. When Mr. Eisner said no, he said Mr. Ovitz
   "gave me a lecture on relationships."

   When the deal with Mr. Bronfman fell through, Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz
   was distraught. Mr. Eisner said, for his part, he saw an opportunity.
   Before the merger with ABC/Capital Cities announced in August 1995, Mr.
   Eisner said he told Mr. Ovitz about it to "whet his appetite." Within
   weeks of the merger's announcement, Mr. Ovitz agreed to become
   president of Disney.

   Mr. Eisner said he kept the board informed of those discussions. After
   Mr. Wells's death, Mr. Eisner said he discussed it with the investor
   Sid Bass, as well as with Roy E. Disney and Stanley P. Gold, who were
   board members at the time. Mr. Disney and Mr. Gold have since left the
   board and have campaigned to oust Mr. Eisner for the company's
   performance.

   But in his testimony on Monday morning, Mr. Disney said board members
   had not approved Mr. Ovitz's employment agreement before it was signed
   and were not given a breakdown of the value of the stock option plan.
   He added that he could not recall if board members were given
   comparable figures of executive pay at other companies.

   (Mr. Eisner said that Disney gave Mr. Ovitz five million stock options,
   two million of them dependent solely on Mr. Ovitz's renewing his
   contract. Mr. Eisner said Mr. Ovitz had originally asked for eight
   million stock options.)

   Mr. Disney said Mr. Eisner had no doubts about hiring Mr. Ovitz. But
   within the company, there was a degree of unhappiness that built over
   time, he said. There was trouble within the first few weeks of Mr.
   Ovitz's joining, Mr. Disney said. He recalled that Mr. Ovitz was about
   15 minutes late for a weekly staff luncheon attended by 25 to 30
   people. "Oh, don't worry, he's always late," Mr. Disney said a
   colleague told him at the time. After noticing that the conversation
   froze as Mr. Ovitz arrived and that several executives displayed
   negative "body language" during the meeting, Mr. Disney said he had the
   impression that there was tension in the executive suite.

   Mr. Ovitz said Mr. Disney, too, appeared uncomfortable at times, and
   was in particular reticent to wave at a crowd when the two were in a
   parade together in New Orleans.

Costco profits up 24% in 4th quarter

California workers'-compensation change cited

   Net profits for Costco Wholesale Corp. surged by 24 percent in its most
   recent quarter the company reported yesterday, boosted by changes in
   worker compensation rules in California.

   The Issaquah-based bulk retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of
   $296.8 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with a net profit of
   $239.4 million, or 51 cents a share, for the same period last year.

   The earning per share also exceeded analysts' estimates.

   Thomson Financial had surveyed analysts who had predicted an average
   earning of 58 cents per share.

   "That makes us happy," said Patty Edwards, managing director of the
   Seattle office of Wentworth, Hauser & Violich, which controls about
   800,000 shares of Costco stock.The company's fourth-quarter total
   revenue was $15.1 billion, up from $13.7 billion last year.

   In trading on the Nasdaq stock market yesterday, Costco shares closed
   at $44.65, up $1.72.

   Edwards partially attributed the "healthy and robust" earning per share
   number to changes in workers'-compensation rules in California and
   Costco employee health care coverage.

   At one time, she noted, an average claim for a worker in California
   could cost $76,000, and Costco has about a third of its store base in
   that state.

   She said the average claim for the same injury in other states is
   $22,000.

   She said California lawmakers changed the compensation regulations to
   lower the award amount.

   "With that change, they started to see better results," she said,
   referring to Costco.

   In 2003, Costco announced corporate decreases to its contributions for
   employee health care, which Edwards said once was close to 92 percent.

   The national average that companies pay, she said, hovers between 70
   percent and 75 percent.

   Membership fees also went up, to $306.4 million during the company's
   most recent fourth quarter. It was $272.9 million for the same period
   last year.

   Mitch Kaiser, a Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst in Minneapolis, said the
   company's offerings of gas, food courts and optometry products
   contributed to its good sales.

   "I think those ancillary businesses become a larger part of the mix,
   and they drive higher margins," he said.

   Kaiser added that Costco focuses on higher-income customers -- a
   strategy that helps when going up against competitor Wal-Mart Stores
   Inc., which runs Sam's Club, a warehouse store.

   Customers in high-income brackets, Kaiser said, might not be as
   adversely affected by rising gasoline costs or unemployment.

   For the full fiscal year, Costco earned $882 million, or $1.85 a share,
   on $48.1 billion in revenue -- up from $721 million, or $1.53 a share,
   on revenue of $42.5 billion a year ago.

   Its year-end total revenue was $48.1 billion, up from $42.6 billion
   last year.

   In this fiscal year, which started in September, the company hopes to
   open up to 30 more stores, a Costco spokesman said.

   The company operates 442 warehouse stores with 327 in the United
   States.

   The remaining ones are in Canada, Britain, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan
   and Mexico.

Cellphones on planes: travelers’ next hang-up?

   WASHINGTON — Airline passengers already are beginning to brace for the
   possible introduction of cellphones on commercial flights. Listen to
   Richard Archambault, an architect from Schaumburg, Ill., who wants to
   plug his ears against the expected yelling into balky receivers.

   “People who don’t hesitate to talk in restaurants or other taboo venues
   will take their disrespectful attitudes with them to the skies and turn
   a once-quiet place of refuge into a noisy, officelike environment to
   the detriment of all,” Archambault said. “Overuse of the devices, loud
   talkers and self-important businessmen who get a kick from showing off
   their power will turn our airplane cabins into intolerable
   chatterboxes, further removing, and perhaps eliminating, all the
   remaining vestiges of civility in air travel.”

       Haggen plans broad retreat from costly expansion, filing shows

   Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.

   The new wave of complaints comes as the Federal Communications
   Commission (FCC) begins a review of its 20-year-old rule prohibiting
   cellphone chatter at 30,000 feet. The commission will seek to determine
   whether recent advances in technology relieve earlier concerns about
   the use of cellphones aboard airlines.

   The FCC also will solicit passengers’ opinions. Travelers can voice
   their views through the agency’s Web site, www.fcc.gov. Information can
   be found on the site under “Filing Public Comments.”

   Still, travelers’ worst fears of nonstop transcontinental chatter won’t
   be realized soon. Both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA) would have to approve the use of cellphones in airline cabins. If
   the FCC rules in favor of a change, the FAA still isn’t likely to
   seriously begin grappling with the question until 2006, pending results
   of its own studies.

   For its part, the FAA has banned cellphone use aboard commercial
   flights because of concern that the transmissions could interfere with
   aircraft navigational equipment. The agency has commissioned a report
   by the nonprofit RTCA, formerly the Radio Technical Commission for
   Aeronautics, to examine the issue. So far, the FAA has not proved
   conclusively that cellphones interfere with navigation. But the agency
   has long preferred to err on the side of caution.

   “The problem is there is no data or evidence that cellphones do or do
   not cause a problem,” FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said.

   In its review, the FCC will address whether cellphones used on
   airliners are a problem for communications on the ground. An FCC study
   in 2000 found that dropped or blocked calls on the ground increased
   because passengers overhead were talking on their cellphones. Cellular
   signals coming from high altitudes are spread across several base
   stations, interfering with callers on the ground who are using the same
   frequencies.

   The FCC also is expected to study ways to introduce more price
   competition among companies that offer telephone and high-speed
   Internet services from the sky.

   The current cellphone ban requires passengers to turn off the devices
   when the plane’s door is closed for takeoff. Some airlines allow
   travelers to make calls after a flight has landed and is moving toward
   a gate.

   Airlines, aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and telecommunication
   companies such as Verizon have lobbied hard on the issue. Several
   carriers, recognizing that business travelers crave to remain
   connected, have won approval from the FAA and FCC to test how
   cellphones affect their own aircraft systems. American Airlines and
   Qualcomm conducted tests in the summer.

   With cellphone use proliferating, Amtrak designated phone-free cars in
   early 2001 on many trains along the Northeast corridor after a flood of
   complaints from passengers.

   Frequent traveler John Dohmen, who is based in Vienna, Va., said he
   supports instant wireless messaging and e-mail on airplanes but not
   cellphone use. “Can’t you just hear it now?” he asked. “Ten conference
   calls going on with passengers and their offices, each participant
   trying to talk louder than the next passenger because they just
   normally talk louder on a cellphone, and a number are trying to impress
   the rest of the plane with how important they are.”

   Martha Stewart gets her federal inmate number
   NEW YORK (AP) — Martha Stewart still does not know where she will do
   her time for lying about a stock sale, but she's already been
   designated federal inmate No. 55170-054.

   The celebrity homemaker, who must begin serving her five-month prison
   sentence by Oct. 8, was assigned the number by federal marshals.

   The number now appears under Stewart's name on the U.S. Bureau of
   Prisons Web site. She is also listed as "in transit," but the
   designation simply means she has a reporting date, prisons spokesman
   Dan Dunne said Monday.

   Officials still must decide where Stewart will serve her time. She has
   asked to be assigned to the minimum-security federal prison in Danbury,
   Conn., to make it easier for her 90-year-old mother to visit.

   The bureau had not notified Stewart of a prison assignment Monday, said
   Martin Weinberg, one of her appeals lawyers.

   Stewart and stockbroker Peter Bacanovic were convicted of lying about
   why she sold ImClone Systems Inc. stock in 2001. Both are appealing,
   but Stewart has said she will report to prison anyway to put the
   "nightmare" behind her.

   After the five months in prison, Stewart will serve five months under
   house arrest at her estate in Bedford, N.Y.

   Shares in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. fell 10%, or $1.73, in
   afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back some of
   the strong gains it made after Stewart announced that she wanted to
   begin her sentence.

   [t.gif] New, more colorful $50 bill begins circulating with $10 bill
   next
   [black.gif]

   By Jeannine Aversa
   ASSOCIATED PRESS

   7:47 a.m. September 28, 2004

                                                         [040928fifty.jpg]

       The newly redesigned $50 note is displayed in Union Station Tuesday
         after a ceremony marking the distribution of the new notes by the
         Federal Reserve System to banks and thus into the public's hands.

   WASHINGTON – Coming to cash registers near you: Colorful new $50 bills
   sporting splashes of red, blue and yellow. Next up for a makeover, the
   government said Tuesday: $10 bills.

   That would bring to three the number of greenbacks to undergo the color
   treatment in an effort to thwart counterfeiters.

   The new $10 is expected to be unveiled this spring and put into
   circulation in fall 2005, Thomas Ferguson, director of the Bureau of
   Engraving and Printing, said in an interview.

   Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first treasury secretary, is expected
   to stay on the front of the new $10 with the Treasury Department on the
   back, officials said. Various efforts have emerged to put former
   President Ronald Reagan on the nation's currency, either on the $10
   bill or the $20 bill, or possibly the dime.

   The new $50s went into circulation on Tuesday and soon will be showing
   up at banks, cash registers and wallets. Ferguson said that 140 million
   of the new $50s have been printed.

   Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general and 18th president, remains on
   the front and the U.S. Capitol remains on the back of the new bills.
   But subtle colors have been added – joining the traditional black ink
   on the fronts and green ink on the backs. The design for the new $50s
   was unveiled in April.

   Old $50 bills will continue to be accepted and recirculated until they
   wear out.

   After the $10 makeover comes the $100 bill, the most counterfeited note
   outside the United States, Ferguson said. The $5 bill won't get a new
   look, neither will the $1 and $2 notes, he said.

   Colors for the redesigned notes vary by denomination. Ferguson didn't
   say what the colors would be for a new $10 and a new $100.

   A new $100 note was supposed to follow the new $50 but that changed
   because the bureau is considering additional security features for the
   $100 bill. A timetable for a new $100 bill introduction hasn't been
   set.

   Security features include an embedded thread that glows yellow when
   exposed to an ultraviolet light; ink that changes color – from copper
   to green – when the note is tilted; watermarks visible when held up to
   light; and hard-to-replicate microprinting. In one spot, the tiny words
   "United States of America" appear on Grant's collar, under his beard.

   Old $50 bills will continue to be accepted and recirculated until they
   wear out.

   The $20 bill, the most counterfeited note in the United States, was the
   first to get extra color. Featuring touches of peach, blue and yellow,
   the new $20 went into circulation last fall. The colorizing project is
   part of a larger makeover of U.S. currency aimed at thwarting
   counterfeiters.

   The government has launched an extensive campaign to help people,
   especially those who handle cash frequently in their jobs such as
   merchants and bank tellers, to be able to spot genuine versus bogus
   bills.

   Moreover, the government has worked with industry to make appropriate
   changes so that various machines, including vending machines, fare-card
   machines, self-checkout equipment used by some grocery and home-supply
   stores, will accept the new notes.

   United's plan for profit looks abroad
   By Marilyn Adams, USA TODAY
   United Airlines said Wednesday that it plans to exit bankruptcy court
   as a smaller airline but with the largest international service of any
   U.S. carrier.

   United has been in bankruptcy reorganization 22 months and is still
   posting losses. The airline plans to expand international flying
   capacity 14% and shrink domestic capacity 12% by next year, without
   dropping service to any cities.

   United and Northwest Airlines are roughly equal in their international
   business and lead the industry.

   International routes have little or no discount competition and are
   more profitable than domestic routes. In the USA, United confronts
   Southwest Airlines, Frontier Airways, Independence Air and other
   low-cost carriers.

   In an interview, United executive John Tague said that relentlessly
   high fuel prices, growing competition from discount airlines and
   stagnant fares prompted the decision to shrink the domestic system.

   In its plan to become profitable, United would reduce its main jet
   fleet to 455 jets from 523. Rather than drop service to U.S. cities,
   United will use smaller jets, shift flights to regional carriers or
   offer fewer daily flights. Tague said executives can't justify keeping
   so many planes on unprofitable domestic routes.

   By the end of 2005, United expects to derive 55% of revenue from
   international flights to Europe, Asia and South America, up from 46%
   now.

   Washington-based aviation consultant Jon Ash said expanding
   internationally makes sense for United, which already has a strong
   route system to three continents on which it can charge premium fares.
   Most international growth would come in Asia, where United is doubling
   its flying to China, expanding service in Japan and gearing up for
   Vietnam.

   The shift to international flights and the planned fleet reduction is
   the biggest piece of United's business plan announced to date.

   United needs to complete a revised business plan before getting
   commitments for financing to exit bankruptcy protection.

   The No. 2 airline said it will implement changes between now and March.
   Chicago-based United hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection by next
   June.

   But much remains to be done before United can exit bankruptcy court,
   including reducing its pension obligations.

   It has said it probably will terminate its costly employee pension
   plans and replace them with less expensive plans. But none of the
   carrier's four employee unions says it has received pension proposals
   or held formal talks.

   Upset with how the company is being run, the International Association
   of Machinists, United's biggest union, has asked the bankruptcy court
   to remove United's management team and appoint a trustee to run the
   company. A hearing is scheduled Oct. 27.

   In a letter this week, pilots union Chairman Mark Bathurst told members
   the union won't accept a replacement plan that isn't structured to
   recognize that pilots have the most to lose if their plan is
   terminated.

   Maxima, Escalade tops with thieves
   By Earle Eldridge, USA TODAY
   The Nissan Maxima's fancy headlights have made it such a target for
   thieves that Maxima's rate of insurance theft claims has gone from
   inconsequential to second-highest among all vehicles, according to a
   report out Tuesday.
   [clear.gif]
   [inside2-stolen.jpg] [clear.gif] 2002 Escalade EXT tops the list.
   [clear.gif]
                                    General Motors

   Cadillac's Escalade EXT has the highest rate of theft claims,
   apparently because many have expensive wheels, according to the report.
   It's the second consecutive year that an Escalade has had the highest
   claims rate. (VIDEO: Cars with highest and lowest theft rates..)

   The theft claim rate is the number of theft-related insurance claims
   per 1,000 insured vehicles. Insurers pay theft-related claims on 20.2
   of every 1,000 Escalades and 17 of every 1,000 Maximas.

   Maxima's high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, the icy-blue lights
   sometimes called xenon lights, are considered a status symbol because
   HID lights are usually found on luxury or high-performance cars. Nissan
   made HID lights standard on 2002 Maximas to give them an extra selling
   point against rivals.

   The lights can be installed on older models, and the HID bulbs can be
   removed from the light assemblies and used in other vehicles.

   The problem's so bad that Nissan sent owners a letter telling them that
   dealers will install free brackets "to make the headlights more
   difficult to steal," says Nissan spokesman Kyle Bazemore.

   Most light thefts take place in the Northeast, so Nissan has supplied
   New York and New Jersey police with decoys to lure and trap thieves,
   Bazemore says.

   Sometimes the whole car is stolen, apparently just for the lights
   because those are all that's missing when the cars are found. Other
   times, only the lights are taken. Either way, it generates a theft
   claim, according to the report from the Highway Loss Data Institute.

   HLDI is an affiliate of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,
   funded by auto insurers. IIHS is best known for its crash tests.

   The Escalade and Maxima theft-claim rates are seven to eight times the
   average for all vehicles.

   The Escalade, a luxury pickup priced at $50,000 and more, suffers from
   its popularity. Well liked by professional athletes and entertainers,
   it often is customized with thousands of dollars' worth of oversized
   wheels and high-output sound systems.

   "Stolen Escalades are sometimes found resting on blocks without their
   wheels," says Kim Hazelbaker, HLDI senior vice president. Thieves pass
   over the truck and its other goodies to get the wheels because they are
   so easy to sell.

   The Escalade's anti-theft system is an early version that might be less
   effective than newer versions, Hazelbaker says.

   Cadillac officials say they plan to install an upgraded system in
   future Escalades.

   "While we regret any vehicle being stolen, this is clear evidence that
   the Cadillac Escalade is in high demand," says Kelly Wysocki, a
   Cadillac spokeswoman.

   "Thieves follow market trends and target the most-popular vehicles
   because they offer the best market for stolen vehicle parts and illegal
   export to other countries," she says.

   Vehicles with the lowest rate of theft claims are the Buick LeSabre,
   Buick Park Avenue and the Ford Taurus station wagon.

   Overall theft claims declined to an average 2.5 per 1,000 insured
   vehicles last year from about 15.5 per 1,000 vehicles in 1980.

   Ovitz testifies Eisner didn't back him up
   By David Lieberman, USA TODAY
   GEORGETOWN, Del. — It has taken eight years, but former Disney
   president Michael Ovitz finally got his day in court here Tuesday.
   [clear.gif]

   ready to testify in a lawsuit stemming from his brief tenure as
   president. [clear.gif]
   Chris Gardner, AP

   He used it to forcefully assert that CEO Michael Eisner's repeated
   failure to make sound business judgments and deal squarely with people
   — not Ovitz's incompetence — led to the former agent's downfall in 1996
   after just 14 months at the Magic Kingdom.

   "They're not particularly sensitive to human beings" at Disney, says
   Ovitz, once considered the most powerful man in Hollywood.

   Ovitz gave the glitterati plenty of fresh details to feast on about the
   behind-the-scenes power plays that marked the entertainment business in
   the go-go mid-1990s.

   But his effort to rehabilitate his reputation in Chancery Court here
   also is key to a potentially precedent-setting case.

   Lawyers for Disney shareholders want Chancellor William Chandler III to
   rule that the Disney board abused its right to make business decisions
   by failing to properly scrutinize Eisner's deal to make Ovitz, who had
   never run a public company, the No. 2. They allegedly compounded the
   error by rubber-stamping a "no-fault termination" that let him to walk
   away with $140 million in cash and stock.

   The opening witness for the defense, Ovitz said he and Eisner had
   talked "ad nauseam" about the ramifications of the hiring. "We didn't
   pull any punches with each other," he testified. "He said, 'We're going
   to be the bosses, and it will all fall into place.' I said, 'I have
   never run a public company.' And I said to him, 'I need a year of
   education. You have to teach me what to do.' ... I trusted him 1,000%."

   Instead, Ovitz says, Eisner didn't back his No. 2 up when other
   executives, including former general counsel Sanford Litvack and CFO
   Stephen Bollenbach, said they wouldn't report to him.

   Later, Ovitz says, Eisner scuttled his initiatives to grow Disney's
   Hollywood Records by buying EMI or signing deals with stars such as
   Janet Jackson. Then he turned down a rare chance to buy a big block of
   shares in Yahoo that could have improved Internet operations.

   Eisner also allegedly nixed proposals to reinvigorate Disney's radio,
   video game and book-publishing operations.

   Ovitz says Eisner also failed to support his efforts to resolve a
   contract fight with ex-studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, improve ABC's
   program development, expand into Asia and repair Disney's tattered
   relationships with stars including Home Improvement's Tim Allen, who
   once walked off the set. "Disney was a company that had made it without
   any talent relations," he says. "It was a difficult place. ... I felt I
   could soften that image."

   Ovitz returns to the stand today.

   Stun guns OK'd for use on airline
   By Alan Levin and Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY
   WASHINGTON — Korean Air last week became the first carrier to receive
   U.S. government permission to equip jets with electric stun guns as a
   defense against terrorists.

   Korean, which had installed TASER guns on at least some of its fleet in
   2002, can now use these weapons on flights over this country, the
   Transportation Security Administration told USA TODAY.

   TASERs are designed to deliver an electric shock that briefly
   incapacitates people without injuring them. Last year the TSA decided
   that stun guns were the only non-lethal weapon that could be used
   safely on airline flights.

   "TSA believes that less-than-lethal weapons, if properly deployed,
   offer a positive additional layer of security," says spokesman Mark
   Hatfield.

   Spokesmen with TASER International and TSA decline to say whether
   pilots, flight attendants or both had been trained to use the stun
   guns. Korean has 50 flights a week into this country.

   The TSA doesn't expect large numbers of airlines to follow Korean's
   lead. "There's no indication that there's a large movement in this
   direction at this time," Hatfield says. "But we'll give serious
   consideration of every application we get."

   United Airlines, which bought 1,300 TASERs, had planned to install two
   of the devices in the cockpit of each of its jets. But it put the
   program on hold after declaring bankruptcy in December 2002.

   Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, many
   groups, including the Association of Flight Attendants, called for stun
   guns. In some cases, they pushed them because they opposed arming
   pilots with handguns.

   United and TASER conducted studies to ensure that the device's electric
   shock would not damage a jet's complex electronics. Technicians fired
   TASERs at cockpit instruments hundreds of times before the TSA agreed
   that they were safe.

   But installing TASERs in airplanes lost momentum after Congress decided
   that specially trained pilots should be armed with handguns and as
   other new security measures were adopted. Airlines also began to suffer
   financial losses.

   Capt. Hank Krakowski, United's vice president for safety and security,
   says the airline would still like to install the TASERs it bought.

   But it feels less urgency to do it now with hardened cockpit doors, a
   rejuvenated Federal Air Marshal program and growing ranks of pilots
   trained to carry handguns. United also is installing wire barriers
   outside cockpit doors to make it even harder for intruders to enter.

   Use of TASERs remains controversial. Capt. Stephen Luckey, security
   chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association, says that stun guns should
   be confined to the main cabin and used only by flight attendants.
   Luckey's group thinks that the weapons are less effective in the
   cockpit.

   However, Tom Smith, president of TASER International, says the weapons
   could be effective in the cockpit. TASER helped devise a training
   program for pilots.

   Job stress beginning to take toll on some airline workers
   By Barbara De Lollis, USA TODAY
   Workers at major airlines are showing signs of strain from salary and
   benefit cuts, threats to their pensions, demotions, layoffs and bigger
   workloads. And travelers are starting to pay.

   By Gene J. Puskar, AP

   In the past month, the FBI launched an investigation into whether
   employees punctured US Airways jets. Strike talk spread among flight
   attendants at United, US Airways and other carriers. And unusually high
   numbers of workers sought counseling services.

   Psychologists and management experts say a demoralized workforce
   anxious about their pay, personal lives and job safety doesn't bode
   well for passengers during the busy holiday travel season. That's
   especially true this season, as airlines carry a record number of
   passengers and lines at security checkpoints lengthen because of
   tougher requirements.

   Stressed-out employees and irritated passengers "create a time bomb for
   explosive interaction," says Richard Chaifetz, CEO of ComPsych, an
   employee assistance provider. As of September, ComPsych received about
   20% more calls than last year from baggage handlers, flight attendants,
   pilots and other major airline workers. The uptick — even greater at
   more-troubled carriers — indicates higher levels of stress, unhappiness
   and uncertainty, he says.

   Even though fliers have come to expect less from their major-airline
   flight experience since the Sept. 11 attacks, research shows they've
   noticed a difference this year.

   Their No. 1 gripe? Less-courteous flight crews, says Jonathan Barsky of
   Market Metrix Hospitality Index.

   The index, based on surveys of 35,000 fliers, shows satisfaction
   falling since January, after reaching a two-year high. Similarly, the
   University of Michigan's American Customer Satisfaction Index shows
   that satisfaction with major carriers fell this year after rising last
   year.

   "Customer satisfaction and financial performance tend to go hand in
   hand," Barsky says.

   The airlines know that and are trying to counter the intense resentment
   felt by some employees, many of whom have worked 15 or more years for a
   carrier. Those people, in particular, feel overworked, underpaid,
   underappreciated and uncertain about their futures, Chaifetz says.

   The USA's six big traditional carriers will lose an estimated $8
   billion this year — more than the $5 billion previously projected — in
   part because of low-fare competition and record-high jet fuel prices.
   This month, Continental became the last of the six airlines to seek
   labor givebacks. The other carriers in the group — American (AMR),
   United, Delta (DAL), Northwest (NWAC) and US Airways — might not be
   finished squeezing employees yet.

   "You have carriers still in bankruptcy and in precarious financial
   situations," says airline consultant Dave Emerson of Bain & Co.
   "There's no guarantee there won't be more pay cuts and layoffs going
   forward."

   Morale's costs

   While the bad news continues, some carriers are revamping employee
   incentive programs and trying to improve communication with workers.

   There's little dispute that employee morale is "hugely important," says
   Lee Macenczak, Delta's senior vice president of customer service.

   "While self-service has grown in popularity, at the end of the day, it
   is about dealing with people ... and morale definitely plays into
   that," Macenczak says.

   Poor morale has risks. It:

   •Hurts productivity. Some employees might not work as hard at a time
   when 110% effort is needed to diminish airlines' financial losses. The
   big airlines are handling about the same number of passengers as they
   did four years ago when they had as many as 40% more employees.
   Seriously troubled companies sometimes see a short-term boost in
   productivity as employees try harder, says Claes Fornell, director of
   the American Customer Satisfaction Index. But it fades as their sense
   of determination turns to hopelessness.

   •Drives passengers away. "People don't feel good about flying an
   airline where the employees don't feel good about working for them,"
   says ComPsych's Chaifetz. Employee attitudes become more important as
   the airlines extend low fares to compete directly with the discounters.
   When fares are similar, "I'll fly the one I feel I get the better
   experience on," says consultant Tom Knighton of Forum Corp., a
   Boston-based firm that trains managers and employees how to improve
   customer service.

   Knighton points to Gallup research that shows that when an airline
   employee "stands out" in a positive way, a flier is 15 times more
   likely to fly the same carrier.

   •Hampers turnaround efforts. Whether inside headquarters or the hangar,
   these airlines need employees to give their all, says Kevin Mitchell of
   the Business Travel Coalition. Bad attitudes hurt efforts to improve
   customer service, which is critical to survival, he says.

   Frequent flier Gary Lockhart overheard ticket agents discussing pay
   cuts, layoffs and low morale as he waited to board a US Airways flight
   from New York LaGuardia to Pittsburgh earlier this year. Right then, he
   vowed to switch carriers.

   "I wondered if the pilots felt the same way. ... Not exactly a
   comforting thought," Lockhart says. "Since then, I fly US Air as little
   as possible."

   Michael Steiner, president of New York-based Ovation Corporate Travel,
   says his business clients are happy with some changes the airlines have
   made, such as offering more self-service kiosks. But they complain
   about "the loss of the personal touch."

   Delta frequent flier Karen Lamphier dislikes flying mostly because of
   the security. But Delta's staff makes it bearable, she says, citing a
   recent case of when the VIP lounge staff went out of their way to help
   during a flight delay.

   "The people still make the difference," says the software consultant
   from Eden, Utah.

   Airline employees say that they will continue to do their jobs well,
   regardless of pay and benefit cuts.

   "I don't think that any of the flight crews are taking it out on the
   passengers," says US Airways flight attendant John McCorkle. "They
   recognize that the customers are just innocent bystanders caught in the
   middle."

   Discounters shine

   Statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation show that from
   January to September, discounters Southwest and JetBlue received among
   the fewest complaints per 100,000 passengers of 19 airlines ranked.
   They placed second and third, behind ExpressJet Airlines, a regional
   carrier that operates Continental Express flights. All the big six
   carriers placed in the bottom half of the list, with United and US
   Airways placing 15th and 16th. Results were similar for the same period
   last year.

   Most passengers might not directly feel employees' frustration unless
   they overhear grousing in the galley or at the boarding gate, or talk
   to employees. But it is rippling into the workplace:

   • A small number of United mechanics not typically seen by the public
   regularly sport caps with two large letters — "F" and "U" — and, in
   small print, "Fly United."

   • This month, leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants — the
   USA's biggest flight attendant union — called for an industrywide
   strike if US Airways, or any other carrier, succeeds in rescinding
   labor contracts in bankruptcy court. Flight attendants at several
   airlines, including US Airways and United, are voting on strike
   authority. Flight attendants at American, the world's largest airline,
   and Southwest say they support the vote.

   • The FBI is investigating whether US Airways employees last month
   punched small holes in the belly of three jets in Charlotte and
   Orlando. The damage, described as minor exterior damage, was discovered
   during routine maintenance checks last month, shortly before a
   bankruptcy court approved 21% temporary pay cuts. The union that
   represents mechanics and related employees called it "reckless and
   irresponsible" to speculate on what caused the damage.

   • Earlier this month, US Airways had two instances of higher-than-usual
   sick calls in Philadelphia. The sick calls, along with baggage belt and
   computer problems, resulted in some flight delays and cancellations,
   says spokesman David Castelveter. Also in Philadelphia, passengers last
   month heard a voice on the speaker system say that, because of 21%
   temporary pay cuts, baggage would arrive up to an hour and a half late,
   according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

   Incentives at work

   As workers try to adjust to the new reality, the major airlines are
   trying to soften the blow for their remaining workers.

   Some, such as American, United and Delta, are creating programs to
   reward employees for superior performance. Most are also introducing
   profit-sharing programs. United says its incentive program is already
   working. The carrier has met its goals as measured by on-time
   performance and customer intent to fly United again in each of the past
   three quarters, and has paid out bonuses, says United spokeswoman Jean
   Medina.

   But until the airlines turn losses into profits, employees can't count
   on profit sharing for bigger paychecks.

   US Airways is widely considered to have the worst morale problem of its
   peers. It has gone to its union-represented employees for two rounds of
   concessions and is negotiating a third round now with mechanics, flight
   attendants and customer-service agents. If deals aren't reached, it
   will begin making its case Thursday in bankruptcy court to void the
   contracts.

   To prevent sick calls during the hectic holiday period, CEO Bruce
   Lakefield said, the airline reinstated an incentive program that it can
   afford. Employees with perfect attendance through early January, and
   those who work peak days, will earn US Airways tickets and the chance
   to enter a lottery for freebies donated by vendors, such as game
   tickets for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles and NBA's Charlotte Bobcats,
   he says.

   "We'd like to get all this behind us," Lakefield says. "When people
   have futures, they feel much better about morale and their personal
   lives."

   Grouse unlikely to find shelter on endangered list
   By Tom Kenworthy, USA TODAY
   DENVER — A bird at the center of a controversy that impacts the
   nation's multibillion-dollar energy industry should not be included on
   the endangered species list, a panel of federal wildlife officials has
   concluded.
   [clear.gif]

   least a quarter of all sagebrush habitat. [clear.gif]
   AP

   An endangered listing for the greater sage grouse, whose habitat
   overlaps with the West's prime gas drilling territory, has been
   contested by energy advocates who fear that federal protections on the
   bird's nesting areas will disrupt the Bush administration's plan for a
   gas industry boom.

   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Steve Williams said Thursday
   that he will tell Western governors meeting today in San Diego that
   scientists and his agency's experts believe the sage grouse faces "a
   very low risk of extinction" and is "unlikely to become endangered in
   the foreseeable future." Williams will review the recommendation and
   make a final decision by the end of the year.

   Though estimates of the grouse's numbers are imprecise, federal
   biologists say the bird has declined from 2 million-3 million at the
   time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the dawn of the 19th century
   to 140,000-500,000 today.

   Interior Secretary Gale Norton said in June that the economic effects
   of a grouse listing would dwarf the impacts felt by the Pacific
   Northwest timber industry during the 1990s after efforts to protect the
   northern spotted owl. A sage grouse listing would also impact ranching,
   farming, off-road vehicle use and other activities.

   Much of the grouse's decline is due to the destruction of sagebrush
   habitat in the West. Sagebrush once covered about 300 million acres, an
   area almost twice as large as Texas. But about half of that has been
   changed by livestock grazing, fire, non-native plants, housing
   developments, roads and energy exploration.

   A large ground-dwelling bird, the sage grouse is found at elevations of
   4,000-9,000 feet and is dependent on sagebrush for shelter, food and
   protection from predators.

   The Fish and Wildlife Service began reviewing the size and extent of
   greater sage grouse populations in April as a result of three petitions
   by nine conservation organizations to add the bird to the endangered
   species list. Under the Endangered Species Act, the service must review
   those petitions and decide whether a full review is warranted. A
   full-blown review normally takes about a year and can result in a
   decision to list, to not list or list a species as "warranted but
   precluded" by more urgent priorities.

   Upon learning of the agency's recommendation, Mark Salvo, an
   Arizona-based conservationist who filed one of the listing petitions,
   said in a written statement, "The only science upon which the Bush
   administration based this decision was political science. They are
   paying back their political base in the grazing and oil and gas
   industries."

   The Gunnison sage grouse, a separate species that lives in southwest
   Colorado and southeast Utah, is a candidate for placement on the
   endangered species list.

   Salvation Army to accept credit-card donations
   PHOENIX (AP) — The clang of coins in the Salvation Army's red kettles
   is being accompanied by the swwwwwipe of credit and debit cards this
   year as the charity equips some bell ringers to accept plastic.

   switch will boost donations this year. [clear.gif]
   By Matt York, AP

   Officials in Phoenix, which made the switch Wednesday, hope it will
   attract new donors and help offset an expected decrease in donations
   after Target stores nationally banned bell ringers.

   "So many people shop with a debit card now. They just don't have cash,
   or extra change," said Sandi Gabel, a Salvation Army spokeswoman in
   Arizona. "It will be a nice way for people to make a donation if they
   don't have that cash on hand."

   Salvation Army kettles have been a holiday institution since 1891. The
   donations fund a range of services, including medical assistance,
   emergency services and food and clothing for the needy.

   About $1 million was raised from kettle donations in Arizona last year.
   "We knew we were going to have a loss this year in our kettle income,
   so we were looking for ideas, things to do to spark the interest of the
   public and our donors," Gabel said.

   Bell ringers tried card swipes at least once before, in 1997 in
   Pittsburgh, but the idea did not prove popular.

   "There's a whole psychology to it," said Ginny Knor, a spokeswoman for
   the Western Pennsylvania Division of the Salvation Army. "People would
   come over and look at it, then put their change in the kettle."

   Donors in Phoenix showed the same response Wednesday, emptying the
   change from their pockets rather than swiping a card.

   "I would actually go out of my way to get cash and then drop it back
   off," said Joe Posadas, 23, of Phoenix.

   But college student Heather Farber, 21, said she'd rather use plastic.
   "I never have cash," Farber said. "And I feel cheap just throwing in a
   few quarters."

   The card swipe machines are wireless and produce paper receipts for tax
   purposes. Gabel said to ensure security, bell ringers will be dressed
   in Salvation Army uniforms when the card swipe machines are in use.
   "They will be people you'd feel safe running your card," she said.

   Angry that the Salvation Army might lose nearly $200,000 in donations
   collected in red kettles outside Target department stores in Washington
   state, customers have latched onto Internet-fueled boycott campaigns,
   written stinging letters and vowed to take their business elsewhere.

   The aftershock from Target's decision to ban the Christian
   organization's bell ringers this Christmas season is being felt from
   downtown Seattle to the two-block business district of Chelan, from
   miffed shoppers to rival retailers.

   "Last year, I spent over $2,000 for Christmas in Target," said Don
   Emanuel of Kent. "This year, I will not spend a dime."

   Other chains have taken heed of the controversial end of the tradition
   at Target's 1,313 department stores nationwide, including 31 in
   Washington, and made moves to welcome the Salvation Army.

   Mervyn's, the department store chain sold by Target in September, last
   week made the Salvation Army an exception to a no-solicitation policy
   at its 257 stores, 14 of them Washington.

   And Albertsons, which previously allowed district administrators to
   decide whether to allow the bell ringers, has given blanket approval
   for its nearly 2,500 supermarkets, including 85 in the state.

   Though the corporations say their changed policies were motivated by
   wanting to help the Salvation Army, they also are aware of the
   backlash, which started before Thanksgiving and hasn't cooled.

   "It's humbling for us, a clear signal of how much the public respects
   us and the trust they put into us," said Maj. George Hood, the
   Salvation Army's national spokesman in Alexandria, Va.

   "The bell ringers and kettles are iconic. They're part of the American
   Christmas. To think they're under threat -- the public is not accepting
   it."

   Andrea Clay of Kenmore is one of dozens of Target customers from across
   the country who contacted the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after reading
   a recent story about the ban on the red kettles.

   "The bell ringers are part of a holiday tradition," she said. "I look
   forward to hearing 'Merry Christmas' from them as I drop my spare
   change into their container. ... They have always been genuinely merry,
   even if I didn't leave them a donation."

   Clay said she normally would spend between $100 and $200 a month at
   Target, but now has taken to shopping elsewhere.

   Doug Coulter, who lives in upstate New York, said he "told everyone if
   they buy me any presents at Target, to also put the receipt in the box
   'cause I'll be returning them."

   Bantarget.org, one of several anti-Target Web sites, has received more
   than 6,000 hits, including 75 from Washington, said organizer Jon
   Chitwood of Overland Park, Kan.

   Target corporate spokeswoman Paula Greear declined to comment on how
   the controversy is affecting its holiday sales.

   She said her company included the Salvation Army in its no-solicitation
   policy to be fair and consistent with other groups that wish to raise
   money outside its stores.

   For the past decade, the Salvation Army was the lone exception to the
   chain's ban on solicitors. The organization raised nearly $9 million
   nationwide at Target stores last year, its most ever.

   Of that, nearly $200,000 was raised in Washington.

   Target informed the Salvation Army in January that it would no longer
   allow the bell ringers, but "it's not the end of the relationship,"
   Greear stressed. "Our commitment remains strong."

   She said Target has invited the Salvation Army and other non-profit
   groups to apply for grants, noting that the company donates $2 million
   a week nationally to community, school, art and other organizations.

   That doesn't matter to some customers.

   "While I do respect the track record of Target (in) previously allowing
   the bell ringers, it does not negate their current unfair policy," said
   Tim Wilson of Seattle, who had been shopping twice a month at Target.

   Bremerton resident Tim Shawgo said he had made most of his Christmas
   purchases at Target the past two years.

   But he'll stay away out of a greater allegiance to the Salvation Army,
   an organization that Shawgo said acts on its Christian beliefs to "give
   to those in need of assistance and help, no matter what the recipients'
   beliefs or background. They deserve personal, public and corporate
   support for the work they do in our communities."

   Money raised through the kettles goes to help the needy, providing
   meals and groceries, toys for children and help with utility bills.

   While grateful for expressions of support, the Salvation Army does not
   advocate punishing Target, said Aimee Sheridan, director of development
   for the organization's Northwest Division, which includes Washington.

   A better way to help the Salvation Army is by donating toys -- which is
   what QFC and Fred Meyer stores are doing, among other businesses or
   organizations -- or volunteering to be bell ringers, she said.

   In Chelan in Central Washington, 45 miles from the Target store in
   Wenatchee, business people are volunteering to staff the kettles every
   Friday and Saturday until Christmas, said Ray Dobbs, who runs a
   RadioShack store and organized the effort in response to Target's
   change of policy.

   So far, 216 people have signed up for shifts covering Chelan's
   two-block business district.

   The first weekend raised $1,000, so much that workers used ballpoint
   pens to jam money through the slots of the crammed kettles, Dobbs said.

   Several Target customers, including Clay and Wilson, said they use the
   red kettles as a lesson in giving for their children.

   "It has always been a wonderful way to teach our children that there
   are less fortunate people," said Sue Wise of Medford, Ore., describing
   her family as "die-hard Target shoppers (who) will not shop there this
   year."

   While most of those voicing their opinions on the issue support the
   Salvation Army, Seattle customer Karin Youngberg is an exception.

   "I applaud Target's decision," she said. "I don't give to the kettles
   and I think they are an annoyance.

   "We do give about 10 percent of our income to various groups ... but I
   prefer to have my giving planned and not be hit up every time I go to
   the grocery store, the hardware store, Fred Meyer or Starbucks."

   The Salvation Army does not yet know how it is faring nationally with
   fund raising, since each community won't be reporting its totals until
   January.

   Based on what he's heard so far, most locales seem to be equaling the
   money collected last year, said Hood, the national spokesman.

   He acknowledged that the hubbub has helped publicize the needs of the
   Salvation Army.

   "That's the forewarning that I gave to Target , that (the public) would
   come after them with a vengeance," Hood said. "But I don't think anyone
   in their wildest imagination expected this. It's not letting up."

   While Target tries to ride out the storm, it might have to ramp up its
   public relations efforts, according to Joseph Brown, an ex-customer
   from St. Louis.

   "Granted, Target may give thousands, even millions, to charities," he
   said. "But public image is everything."

United Warns It May Jettison Pension Plans to Stay Afloat

By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

Published: August 20, 2004

   United Airlines said yesterday that it would most likely terminate its
   four employee pension plans and replace them with less generous
   benefits, a drastic move that United said was needed to attract the
   financing that would allow it to emerge from bankruptcy protection.

   In a 26-page filing with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Chicago,
   United stopped short of issuing a formal notification that it was
   ending the plans and said it had not made a final decision to do so.

   But the warning from the airline was the clearest indication yet of its
   intent to shed its pension obligations.

   If United follows through, as its unions and industry analysts expect,
   it would be an industry milestone and a remarkable step for a company
   that was owned by its employees 20 months ago.

   No other airline has terminated all its pension plans, except in cases
   of liquidation, where the airline itself was going out of existence.
   Last year, US Airways terminated its pilots' plan but kept two other
   employee pension plans in place. It then emerged from bankruptcy and
   resumed normal operations. It was required to terminate the pilots'
   plan as a condition of the federally backed loans that paved its way
   out of bankruptcy.

   "As a labor issue, this is tremendously significant," said Gary L.
   Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in
   Worcester, Mass. Traditional pensions are a valuable benefit because
   they shield employees from market risk and come with a government
   guarantee.

   For employees accustomed to earning such benefits as a part of their
   compensation, terminating a pension plan is tantamount to cutting pay.
   Employees continue to do the same work, but they no longer earn the
   income promised for their retirements. When they retire, the federal
   government pays their benefits, and some may receive less than they
   would have had the original plan been kept intact.

   Pension specialists say that United's tremendous size means that its
   actions are likely to set a pattern that other airlines will eventually
   have to follow, cutting or shedding their pension plans to stay
   competitive.

   That would put enormous pressure on the Pension Benefit Guaranty
   Corporation , the federal agency that would assume responsibility for
   the terminated plans. While it was created to insure pension benefits,
   it would be placed in a role for which it was not designed -
   restructuring an entire industry.

   United's move came on the eve of a court hearing scheduled for this
   morning, at which Judge Eugene C. Wedoff is expected to hear motions
   from the federal pension agency, United's machinists and its flight
   attendants, all challenging the airline's efforts to get out from under
   its pension liabilities.

   Joseph Tiberi, a spokesman for the International Association of
   Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said the union had been expecting
   United to take some action to reduce its pension debt since late July,
   when the airline said it would make no further contributions to its
   four plans while it remained in bankruptcy.

   United sought court protection in December 2002 and based its plans for
   restructuring on the expectation of getting a package of federally
   backed loans. But on June 28, the Air Transportation Stabilization
   Board rejected United's application for the loan guarantees for the
   third time, forcing United, the nation's second-largest airline behind
   American Airlines, to seek private financing.

   The airline, which estimates it must contribute $4.1 billion to the
   four pension plans in the next four years alone, skipped a $72.4
   million payment owed to three of its plans last month, setting off a
   wave of anxiety among its workers. In total, the federal pension agency
   estimates that United's four plans are about $8.1 billion short of the
   value of the pensions the workers have earned so far.

   In its bankruptcy court filing yesterday, United said the rejection of
   its loan guarantee application, along with record prices for jet fuel,
   forced it to move against its retirement plans.

   United, which until recently was not protected by fuel-hedging
   contracts, estimates it will spend $1 billion more on jet fuel this
   year than it anticipated at the end of 2003.

   The airline said it "must have the cash flow and liquidity that the
   capital markets are willing to finance," and added, "We have taken
   every effort to restructure our business without affecting accrued
   pension benefits, and will continue to explore every other option."

   But "given the magnitude of further cost reductions needed to create a
   viable business plan and attract exit financing, termination and
   replacement of all our defined-benefit pension plans likely will be
   required," United said.

   By law, United cannot shed its pension debt unless it can persuade the
   bankruptcy judge that it will not survive otherwise.

   Since its bankruptcy filing, United's unions have granted $2.5 billion
   a year in wage and benefit concessions, half of the $5 billion a year
   in savings that the airline has identified.

   However, its operating costs, not including fuel, remain higher than
   those of its competitors, particularly American Airlines, which won
   wage and benefit cuts from its unions last year by threatening to file
   for bankruptcy protection.

   Indian truckers strike over tax

   Trucks standing idle in Bangalore, south India The strike is starting
   to bite as trucks sit idle

   A strike by India's biggest group of truck owners has moved into its
   third day, as a row over a new tax continues.

   About 60% of goods in India are carried by road, so the stoppage has
   led to fears of goods shortages that could fuel already-high inflation.

   Truck owners are demanding that the government withdraw a proposed 10%
   tax on freight bookings, saying it will hurt their business.

   Indian press reports said talks between the two sides might happen on
   Monday.

   The strike co-ordinators, the All India Motor Transport Congress
   (Aimtc), said nearly 2.5 million trucks were off the road on Monday,
   the Associated Press news agency reported.

   'No reversing'

   "We are determined not to pull out of the strike till the government
   withdraws these new tax proposals," said Aimtc president BN Dhumal.

   A trucker hangs out his laundry in the back of an empty vehicle More
   truckers are threatening to stop work

   Aimtc has threatened to escalate the stoppage if the government does
   not back down.

   "The remaining trucks, like tankers carrying oil, milk, vegetables and
   medicines will join in from Tuesday if the government doesn't listen to
   us," said Mr Dhumal.

   The Finance Ministry has issued a statement calling for public patience
   until it is able to explain to the truck operators that the tax on
   freight bookings does not affect them, only freight agencies.

   But the explanation failed to satisfy Aimtc, which argued that the line
   between freight agencies and truck operators is often blurred, and many
   of its members will have to pay the tax.

   There were signs on Monday that the strike has started to bite, though
   companies and households have stockpiled supplies.

   However, motor scooter maker Bajaj, which exports to the US, said on
   Monday it was struggling to ship goods from its factories. Shipments
   were "very close to stoppage," said executive director Sanjiv Bajaj.

   Economic angst

   "The strike will give rise to inflation and will adversely affect
   exports, economy and productivity," said the All India Association of
   Industries.

   India's economy is growing strongly, but inflation is causing concern.
   In the week to 7 August it hit 7.9% - its highest level for
   three-and-a-half years.

   The dispute highlights a broader economic policy dilemma facing the
   left-leaning government.

   It introduced the controversial tax in its 2004/05 budget in an attempt
   to bolster revenue, which it needs to keep its pledges to the rural
   poor who swept it into power.

Markets Up as Oil Continues to Slide

   Markets Up as Oil Continues to Slide

   The easing of oil prices will likely let investors focus on a new batch
   of economic data and other factors, such as next week's Republican
   National Convention, which is expected to keep trading volumes on Wall
   Street low and will officially kick off the home stretch of the
   presidential campaign.
   By ECT News Business Desk
   Aug 25, 2004 1:48 PM PT

   Oil continued its late summer retreat from record price levels
   Wednesday, falling nearly 4 percent to its lowest price levels in two
   weeks.

   The price drop allowed for another rally on Wall Street, one that while
   more robust than previous days still was being downplayed by many
   observers because of low volumes typical for the last two weeks before
   the unofficial end of summer.

   Still, the Dow managed to tack on 83.11 to climb to 10,181.74. The
   Nasdaq gained 23.83 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 1,860.72, while
   the S&P 500 gained 8.77 points to 1,104.96.

   The easing of oil prices will likely let investors focus on a new batch
   of economic data and other factors, such as next week's Republican
   National Convention, which is expected to keep trading volumes on Wall
   Street low and will officially kick off the home stretch of the
   presidential campaign.

   This week's batch of economic data include weak numbers for sales of
   both new and existing homes, both of which were down sharply in July.
   New home sales fell 6.4 percent last month to the lowest level of the
   year.

   That data came after a report said sales of existing homes fell nearly
   3 percent in July.

   Orders for durable goods, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent in July, but much
   of the gain was attributed to orders for passenger aircraft.

   US employment outlook improves

   DaimlerChrysler factory
   US businesses hired more workers in August

   The pace of new job creation accelerated sharply in the US last month,
   reinforcing hopes that the economy is strengthening.

   A total of 144,000 new jobs were created in August, up sharply from
   32,000 the previous month, the Labor Department said.

   The figure fell just short of the 150,000 pencilled in by forecasters.

   The Labor Department also said 59,000 more jobs had been created in
   June and July than previously thought.

   We are still seeing hesitancy on the part of employers to add workers

   Gary Thayer, AG Edwards & Sons

   The headline unemployment rate fell by a tenth of a percentage point to
   5.4%, its lowest level in nearly three years.

   "The unemployment rate has come down, which is an encouraging sign that
   the expansion is still continuing at an average rate or better," said
   Gary Thayer, an economist at AG Edwards & Sons.

   "But we are still seeing hesitancy on the part of employers to add
   workers."

   Election issue

   The figures were welcomed by George W Bush, who has been criticised for
   presiding over large-scale job losses since taking office in 2000.

   "Our growing economy is spreading prosperity and opportunity, and
   nothing will hold us back," Mr Bush said during an appearance in
   Pennsylvania.

   "Overall, we've added about 1.7 million jobs since August 2003; the
   unemployment rate is down to 5.4%," he said.

   "That's nearly a full point below the rate last summer and below the
   average of the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s."

   John Kerry, the Democrat candidate in November's presidential election,
   has tried to capitalise on Mr Bush's lacklustre jobs record.

   Even though the US economy has created jobs, there have been an
   estimated 2.7 million lay-offs during the downturn that took hold in
   2001 and 2002.

   Different view

   Mr Kerry told voters on Friday that his opponent "is now certain to be
   the first president since the Great Depression to face re-election
   without creating a single job".

   On Wall Street, analysts said the encouraging jobs news had helped to
   neutralise the impact of a downbeat sales forecast from semiconductor
   giant Intel.

   The Dow Jones index of leading US shares was little changed at
   10,292.40.

   Analysts say the economy needs to add about 150,000 new jobs every
   month just to keep pace with population growth.

   A figure of 200,000 or more is usually seen as a sign of fast economic
   growth.

   HBOS 'may trump Abbey buyout bid'

   Abbey sign
   The merger will create the world's eighth biggest bank

   HBOS will decide this week whether it will table a bid for high street
   rival Abbey, newspaper reports claim.

   According to the Sunday Telegraph an HBOS decision on a possible bid to
   challenge Spanish Bank Santander Central Hispano "is on a knife edge".

   The HBOS board is will discuss a bid this week and could possibly table
   an offer on Monday, the Observer added.

   Newspaper speculation suggests that an offer from HBOS will be around
   £10bn - more than Santander's £8.6bn.

   However, HBOS refused to comment on the claims.

   Speedy deal

   "We said some time ago we were in the early stages of considering
   whether we would or would not bid for Abbey," an HBOS spokesman said.

   "That remains the case and there can be no certainty that we will
   proceed with a bid."

   If HBOS does decide to make an offer for Abbey it will have to move
   quickly.

   Abbey is expected to post the Spanish bank's bid document to
   shareholders next week, while Santander has said it wants to complete
   the deal a month earlier than planned.

   Juan Inciarte, the Santander executive in charge of the Abbey bid, said
   last weekend that he hoped to wrap up the deal by November rather than
   the end of the year.

   The Sunday Telegraph added that any decision by HBOS would depend on
   its lawyers' analysis of whether a deal would be blocked by the UK's
   competition watchdogs.

   Three years ago, Lloyds TSB launched a high-profile bid for Abbey, but
   was blocked on competition grounds.

   Buying Abbey is seen as the last major merger opportunity within the UK
   banking sector, which has undergone a wave of consolidation in the past
   10 years.

   Jobs fears

   Under the terms of Santander's offer any prospective rival bidders have
   until Abbey's extraordinary general meeting in October to state their
   intention to table an offer.

   Santander is using a scheme of arrangement to bid for the bank, as just
   75% of Abbey's shareholders need to agree the deal for Santander to win
   total control of Abbey.

   A normal offer could require 90% approval from shareholders.

   Santander has said its takeover would trigger just 3,000 job losses
   amid the UK bank's 26,000 employees, mainly because it does not intend
   to close any branches.

   However, reports claim that if HBOS wins out many High Street branches
   would disappear as they are located too close to the 741 sites owned by
   Abbey.

   Unions agree Alitalia pilot deal

   Alitalia plane
   The airline has set a deadline of Wednesday for an agreement

   Trades unions at the near-bankrupt Italian state airline, Alitalia,
   have agreed on a new contract for pilots.

   The deal, a vital first step to the airline's survival, will cut their
   pay and nearly double their flying hours.

   Alitalia has struggled financially since the 11 September attacks and
   is said to be losing $60,000 an hour.

   The rescue plan, which includes about 5,000 job cuts, must be agreed on
   Wednesday if Alitalia is to receive a key $482m government-guaranteed
   loan.

   Alitalia management and labour unions are holding further talks to
   reach an agreement on cabin crew and ground staff by the Wednesday
   deadline set by the airline's chief executive Giancarlo Cimoli.

   Rumours of progress in overnight talks saw the Italian airline's shares
   close up 15% on Tuesday in Milan, building on a 7% jump on Monday.

   Bail out or bust

   Mr Cimoli has said that unions must agree to his restructuring plan or
   he will file to put the company into administration. Alitalia is 62%
   owned by the Italian state.

   Unions said that the accord on pilots' conditions was a "turning
   point", adding that they were "certain" a deal on other Alitalia staff
   was possible.

   Pilots will nearly double the 450 hours they currently fly each year,
   as well as taking a pay cut, which willl save the airline 52m euros
   ($63m) in 2006.

   The airline said it needs union agreement on the survival plan by 15
   September or it would fail to qualify for a 400m euro ($482m; £271m)
   bridging loan that has been approved by the Italian government and the
   European Union.

   It has warned that it will run out of money by the end of the month if
   the rescue package is rejected by the unions.

   The problems facing Alitalia are far from unique.

   Flag carriers have been hit by the emergence of low-cost rivals, as
   well as high fuel costs and a slump in demand for air travel following
   the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US and an outbreak of
   the killer Sars flu virus in Asia.

   First profit for steelmaker Corus

   Corus steelworker
   A pick up in global growth has stoked demand for steel

   Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus has reported a profit for the first time
   since it was formed in 1999.

   Surging steel prices have helped the company lift earnings, and it has
   cut jobs and sold a number of businesses.

   Pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of June was £163m ($288m)
   from a loss of £89m a year earlier. Sales rose 11% to £4.48bn, up from
   £4.02bn.

   The BBC's business editor Jeff Randall called the turnaround
   extraordinary, but warned it depended on steel prices.

   Should steel prices come down, then earnings will once again be under
   pressure, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

   'Significant change'

   For its part, Corus is optimistic about the future, saying it expects
   profit will continue to improve during the second half of 2004.

   Underpinning prices is a rebound in global economic growth, especially
   in China.

   Steel producers have been able to recover the increased costs (of raw
   materials) in the form of higher steel prices

   Corus statement

   See Corus's latest share price

   "The world steel market has experienced significant change over the
   last year," Corus said in its statement.

   It estimated that Chinese demand jumped by 15% in the first half of
   2004 from a year earlier, accounting for about a quarter of total
   consumption worldwide.

   "The impact of this performance was to affect the supply/demand
   position of both steelmaking raw materials and the world steel market,"
   the company said.

   It went on to explain that China's hunger for commodities gobbled up
   the world's surplus steel production and led to more expensive raw
   materials.

   World steel demand, meanwhile, increased by 5%, with growth strong in
   the US and steady in the EU and Japan.

   tubing
   More changes are in the pipeline

   "The combination of raw material shortages, growing demand and a much
   reduced capacity surplus has meant that steel producers have been able
   to recover the increased costs in the form of higher steel prices,"
   Corus said.

   Eye on costs

   A significant part of profit in the first half of the year came from
   cost cutting measures that are part of the company's "Restoring
   Success" programme.

   By the end of June 2004, Corus estimated it had trimmed outgoings by
   £220m a year. The plan is for total annual savings of £680m by 2007.

   The company is still looking at how to squeeze more from its operation
   and uncertainty still hangs over its Teesside plant.

   Corus also has operations in Port Talbot, Scunthorpe and Rotherham.

   It was formed by merging British Steel with Dutch producer Koninklijke
   Hoogovens.

   Halliburton may sell troubled KBR

   US troops
   KBR supplies housing and food to US troops in Iraq

   Halliburton said it will restructure and may even sell its Kellogg,
   Brown and Root subsidiary, the business at the root of recent
   controversy.

   KBR, an engineering and construction business, has come under scrutiny
   over contracts in Iraq and employee corruption in Nigeria.

   Halliburton will decide on the future of KBR once it has settled the
   unit's $4.2bn (£3.2bn) asbestos claims bill.

   It will favour a sale if the overhaul fails to boost the share price.

   'Frustrating'

   "We're looking for improvement in the near term," said Halliburton
   chief financial officer Chris Gaut.

   This is a new KBR. We will be a streamlined, efficient and more
   profitable organisation

   Andrew Lane, KBR chief executive

   "This is not something we can let go on and on. This is frustrating for
   us as a management team, frustrating for our shareholders."

   Halliburton plans to pull together KBR's five units into two divisions,
   a move it forecasts will save it as much as $100m (£55m; 81m euros) a
   year.

   The two divisions will cover energy and chemicals, the other government
   and infrastructure projects.

   "This is a new KBR. We will be a streamlined, efficient and more
   profitable organisation", said KBR chief executive Andrew Lane.

   Troubling business

   The asbestos claims are the biggest financial headache facing KBR,
   which inherited the claims from Dresser Industries when it bought that
   firm five years ago.

   But the claims are not the only embarrassment.

   It is being investigated for over-charging the Pentagon on several
   military supply contracts.

   KBR'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS

   Iraq: Investigation into over-charging for military contracts
   United States: Facing $4.2bn asbestos claims bill
   Nigeria: Investigation into alleged bribes on gas deals
   Brazil: Major project over budget, costing firm $750m

   Halliburton, which was headed by US Vice-President Dick Cheney until he
   ran for office in 2000, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing with
   regard to the Iraqi contracts.

   The company, in its defence, says it has become a lightning rod for
   political opposition to President Bush's Iraq policy.

   It has been beset with problems in Nigeria too. Earlier this year,
   Halliburton severed ties with KBR ex-chairman Jack Stanley over
   allegations of financial impropriety.

   KBR is being investigated by the US stock market regulator over
   allegations it paid bribes for Nigerian gas deals.

   The Nigerian government has banned another Halliburton subsidiary,
   Halliburton Energy Services Nigeria, from state contracts after
   radiation-emitting equipment went missing.

   Cost overruns on a Brazilian offshore project, Barracuda-Caratinga,
   have forced KBR to take charges of more than $750m in its accounts
   since 2002, but are now under control, the Wall Street Journal
   reported.

   Halliburton's shares came within sight of a 12-month high on Thursday,
   but the group acknowledges that its stock is less-highly regarded as an
   investment proposition than that of its rivals.

   Taking the price-to-earnings ratio, Halliburton's share price is 20.5
   times earnings, whereas rivals can command 26.5 times, Mr Gaut said.
   The ratio measures what investors pay for the stock against what they
   can expect to pocket in dividends.

   Halliburton has not set a deadline for a decision on whether to keep
   KBR.

   Union to meet P&O over job cuts

   A P&O ferry
   P&O has faced competition from budget airlines

   Union officials are due to meet the management of ferry company P&O on
   Tuesday after it emerged that the company may announce heavy job
   losses.

   The company could lose up to 1,000 workers in Dover and Portsmouth, as
   it struggles to compete with budget airlines and Eurotunnel.

   Members of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) will attend a
   meeting with company bosses in Dover.

   P&O is expected to make its announcement on Tuesday morning.

   Union leaders have warned P&O they face industrial action if they
   announce job losses as part of a drive to cut costs.

   On Monday, the RMT criticised a "lack of consultation", saying it would
   not tolerate compulsory redundancies.

   We will draw a line in the sand at compulsory job losses

   Bob Crow
   RMT

   Losses at P&O's ferry arm for the six months to 30 June were £25.1m,
   compared to £19.9m a year earlier, while revenues were down to £467.1m
   from £505.7m.

   RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, complained the company had not
   consulted properly with its workforce.

   "We found out that we were being consulted over the possibility of job
   cuts when we read about it in the media.

   "It is no use consulting us after a decision has been taken. We need
   meaningful consultations before any announcement is made.

   "We are happy to talk about efficiencies but we remain opposed to
   redundancies and we will draw a line in the sand at compulsory job
   losses."

   The union says P&O was one of the ship companies which had benefited
   from the tonnage tax which had cost the taxpayer more than £100m.

   P&O were not available for comment ahead of their announcement.

   Banks sound alarm on online fraud

   Bogus emails
   Some 2,000 online account holders have been taken in by the scam

   The banking industry has warned customers with online accounts to guard
   against a new wave of cyber fraud.

   Industry body Apacs said some 2,000 British online account holders had
   been taken in by scams in the past year, losing £4.5m between them.

   Many were duped into revealing their account passwords by phoney
   e-mails purporting to come from their bank.

   Others had their computers infected with programs which allow
   fraudsters to record their log-in details.

   Vigilance

   Apacs is launching a website, banksafeonline.org.uk, which tells online
   account holders how to protect themselves.

   The organisation said account holders should treat all unsolicited
   e-mails with caution, and should make sure that their computers are
   fitted with the latest anti-virus software.

   According to an Apacs survey, 4% of the UK's online account holders
   would automatically respond to e-mails that appeared to come from their
   bank.

   About a quarter of them have no updated virus checker on their
   computers, while more than 40% do not have an active firewall, the poll
   showed.

   "The new website will hopefully encourage anyone who hasn't thought
   about protecting themselves before to start doing so now," said Apacs
   spokeswoman Sandra Quinn.

   Ms Quinn stressed that online bank fraud remained far less widespread
   than credit card fraud, which has affected one in three of all British
   cardholders.

   The phoney e-mail scams, known as "phishing," were first reported in
   the UK in September 2003, and reached a peak in May and June this year.

   There has since been an increase in the number of cases where account
   holders' computers become infected with malicious viruses, dubbed
   "Trojan" attacks.

   Gangsters

   Online bank fraud is usually perpetrated by organised crime groups,
   often based in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, according to
   the National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), a police body formed in 2001
   to tackle cyber crime.

   The proceeds of the scam are typically transferred to British accounts
   held by local accomplices, who then wire the money overseas in exchange
   for a commission.

   In May, police arrested 12 people in London and the south-east on
   suspicion of acting as intermediaries for fraud gangs based in eastern
   Europe.

   Detective Inspector Mick Randall of the NHTCU said close cooperation
   between British police and their counterparts in several European
   countries had recently resulted in a number of "significant" arrests in
   Russia.

   Reuters sees India as data hub

   Financial information
   Technical staff and journalists will be based in Bangalore

   News and information provider Reuters has said it plans to make
   Bangalore its biggest information-gathering hub.

   The southern Indian city will employ 1,500 staff - or 10% of Reuters'
   total workforce - the UK-based company said.

   The majority of the staff will be data and technical employees, but
   Reuters said it planned to employ up to 40 journalists in its Bangalore
   newsroom.

   Bangalore is increasingly seen as a hot spot for jobs in information
   technology and back-office services.

   Newsgathering hub

   Reuters plans to have up to 400 employees compiling and analysing data
   in Bangalore by the end of 2004, the company's editor-in-chief and head
   of content operations, Geert Linnebank, said.

   "What we are creating here is the largest single hub of information
   gathering" within Reuters, Mr Linnebank said.

   The Bangalore office will employ 1,000 people by the end of 2005 and
   between 1,200 and 1,500 people over the next 18 months, he said.

   Reuters, which has its headquarters in London, first began operations
   in India in 1866, providing news and commodity prices to European
   markets.

   The company has 14,700 staff around the world, of whom about 2,300 are
   journalists.

   Alitalia secures 400m euro loan

   Alitalia plane
   Alitalia has only made a profit four times in the last 16 years

   Alitalia has reached agreement with the Italian government on a 400m
   euro (£275m) loan to aid the restructuring of the struggling airline.

   Alitalia can access the emergency fund, guaranteed by the Italian
   Economy Ministry, any time in the next six months and must repay it
   within a year.

   The state airline is cutting 3,700 of its 20,700 staff as it seeks to
   return to profit within three years.

   The loan deal was dependent on Alitalia agreeing pay-off terms with
   unions.

   As part of a deal struck earlier this month, staff being made redundant
   will get two years of state welfare benefits, while remaining on the
   company's books for two years.

   They will then get three years of redundancy payments at a lower level.

   Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with
   high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and
   reduced demand.

   The loan is being provided by investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort
   Wasserstein, part of Dresdner Bank.

   Corruption probe hits US insurers

   US general attorney Elliot Spitzer points to part of his law suit
   against Marsh & McLennan
   The lawsuit's implications are likely to be felt across the industry

   US insurers are in the spotlight after New York attorney general Elliot
   Spitzer sued Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker.

   Mr Spitzer claims that since the late 1990s, Marsh got illegal payments
   for steering clients to firms such as Ace and American International
   Group (AIG).

   On Wall Street on Friday, Marsh shares fell 14%, with AIG down 4%.

   Marsh said it had been unaware of the charges until they were brought,
   and promised to co-operate.

   "We are committed to getting all the facts, determining any incidence
   of improper behaviour, and dealing with appropriately with any
   wrongdoing," it said in a statement.

   It added that it had suspended the deals with insurers - known as
   "placement services agreements" - which Mr Spitzer alleged were used as
   the vehicles for the payments.

   "Today's decision was made in light of the serious allegations... that
   have been raised about this long-standing industry practice," Marsh
   said.

   Shares tumble

   The other firms named in Mr Spitzer's investigation include Hartford
   Financial Services Group, Chubb Corp and an arm of Germany's Munich Re.

   The magnitude and breadth of these events could be significant if
   bid-rigging is found to be widespread throughout the insurance industry

   Sandller O'Neil, New York

   See here for AIG share price
   See here for Marsh & McLennan share price

   Hartford shares fell 3.7%, extending a decline of 6% the day before.
   Marsh shares had slumped 25% on Thursday, with AIG and Ace each down
   10%.

   Ace said it would continue to cooperate on the matter, while Hartford
   said that it does not condone illegal activities such as bid rigging.

   Insurers fell across Europe as well, with the UK's Royal & Sun Alliance
   and Prudential both feeling the pain, along with Germany's Munich Re.

   "At this early stage, forecasts of the ramifications for the industry
   are necessarily speculative," wrote analysts at Sandller O'Neil in New
   York on Friday.

   "The magnitude and breadth of these events could be significant if
   bid-rigging is found to be widespread throughout the insurance
   industry."

   Links

   Three of the firms under the spotlight have family connections.

   This investigation is broad and deep and it is disappointing

   Eliot Spitzer
   New York attorney general

   AIG, the world's largest insurer by market value, is run by chairman
   and chief executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg.

   One son, Jeffrey, heads Marsh, while a second, Evan, is in charge of
   Bermuda-based Ace.

   During a conference call with analysts, Hank Greenberg denied that AIG
   top executives had been involved with or knew about the activities
   being investigated.

   The firm, he said, had started an internal inquiry led by an outside
   lawyer after receiving subpoenas earlier this year.

   The inquiry had found problems in its American Home subsidiary, two of
   whose executives had pleaded guilty to related charges, he said, adding
   that AIG continued to co-operate.

   On a mission

   Mr Spitzer has earned a reputation as a crusading attorney general and
   a scourge of corporate wrong-doing.

   He has made his name taking on some of Wall Street's biggest names,
   winning settlements more often than not, and forcing them to rethink
   the way they work.

   In this case, Mr Spitzer alleges that unsuspecting clients were
   deliberately steered to firms in return for lucrative payoffs, a move
   which pushed up prices.

   He also claims that a number of the firms were involved in bid rigging,
   whereby they fixed quotes, only giving the appearance of competition.

   "This investigation is broad and deep and it is disappointing," Mr
   Spitzer said at a press conference.

   It shows the "disregard for ethics and the law among some of our
   largest corporations", he added.

   UK reinsurance firm the Benfield Group said its US subsidiary has been
   subpoenaed to assist with the investigation, although it stressed it
   was not subject to formal investigation.

   Insurers fell across Europe as well, with the UK's Royal & Sun Alliance
   and Prudential both feeling the pain, along with Germany's Munich Re.

   "At this early stage, forecasts of the ramifications for the industry
   are necessarily speculative," wrote analysts at Sandller O'Neil in New
   York on Friday.

   "The magnitude and breadth of these events could be significant if
   bid-rigging is found to be widespread throughout the insurance
   industry."

   Three of the firms under the spotlight have family connections.

   This investigation is broad and deep and it is disappointing

   Eliot Spitzer
   New York attorney general

   AIG, the world's largest insurer by market value, is run by chairman
   and chief executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg.

   One son, Jeffrey, heads Marsh, while a second, Evan, is in charge of
   Bermuda-based Ace.

   During a conference call with analysts, Hank Greenberg denied that AIG
   top executives had been involved with or knew about the activities
   being investigated.

   The firm, he said, had started an internal inquiry led by an outside
   lawyer after receiving subpoenas earlier this year.

   The inquiry had found problems in its American Home subsidiary, two of
   whose executives had pleaded guilty to related charges, he said, adding
   that AIG continued to co-operate.

   On a mission

   Mr Spitzer has earned a reputation as a crusading attorney general and
   a scourge of corporate wrong-doing.

   He has made his name taking on some of Wall Street's biggest names,
   winning settlements more often than not, and forcing them to rethink
   the way they work.

   In this case, Mr Spitzer alleges that unsuspecting clients were
   deliberately steered to firms in return for lucrative payoffs, a move
   which pushed up prices.

   He also claims that a number of the firms were involved in bid rigging,
   whereby they fixed quotes, only giving the appearance of competition.

   "This investigation is broad and deep and it is disappointing," Mr
   Spitzer said at a press conference.

   It shows the "disregard for ethics and the law among some of our
   largest corporations", he added.

   UK reinsurance firm the Benfield Group said its US subsidiary has been
   subpoenaed to assist with the investigation, although it stressed it
   was not subject to formal investigation.

   The challenges facing Sainsbury's new chief
   By Jorn Madslien
   BBC News business reporter

   Justin King in a Sainsbury's store
   Can the fresh-faced 43-year-old help Sainsbury's bounce back?

   J Sainsbury's chief executive, Justin King, has been given one of the
   toughest jobs in British retailing - turning around the troubled
   supermarket chain. The outcome could make or break both him and his
   company.

   Officially, Mr King has kept a low profile since he was appointed chief
   executive on 29 March this year.

   The fresh-faced 43-year-old has routinely declined interview requests
   from journalists and he has only spoken openly to the financial markets
   when forced to do so.

   And so far, Mr King has remained tight-lipped about any strategy he
   might have for reviving the Sainsbury's supermarket chain.

   Game plan

   But on Tuesday this week, in his first major public appearance, Mr King
   will face the world and unveil his action plan.

   Much of what he will say is known already.

   Profit predictions for 2004 have fallen throughout the year as analysts
   have digested facts

   January: £600m
   March: £510m
   July: £410m
   October: £200m-300m

   This is partly due to last week's profit warning, the company's third
   this year.

   Mr King was forced to admit that Sainsbury's profits fell to around
   £130m in the six months ending 9 October from £366m during the same
   period last year.

   But it is also thanks to Sainsbury's tireless grooming of both
   journalists and analysts ahead of Tuesday's public declaration. Behind
   the scenes, Mr King has been busy making his mark.

   Credibility

   Sainsbury's intention of smoothing the rocky path ahead for Mr King is
   understandable.

   Justin King receives the first annual award for Compassionate
   Supermarket of the Year launched by the pressure group Compassion in
   World Farming, from food author Audrey Eyton.
   Times were less tough for Mr King when he worked at Marks & Spencer

   Sadly, both for him and Sainsbury's shareholders, it has not always had
   the desired effect.

   One of the company's briefings for analysts sparked controversy earlier
   this month.

   The Financial Services Authority said it would investigate the
   tete-a-tete with a Merrill Lynch analyst because of concerns that it
   was in breach of the stock exchange rules.

   The probe has come at a bad time for Mr King, especially as it makes it
   harder for him to build a credible image for himself and the management
   team he has put together during the past few months.

   Predators

   The challenge facing the team is a large one.

   Sainsbury's has been suffering for years; in fact, it has recently come
   to light that it has failed to grow in real terms during any of the
   last 20 years.

   Its competitors, meanwhile, have stormed ahead and the supermarket
   landscape is full of hungry predators keen to eat further into
   Sainsbury's dwindling market share.

   And Mr King's firm seems too weak to take on most of them.

   Upmarket Marks & Spencer and Waitrose are well beyond reach, while
   market leaders Asda and Tesco are roaring ahead, bolstered by their
   foray into non-food retailing.

   Tasks ahead

   Sainsbury's is expected to aim for a narrow niche somewhere in the
   middle.

   Sainsbury's store
   Customers still visit Sainsbury's but they spend too little cash

   Apparently, the customers are there. But while they may be visiting
   Sainsbury's stores, they do not seem to be buying all their goods from
   one retailer.

   Sainsbury's is expected to cut prices, in particular on basic bulk
   items like toilet paper and soft drinks, in the hope of convincing
   shoppers to leave behind more cash on each visit.

   However, the price discounts may have to be funded by dividend cuts, a
   move that would hurt the founding Sainsbury family which owns just over
   a third of the firm's shares.

   Mr King is also expected to revamp Sainsbury's distribution chain to
   make sure customers are presented with a more consistent offering
   whenever they visit the stores.

   And he may well push ahead with a limited foray into the non-food
   market by offering more DVDs, baby wear and toasters - though on a much
   smaller scale than some of its competitors because Sainsbury's stores
   tend to be smaller.

   Track record

   Beyond pointing out what is wrong with Sainsbury's at the moment, a
   core part of Mr King's presentation on Tuesday is expected to aim at
   strengthening links and trust with investors.

   He is expected to do this by highlighting both his team's and his own
   track record.

   Mr King is old beyond his years in terms of retail experience and he
   has worked at both more and less upmarket supermarkets than
   Sainsbury's.

   Until last winter, Mr King was director of food at Marks & Spencer;
   before then he was Asda Hypermarkets' retail managing director.

   Despite that, analysts remain concerned about his lack of experience
   when it comes to turning around troubled companies.

   EU suspends US export sanctions

   US container port
   Tariffs on US imports to Europe are being lifted

   The European Union is to suspend sanctions on US imports worth $4bn
   after President Bush signed a bill removing illegal export subsidies.

   The move could end a dispute which began in 2003 when the Word Trade
   Organisation ruled that the US subsidies breached trade laws.

   The EU retaliated in March this year with tariffs on a range of US
   goods.

   Brussels said it would ask the WTO to review the situation, and would
   not rule out reimposing sanctions.

   Options open

   EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy welcomed the US bill repealing export
   subsidies, which was signed into law by President Bush last week.

   As a result, some $5bn in financial assistance for US exporters will be
   phased out between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2006.

   However, Mr Lamy expressed concerns about a clause in the bill which he
   said could potentially permit tax breaks for export contracts which
   last beyond the 2006 deadline.

   "Legally speaking we will suspend the sanctions and we will keep our
   options open," Mr Lamy said.

   "There is a possibility of (renewed) sanctions. We will see what the
   WTO says."

   The WTO said the subsidies - passed by the US Congress in 2000 - were
   illegal in January 2003.

   Under WTO rules, the decision gave the EU the right to slap 100% import
   tariffs on a range of US goods.

   The tariff levels, originally set at 5%, rose 1% for every month in
   which the US subsidies remained in place.

   Strained relations

   EU trade ministers must approve the Commission's decision, although
   this is expected to be a formality.

   The row over export subsidies is just one of a number of disputes
   weighing on transatlantic trade relations.

   The most high profile of these is a row over the support that both
   sides provide to their aircraft industries.

   The US claims that the financial support European governments provide
   to aircraft maker Airbus is in breach of world trade rules, while the
   EU says the same is true of Washington's subsidies for Boeing.

   Profit dip at Buffett's Berkshire

   Warren Buffett
   Mr Buffett is not afraid of being a lone voice in the marketplace

   Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by billionaire Warren Buffett, has
   reported a drop in quarterly profits after hurricanes cost it $816m
   (£439m).

   The Caribbean and southern US have been hit by four storms this year,
   causing widespread damage and leaving insurers with billions of dollars
   of claims.

   Berkshire also had to write off the cost of a failed mining project.

   Net income was $1.14bn in the three months through September, down from
   $1.8bn a year earlier.

   Casting around

   Mr Buffett, the world's second-richest man, has built Berkshire into a
   firm with interests ranging from clothing to insurance to carpets to
   plane rentals.

   The company still is on the look-out for acquisition opportunities and
   increased its cash holdings to $38bn in the third quarter, up from
   $31bn a year earlier.

   Mr Buffett also has been betting that the US dollar would weaken and
   the company said it now has foreign currency contracts worth $20bn.

   The dollar dropped to a record low on Friday against the euro and many
   analysts are predicting that more declines are on the cards.

   Shares in Berkshire slid $510 on Friday to $83,390. A Berkshire share
   would have cost an investor $175 in 1978.

   Cuban US dollar ban takes effect

   People queue to exchange dollars in Cuba
   Cubans have rushed to exchange money before the deadline

   Cuba has ended circulation of the US dollar in an attempt to resist a
   tightening US blockade.

   Dollar transactions that have been allowed for the last 11 years were
   replaced by convertible Cuban pesos, which are worthless outside Cuba.

   Cubans will have to pay a 10% surcharge to exchange US currency.

   Cubans can still keep dollars at home and hold dollar bank accounts,
   but President Fidel Castro has banned the use of dollars in
   transactions.

   The Cuban leader announced the change of policy accusing Washington of
   "mafia-like" moves limiting cash and people flows to the island.

   Cubans have seen their economy deteriorate in recent years because of
   the embargo and the loss of European communist allies.

   They have been queuing at special exchange counters to swap dollars for
   convertible pesos, which will be worth $1 in Cuba but will be worthless
   abroad.

   The change will be felt by everyone in Cuba, where many everyday
   transactions were carried out in dollars.

   In a sign that authorities had underestimated how many dollars were
   being horded, the deadline for converting the currency was extended
   until 14 November. After that, the 10% surcharge will apply.

   Wal-Mart expects bumper Christmas

   Wal-Mart store
   The world's largest retail group is on course for a record year

   The world's largest retailer Wal-Mart has reported rising profits and
   said it is optimistic it will see sales accelerate over the festive
   season.

   Wal-Mart said pre-tax profits in the three months to the end of October
   were $3.5bn (£1.8bn), compared with $3.2bn in the same period last
   year.

   It said higher labour and fuel costs were affecting earnings but it was
   set for record annual profits in 2004.

   Global sales at Wal-Mart, which owns UK supermarket Asda, rose 9.7% to
   $68.5bn.

   Sales at its international stores rose by 18% to $13.55bn, the company
   said.

   Like-for-like sales at its US outlets - a measure which strips out the
   effect of new store openings - rose 1.7% in the quarter, Wal-Mart said.

   "I believe sales momentum will accelerate into the holiday," Wal-Mart
   chief Lee Scott said.

   "We should have a better Christmas than last year."

   Overall, sales for the year so far were $205bn, up 11.6% on the same
   point last year.

   Krispy Kreme in new sticky mess

   Krispy Kreme coffee and doughnut
   Fatty fast foods have come under fire from diet gurus

   Shares in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts have plummeted by almost 20% after the
   firm announced a quarterly loss of $3m due to store closures and poor
   sales.

   The firm posted losses of $3m for the third quarter ending 31 October
   compared with profits of $14.5m a year earlier.

   The company also withdrew its prediction that sales would rise 15% for
   the year ending in January.

   Krispy Kreme has recently been hit by the craze for low-carb diets.

   Diet factor

   It is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
   (SEC) into how it accounted for the repurchase of franchises and
   lowered profit forecasts.

   There is a group of consumers who have altered their purchasing habits
   because of dietary concerns

   Scott Livengood, Krispy Kreme

   "We only see negatives in the Krispy Kreme earnings release this
   morning," J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe told the Reuters news
   agency.

   Some observers say the store has expanded too quickly and that its
   doughnuts lost some of their appeal once they were sold in places like
   supermarkets and convenience stores.

   "There is a group of consumers who have altered their purchasing habits
   because of dietary concerns," Krispy Kreme chief executive Scott
   Livengood said on Monday.

   Krispy Kreme, which went public in 2000, has lost more than 80% of its
   market value since August 2003.

   Greece warned on false euro data
   By Manuela Saragosa
   BBC Europe business reporter in Brussels

   Greek finance minister George Alogoskoufis
   The Greek finance minister has promised to tackle the issue

   Greece has received a formal warning from the European Commission for
   publishing false data about its public finances.

   The Commission found that Greece had hugely underreported its budget
   deficit between 1997 and 1999.

   Greece had admitted that it would not have qualified to join the euro
   in 2001 if the true state of its budget deficit had been known at the
   time.

   Greece could face legal proceedings if it does not change its
   procedures.

   Deficit inaccuracies

   The warning follows an investigation into Greece's public finances by
   Eurostat, the Commission's statistical agency.

   Greece would not have joined the euro with the figures that we now have

   Amelia Torres, European Commission spokeswoman

   The body found that Greece's deficit in 1997 was actually 6.6% of its
   GDP, not 4% as was reported at the time.

   Eurostat has also revised upwards Greece's deficit figures for 1998 and
   1999.

   In both years, Greece's deficit was above the 3% cap which the EU
   imposes on states wanting to join the euro.

   The Commission said it wanted Greece to take steps to ensure its data
   can be trusted in future, producing accurate figures about how much the
   government is spending.

   Putting house in order

   "The purpose of the infringement procedure is to ensure that Greece
   puts its house in order," said Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres.

   "Greece would not have joined the euro with the figures that we now
   have," she added.

   The Commission will send the Greek Government a letter of formal notice
   on Wednesday.

   Greece will have two months to reply.

   But if the Commission is not happy with its answer the matter could end
   up in court.

   The Greek government will persist in the policy of transparency and
   credibility of fiscal data

   Yiorgos Alogoskoufis, finance minister

   The Greek government said it had made progress in improving the
   country's accounting processes since it took office in March.

   It confirmed it would take further action to ensure Greece was not
   referred to the European Court of Justice.

   "The Greek government will persist in the policy of transparency and
   credibility of fiscal data with a view to complete the effort that
   began after the (March) elections," said finance minister Yiorgos
   Alogoskoufis.

   "Today's government reestablishes the country's credibility," he added.

   Eurostat criticised

   Eurostat was also criticised for failing to raise the alarm about the
   quality of Greece's budget data.

   So far, no-one has been officially blamed for what amounts to the EU's
   most serious statistical embarrassment since the launch of the single
   currency.

   The Commission said the agency had shown a "lack of awareness to bring
   the problem to the right public level instead of having a closed
   discussion between statisticians".

   Greece may still face separate disciplinary action from the Commission
   for breaching EU limits on its deficit this year.

   That could lead to fines over and above any measures taken to ensure
   its statistics are accurate in future.

   Villagers hold Nigeria oil plants

   Shell flow station in Nigeria
   The Delta region holds the bulk of Nigeria's oil reserves

   Multinational oil companies have begun talks with Nigerian villagers
   who took over three oil installations on Sunday.

   A spokesman said people from a remote Delta region community were
   protesting that they had been overlooked for jobs.

   Such protests are common in the Delta region. Although the Delta region
   produces the bulk of Nigeria's crude oil, most people live in poverty.

   The plants are run by the Nigerian wing of the Anglo-Dutch
   multinational Shell, and the US company ChevronTexaco.

   "Our preference is for dialogue rather than a forceful end to the
   situation," a ChevronTexaco spokesman said.

   "We are concerned for the safety of the occupiers and the employees and
   that is why we are appealing to them to vacate so that we can engage
   with them directly," he added.

   A Shell representative said many of those who seized the platforms have
   now left them for talks.

   "Most of the groups have now left the stations, but they left 20
   invaders behind to ensure that we don't reopen the flow stations," said
   a Shell spokesman.

   Stormed

   Early on Sunday morning, men and women from the Kula community in River
   state stormed at least three oil installations.

   They closed down the Shell-operated Ekulama One flow station and then
   occupied the nearby Ekulama Two.

   The Chevron-run Robert-Kiri flow station was also affected.

   Chevron say they have arranged talks with Rivers state governor Peter
   Odili to look for a solution.

   The lost production is estimated at about 90,000 barrels a day.
   Nigeria's normal daily output is about 2.5 million barrels.

   The paramount ruler of Kula, chief Dan Opusingi, told the BBC by phone
   from Ekulama Two that his people had decided to stage the peaceful
   protest because they have been overlooked for jobs and development by
   the oil companies.

   Last month, more than 80 protesters occupied a rig operated by Shell
   contractors in neighbouring Delta state and 17 people were injured when
   soldiers opened fire.

   Journalists were later shown the graves of seven men who were
   reportedly shot dead in the incident, but the army denied that anyone
   was killed.

   Jarvis warns on refinancing deal

   A crew works on a railway line
   Criticism over its rail maintenance has dogged Jarvis

   Troubled engineering and construction group Jarvis has said that it
   faces a bleak future unless it completes a financial restructuring
   soon.

   Jarvis is urging shareholders to back a series of property sell-offs
   set to boost its coffers by around £25m.

   Failure to do so, it warned, would jeopardise the willingness of
   lenders to agree a refinancing deal.

   Emergency funds would be needed if no refinancing is agreed with
   lenders by the end of January, Jarvis said.

   "Such funding cannot be guaranteed, nor can its terms, which may be
   materially disadvantageous to shareholders," Jarvis said.

   "If such support were not forthcoming, the group would be unable to
   continue to trade."

   Sell-offs

   Jarvis is urging shareholders to back plans to sell-off five properties
   close to York railway station, the leasehold property at Jarvis House,
   York and 39 other interests.

   It also wants to raise cash through disposing of its stake in the
   London Underground Tube Lines consortium and by slimming down its
   accommodation services business.

   Jarvis's shares have lost about 90% in value since the start of 2004.
   The loss-making firm has faced criticism for some of its public sector
   contracts and was stripped this year of lucrative school building and
   road projects.

   Jarvis shares were off lows on Monday afternoon, but still traded 12%
   lower at 9.5 pence.

   eBay snaps up Rent.com for $415m

   eBay
   Started in 1995, eBay is now the world's biggest online marketplace

   Internet auction firm eBay has agreed to buy Rent.com for $415m (£214m)
   giving it access to more of the online property market.

   eBay will pay $385m in stocks and $30m in cash, with the deal set to be
   completed in the first quarter of 2005.

   It has been expanding both at home and abroad this year, and has bought
   into firms in South Korea and Germany.

   Rent.com, which helps users find flats as well as housemates, has
   annual sales of about $40m and was launched in 2001.

   "The acquisition will enable eBay to expand into a new segment of the
   online real estate market," the auction house said in a statement.

   It also will allow "Rent.com to continue to scale its business with the
   resources and expertise of eBay".

   The purchase is expected to have a slight effect on eBay's earnings
   next year, the company said.

   Following the success of the Vodafone Mobile Connect 3G data card and
   the introduction of initial 3G consumer services across eight European
   markets, the launch of Vodafone live! with 3G is the next significant
   step in Vodafone's 3G strategy.

   [Video3G.jpg]

   Launched in October 2002, Vodafone live! was the first mobile service
   to integrate handsets, networks, content and services to produce an end
   to end, easy to use customer proposition. Vodafone live! with 3G is the
   next generation of Vodafone's multi-media consumer offering. The
   customer experience is transformed by faster download speeds and
   improved quality of sound and images, encouraging increasing adoption
   and usage of Vodafone's services.

   Vodafone has also created a new, easy to understand pricing model. This
   model is designed to ensure customers receive simpler bills and to
   encourage usage through increased cost transparency. Content purchases
   will be charged on an event basis and browsing will be free or included
   in a highly attractive bundle of services. Customers will also be
   offered promotional bundles to promote the uptake of new Vodafone
   services. 3G voice propositions will offer more value for money to
   customers, with each Vodafone operating company offering market
   specific pricing plans.

   Arun Sarin, Chief Executive, Vodafone, said:

   "Today is an important day for Vodafone and the start of a new era in
   mobile communications.

   "Vodafone live! with 3G will dramatically change the way our customers
   experience their Vodafone services and we are confident that Vodafone
   live! with 3G will be a success. Customers want communication,
   organisation, entertainment and information on the move and they will
   increasingly turn to one device to deliver these needs – their mobile
   phone.

   "Vodafone live! with 3G will become increasingly mass market next year
   and we expect over 10 million customers to be using Vodafone live! with
   3G by March 2006 in our subsidiaries.

   "Vodafone live! with 3G provides Vodafone with a new platform for
   profitable growth. We are leaders in the evolution of mobile
   communications and we will continue to be at the forefront of
   innovation to the benefit of our customers and shareholders."

   Further detail on Vodafone live! with 3G

   The service proposition has several key, integrated elements:

   Handsets

   Vodafone will offer an initial, extensive range of 10 new 3G handsets
   for the Christmas period from Sharp, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, NEC,
   Nokia and Samsung. Seven of the handsets are exclusive to Vodafone and
   the range has been designed to offer a wide customer choice of high,
   mid and low tier priced 3G devices. Seven handsets from this range will
   be available in Japan, with nine available in Europe.

   Individual Vodafone operating companies have selected the most
   appropriate handsets for their local customer needs from this range.

   The handsets have been designed in close collaboration with Vodafone's
   manufacturing partners to ensure easy to use service delivery with the
   now improved Vodafone live! portal.

   Enhanced handset features now include:
   Better imaging capabilities: Europe's first 2 mega pixel camera phone
   Improved audio: stereo speakers, full track music download
   Expandable memory storage: 32MB provided as standard
   Portal

   Based on extensive customer feedback, the Vodafone live! with 3G portal
   has been significantly improved. Vodafone has made it even easier for
   customers to access services, enabling Vodafone live! with 3G to meet
   their needs quickly and intuitively. Customers can access the services
   that are important to them with fewer clicks and faster navigation.

   The portal now offers faster downloads of services and topical content
   which is updated at least on a daily basis. Promotions will sit at the
   top of the page to provide customers with the latest offers and most up
   to date information. An initial number of Vodafone markets will also
   offer a dynamic portal, which automatically configures customers'
   favourite content to the top of their home page, meaning they can get
   to the services they want faster. This function will be deployed across
   an increasing number of Vodafone markets in due course.

   Services and Content

   Vodafone live! with 3G delivers new services to customers including
   video calling, full track music download, 3D games and mobile TV.
   Current Vodafone live! services and content have been improved through
   better quality sound, pictures and video, including services such as
   video and picture messaging.

   Video Calling
   Video calling enables Vodafone customers to see and hear one another
   when making a call. With several handsets in the initial 3G range,
   Vodafone live! with 3G customers will be able to flip the camera view
   of the handset to allow the person they are calling to see what they
   are seeing.

   Picture and Video Messaging
   Picture messaging has been improved, with better quality pictures which
   can be sent to friends, family or colleagues direct to camera phones,
   e-mail or the Web.

   Customers can now take higher quality video messages due to the better
   camera resolutions of Vodafone live! with 3G handsets. The increased
   memory capabilities of Vodafone live! with 3G handsets allows customers
   to store more video and picture messages than ever before on their
   mobile phones.

   Full Track Music Download
   Music is a core offering of Vodafone live! with 3G. Customers can
   download full track music downloads to their handset and listen to near
   CD quality full music tracks, rather than small bursts of music through
   realtones or ring tones.

   Thousands of full track music downloads from some of the world's
   greatest artists have been secured through an extension of Vodafone's
   existing deal with Sony BMG Music Entertainment, as well as new
   agreements for music from the catalogues of EMI and Warner Music. An
   exciting selection of master recording ring tones ("realtones") is also
   available from artists signed to EMI, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and
   Universal Mobile.

   Customers will be able to download live performance videos from their
   favourite bands and stream award-winning programming clips like "Cribs"
   and "Dirty Sanchez" direct to their mobiles through Vodafone's
   multi-territory agreement with MTV.

   3D Games
   Vodafone live! with 3G takes mobile games to the next level with its
   VFX games engine. Not only will the catalogue of Vodafone favourites be
   more accessible than ever before, but the larger download capabilities
   of Vodafone's 3G network will offer even better graphics, sound and
   depth to its games content, providing customers with a much better
   games experience.

   The additional bandwidth of 3G also paves the way for high quality 3D
   games and Vodafone is introducing a range of branded titles at launch.
   These include a world mobile exclusive of the console smash hit "Crash
   Twinsanity" (Wonderphone/Vivendi Universal Games), Sega's "Super Real
   Tennis", stunning racing action with "Ferrari Experience 3D" and the
   downhill excitement of "Extreme Air Snowboarding" from Sumea/Digital
   Chocolate. Thrills of another kind are available in Superscape's "3D
   Evel-ution", based on the world-renowned stuntman, Evel Knievel.
   Another Sumea/Digital Chocolate produced Vodafone exclusive, and making
   its debut on mobile, is the fun and compelling, "Beach Minigolf".

   A selection of Vodafone live! with 3G launch handsets will feature
   embedded, limited-play trials and trailers of the above titles enabling
   customers to "try before you buy". The Vodafone live! with 3G portal
   will feature a full dynamic listing of the games charts, ensuring
   customers always have easy access to the most popular games.

   Mobile TV
   Customers in a number of countries will be able to catch up on their
   favourite television programmes by downloading or streaming video clips
   straight to their handsets. Customers will be able to view local and
   international sports, news, financial markets and other information and
   entertainment from leading brands.

   MobisodesTM
   With the signing of an exclusive deal with Twentieth Century Fox,
   Vodafone customers will be the first to experience a new generation of
   made-for-mobile TV and film content. For the first time, Vodafone
   customers will be able to go beyond the award winning drama series,
   "24", with a unique series inspired by the television blockbuster. Fans
   of "24" will be able to view twenty-four one minute mobisodes of "24:
   Conspiracy", which tracks a parallel plot of specially created
   characters inspired by the hit TV series.

   Film
   Each month, Vodafone live! with 3G will host a "Movie of the Month",
   enabling customers to view trailers and clips of the film, as well as
   to download associated animated greetings, picture messages, wallpapers
   and ringtones. The first "Movie of the Month" is "Bridget Jones: The

   Vodafone live! with 3G enables Vodafone to deliver breaking news
   directly to customers through streamed video, video clips and picture
   bulletins. Bigger video clips for longer news pieces can now be
   downloaded by customers from leading news providers such as ITN in the
   UK, N24 in Germany, Rai News in Italy and El Mundo in Spain.

   Pricing

   Vodafone has created new pricing which is designed to be simple to
   encourage usage.

   Vodafone live! with 3G customers will enjoy a new experience for buying
   content. Browsing will be free or included in a highly attractive
   bundle of services. Content purchases will now be charged on an event
   basis, rather than according to volume. The result is one simple line
   on the bill for all content charges relating to each download, enabling
   customers to easily track their purchases. In all markets Vodafone will
   be offering promotional packages designed to encourage adoption and
   trialling of new services.

   The new pricing model will also offer customers more value for money
   for voice services as Vodafone is able to benefit its customers from
   the additional capacity that 3G brings to its networks.

   Each Vodafone operating company will deliver pricing propositions
   tailored to the local needs of its customers based on these broad
   principles.

   Networks

   Core to the delivery of Vodafone live! with 3G are Vodafone's 3G
   networks. Vodafone has invested significantly to ensure its customers
   have 3G services of the highest quality. Vodafone customers will have
   seamless handover of voice and data services from 3G to 2G, ensuring
   high quality service delivery of Vodafone live! with 3G.

   Vodafone's strategy is to deploy 3G network coverage which delivers a
   high quality service within defined data usage areas and then enhance
   this coverage over time with carefully monitored customer demand and
   licence requirements.

   Vodafone's networks have been engineered to deliver a seamless voice,
   data and video calling roaming environment for a truly mobile service.
   Customers travelling within the 13 markets announced today will be able

Piper Rudnick to Merge With Big British Firm

   By Neil Irwin
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Monday, December 6, 2004; Page E01

   Piper Rudnick Gray Cary LLP, a law firm with major operations in
   Washington, agreed over the weekend to merge with British firm DLA LLP,
   creating one of the largest combinations ever of law firms from
   different countries.

   Officials of the firm, which is to be called DLA Piper Rudnick Gray
   Cary after the deal closes Jan. 1, say that by combining they will be
   able to better serve international clients. They acknowledge, though,
   that they will face a formidable challenge in merging two very large
   firms from different parts of the world, each with a distinct culture.

   "We felt the more places we can touch a client in meaningful ways, the
   better off we'd be," said Francis B. Burch Jr., a co-chairman of Piper
   Rudnick who is to be one of three joint chief executives of the
   combined firm. "There are some challenges. The integration challenge is
   the big one, getting as many of these 2,700 lawyers in 18 countries to
   work together as possible."

   DLA Piper will be the third-largest law firm in the world by number of
   lawyers in 2005, the companies say. The firms' combined 2003 revenue of
   $952 million would put DLA Piper in ninth place in a worldwide ranking
   of law firms published by American Lawyer magazine. Piper currently has
   only one office outside the United States.

   Piper has more than 500 employees in the Washington area, including 234
   lawyers and a large lobbying practice it obtained in part by acquiring
   D.C. firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand in 2002.
   Well-known members of its government affairs operation include former
   Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell and former House Republican
   leader Richard K. Armey.

   Each firm has about 1,350 lawyers, and there are no cities in which DLA
   and Piper both have offices. Burch said he does not expect any job cuts
   because of the merger. The only other international law-firm merger of
   comparable size was of British firm Clifford Chance, New York firm
   Rogers & Wells and German firm Punder, Volhard, Weber and Axster in
   2000, which created at the time a 2,700-lawyer firm that is now the
   world's largest. However, in that deal Clifford Chance was by far the
   larger partner, unlike the DLA-Piper Rudnick deal that is a merger of
   roughly equals.

   Other major law firms, such as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
   and Baker & McKenzie LLP, have offices around the world, but generally
   have built worldwide presence through small mergers and gradual
   expansion, rather than in a single transaction.

   Firms like Piper Rudnick are seeking an advantage over competitors by
   being a full-service firm that can offer big companies a wide range of
   legal services all over the world. As an example of the business that
   the merged DLA Piper will be able to win, Burch said Piper Rudnick's
   clients include a U.S.-based real estate investment firm that is
   planning major developments in seven different European nations. In the
   past, Piper would have lost the business advising the client on
   government relations and real estate law in those countries to
   competitors, but now it hopes to win much of that work through DLA
   partners.

   "The world is getting smaller and borders are becoming more porous from
   a business point of view," said Peter Zeughauser, a consultant who
   advises law firms on management, mergers, and other matters.
   (Zeughauser has done work for Piper Rudnick, but not on the DLA
   transaction). "Firms have to serve clients, and nearly all clients are
   doing business internationally today," he said.

   That's not to say it will be easy. International law-firm mergers are
   often complicated, given the differences in the legal cultures of
   various nations.

   A particularly nagging issue is compensation. British firms typically
   pay lawyers through a "lock-step" system based solely on seniority.
   U.S. firms generally use an "eat-what-you-kill" approach under which
   partners are paid based largely on business they bring in and hours
   they bill. Reconciling the two can be difficult in a merger. Burch said
   he believes that compensation issues will not be as difficult with the
   DLA merger as they have been in other transatlantic law-firm deals,
   because DLA already uses a system in which lawyers are paid partly
   based on the revenue they generate.

   Another problem is conflicts of interest. The combined firm will have
   to put in place systems to make sure that, for example, if it is
   defending a company in a big lawsuit, a partner in a different office
   doesn't try to bring in the plaintiff as a client for real estate work.

   "Conflicts of interest are a difficult problem," said Bradford W.
   Hildebrandt, chairman of the consultancy Hildebrandt International
   Inc., who helped engineer the Piper deal. "You have to have pretty
   sophisticated systems in place to keep you out of trouble."

   The deal is another step in a rapid ascent of Piper Rudnick to the top
   of the legal profession. In 1999, two mid-size law firms with little
   national profile merged -- Baltimore-based Piper & Marbury and
   Chicago-based Rudnick & Wolfe. In the five years since, through
   aggressive hiring and several large acquisitions, the firm has become
   one of a dozen or so full-service U.S. firms that can handle the full
   range of corporate legal work.

   DLA has a similar history. It has grown rapidly in the past five years,
   opening offices in 16 countries in Europe and Asia. It too specializes
   in general corporate work, finance, litigation, government relations,
   and real estate law.

   Lawyers from the two firms have worked together on projects in the past
   year to make sure they are a cultural fit. "We think we're pretty
   compatible," Burch said.

Krispy Kreme's Failings Tough To Glaze Over

   By Jerry Knight
   Monday, August 30, 2004; Page E01

   Investors are finally figuring out that Krispy Kreme Doughnuts' shares
   are just like its doughnuts: Get 'em while they're hot because they can
   go stale in a hurry.

   So stale, so fast that Krispy Kreme stock is now priced like the
   products in those old-bread outlets, selling Friday for a third of what
   it cost last summer, when Fortune magazine proclaimed Krispy Kreme "the
   hottest brand in America."

   Krispy Kreme was the second-best performing initial public offering of
   2000, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The price of the stock
   had jumped eightfold, to $44.59, by last summer, more than 50 times the
   profits the company earned last year.

   Last week, the stock hit an all-time low of $12.75 as Krispy Kreme was
   opening its first District store with a brilliantly conducted chorus of
   hype while offering not-so-sparkling explanations for a 56 percent
   plunge in second-quarter profits.

   Gasoline prices have gotten so high that people are no longer willing
   to drive to the doughnut shop, Krispy Kreme executives said in a
   conference call with investors Thursday. Executives also said gas
   prices were driving up the company's transportation costs and driving
   down profits.

   Doughnut sales in grocery stores are falling, too, because the
   supermarket chains that sell Krispy Kremes are losing shoppers to
   Wal-Mart, the company said. But Wal-Mart also sells Krispy Kremes in
   some of its stores.

   And the Atkins diet is causing people to give up doughnuts, they said,
   repeating an explanation they used when Krispy Kreme stock dove from
   $32 to $20 over three days in the spring.

   Thursday's announcement was a wake-up call to investors who've been
   enjoying the Krispy Kreme dream, so tastily described by Washington
   songwriter and former Post columnist Eric Brace:

   "She stood at my door

   With a bag from Krispy Kreme

Germany's New Reality

Layoffs by Automaker Confirm Labor's Diminishing Power

   By Peter S. Goodman and Petra Krischok
   Washington Post Foreign Service
   Friday, December 10, 2004; Page E01

   BOCHUM, Germany, Dec. 9 -- During much of Germany's postwar economic
   boom, as prosperity mounted and car sales multiplied, workers at the
   Opel automobile factory here became accustomed to getting their way:
   six weeks of vacation, a 35-hour week and some of the highest factory
   wages on earth. Whatever was left of that era ended on Thursday.

   Undercut by vastly cheaper labor in neighboring Poland and by
   increasing global competition, the union at Adam Opel AG acceded to a
   plan by General Motors Corp. to cut 12,000 jobs throughout Europe --
   10,000 of them in Germany and an estimated 4,000 at the Bochum plant
   alone. The job reductions will be voluntary, and GM, which owns the
   Opel, Saab and Vauxhall brands, is offering buyouts, early retirement
   and retraining worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for the most
   senior workers.
   Hans Gabriel, a worker at the Opel automobile factory in Bochum,
   Germany, joined fellow employees in a five-day strike in October.

   Though geared to help GM rebound from its global slide in the auto
   market -- the company has not been profitable in Europe since 1999 and
   expects to save $665 million a year through the jobs cuts -- the deal
   underscores the extent to which globalization has torn at the social
   consensus governing Germany and much of Western Europe.

   Rigid labor rules are blamed for European unemployment rates stuck
   around 9 percent, compared with less than 6 percent in the United
   States. Economic growth has also lagged, and labor-market reform is
   cited by many economists as an important step toward changing that.

   When Opel workers went on strike for five days in October, it was clear
   how times were changing. They went back to work with nothing more than
   the promise of talks and the lingering threat that many of the Bochum
   plant's 9,600 jobs would be shifted to Poland, where labor costs about
   $4.70 an hour, compared with $29 an hour here.

   "It's not negotiations, what's happening now," said Peter Jaszczyk, who
   worked at the Opel plant for 40 years and formerly headed the worker's
   council. "Management is just dictating conditions. The union doesn't
   have the power anymore."

   [labor_121004.gif]
   Around the world, labor is grappling with the impact of capital flowing
   to lower-cost countries. Textile workers in Mexico are losing ground to
   China; software engineers in the Silicon Valley succumb to skilled
   counterparts in India. The changes in Western Europe have been
   particularly wrenching because labor has occupied such a powerful perch
   for much of modern times -- one that has, until recently, cushioned
   against the restructuring and layoffs that have occurred elsewhere.

   Now, labor in Europe's wealthiest countries is reeling as capital flows
   eastward. Investment is pouring in to new members of the European Union
   such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, where workers earn
   roughly one-sixth what they do in Germany and France, and farther away
   to still cheaper Romania, Turkey and China. Unions once accustomed to
   wage increases and sweetened bonuses submit to slashed pay and benefits
   in a desperate bid to keep jobs.

   In Germany -- still struggling to integrate its wealthier western half
   with the formerly communist east -- the export of jobs is exacerbating
   an unemployment crisis. More than 4 million people are out of work, and
   unemployment is 10 percent.

   A recent survey conducted by the economist Horst Wildemann found that 6
   in 10 German companies were preparing to establish a manufacturing base
   outside the country in the next four years. That could cost as many as
   400,000 jobs a year. A similar study by the Boston Consulting Group
   found that transfers of work abroad could eliminate one-fourth of
   Germany's industrial workforce by 2015, wiping out 2 million jobs.

Online Dating's Creep Factor

   By Alyce Lomax (TMF Lomax) | More Articles
   August 24, 2004 | Comments (1)

   MatchNet's recent IPO filing, star-crossed as it may have been, hinted
   at what I have suspected for some time: Online dating, once viewed as
   the realm for losers and geeks, has become a regular part of Internet
   social life -- and another type of content Netizens will pay for.

   Strong trends cue explosive growth, like the fireworks that started
   "Love, American Style" off with a bang. High-speed broadband and
   muscular new computers ease clicking through pages of profiles.
   Increased transience and demanding schedules make it hard for singles,
   and the bar scene gets old. Moderns get married later, leaving lots of
   time for dating around. Last, our woefully high U.S. divorce rate
   leaves many re-released into the field.

   There's proof in the numbers. According to Jupiter's Internet research,
   online dating is expected to grow by 60% to $642 million by 2008. As it
   stands now, two out of five singles have tried it.

   MatchNet may have withdrawn its IPO filing, citing the "faltering"
   climate for Internet IPOs (despite Google), but it contained good info
   on the industry. There are 86 million single American adults. According
   to the Online Publishers Association, online dating was the No. 1
   segment of content purchased online this year, growing 49% to $450
   million.

   MatchNet -- the name behind JDate, American Singles, and several others
   -- would have been the first publicly traded online dating pure play in
   the U.S. There are likely plenty of investors waiting to get in on the
   action, since the other companies in the space are either private or
   simply pieces of larger publicly traded entities. Is there reason to
   weep over what might have been? Probably not. Let's not forget, with
   starry-eyed romance comes risk.

   Love in all the wrong places?
   Since 1999, MatchNet's sales have grown 460% to $36.9 million,
   mirroring the upward trajectory of online dating. Last year, its net
   revenues increased 125%, with a 61% increase in "active members" and a
   138% boost in paying subscribers.

   However, MatchNet also disclosed a sharply wider net loss for the year
   -- $10.9 million, or $0.57 per share, from a loss of $0.5 million, or
   $0.03 per share the year before. Revenue per subscriber decreased by
   17%, while subscriber churn increased by a few percentage points.

   The company's swelling expenses are largely a result of increased
   marketing costs -- up 233% last year -- because of competition. Partial
   justification for the IPO was to fund additional marketing and
   advertising.

   Then there was the little disclosure that MatchNet's co-chairmen
   received 265% bonus increases in 2003, giving each a $1.4 million
   payout -- in my opinion, overly lavish compensation for a company
   poised to drum up public funds.

   An IPO withdrawn just eight days after filing gave me the creeps.
   MatchNet's press announcement also disclosed the resignation of CEO
   Todd Tappin (formerly of Overture and News Corp. (NYSE: NWS  ) ), who
   has been on board since only February, and the fact that it now plans
   to cut 40 positions to trim costs.

   Love competition
   Regardless of how investors might yearn for a slice of the online
   dating pie, there's tough company. The big brands include
   IAC/InterActiveCorp's (Nasdaq: IACI  ) Match.com, as well as Yahoo!
   (Nasdaq: YHOO  ) Personals. Privately held Spring Street targets
   hipsters through sites such as sexy Nerve.com and my favorite humor
   site, The Onion.

   Social networking sites have served many of the same hook-up purposes,
   free of charge, though Friendster seemed to lose momentum once Internet
   denizens saw how "connected" they were (and how slow the site was!).

   Bulletin board site Craigslist quietly turned into a hip way to meet
   romantic prospects. (It's free, but it recently added New York and Los
   Angeles to San Francisco as cities for which it charges for employment
   ads, as it, too, is funding expansion.) Orkut is a social networking
   site still in beta and loosely affiliated with Google. InterActive is
   planning its own foray into social networking (which certainly could
   have some synergistic relationship with Match).

   Social networkers likely changed the fee-based Internet dating space.
   Instead of being a virtual "meet market," there seems to be demand for
   complex psychological profiles, a valuable differentiation from offline
   personal ads or social networking -- enter eHarmony and True.com.

   In fact, eHarmony shook Match up with its claims of compatibility
   accuracy and resulting successful marriages (indeed, eHarmony patented
   its formula); Match now offers compatibility profiling as well.

   Fear factor
   Another hurdle -- indeed, risk to the effectiveness of the sites -- is
   quality of users. Credibility is a serious concern in the industry, and
   any highly publicized dirty dealings could result in a PR nightmare for
   any of the players.

   Males tend to complain about "false advertising," such as old photos.
   (Match.com supposedly may offer a service to "certify" photographs.)

   Women, on the other hand, complain about married or unavailable men
   preying on single females. That's how True.com goes for rivals'
   jugulars. "Warning: Married people need not apply," the site says,
   adding that such an act constitutes fraud and it can nail people for
   it. True.com also offers background checks to protect users from creepy
   criminal types.

   So, True already capitalizes on one major barrier to widespread
   consumer adoption -- those paranoid of "stranger danger."

   All's fair in love and price wars
   There's also a lack of pricing stability. Already, Match, which seems
   to have service plans that charge anywhere between $19.95 to $29.95
   depending on its latest whim, is contending with formidable foes such
   as eHarmony, which bills a whopping $49.95 introductory premium. (Maybe
   it should be called "eHarmoney.") However, True sees opportunity in the
   middle ground, charging $29.99 for a month.

   It's likely perceived that people will pay more for real "matching,"
   which eHarmony and True both claim to provide. Hold your criticism:
   many users probably feel the higher prices insinuate users who are more
   serious about "real relationships."

   eHarmony picks specific "matches" (which can be few and far between)
   using its complex profiling. The emphasis on "quality, not quantity,"
   and its four-step program of anonymous communication before "open
   communication," represents a departure from Match, through which users
   post profiles and then get flooded by the messaging masses.

   JDate, MatchNet's most popular site, sits at the high end of the
   spectrum, at $34.95 per month for its targeted, niche offering, while
   its AmericanSingles service is $24.95.

   However, many of the sites now feature lowered fees for
   commitment-phobic, serial-dater customers. (I couldn't resist. What I
   mean is, customers who commit to more than one month of the service.)
   That, of course, digs right into the top line.

   Cold feet?
   Not to mention, there are intrinsic challenges, including continued
   industry evolution.

   A recent Wired article showed there are already hackers and geeks
   monkeying around with online dating, even one guy who wants to use
   Google as a dating platform. (I joked about "Google Dates" a while
   back, but I can imagine some possibilities, such as text-related ads
   for activities that key off common interests.) There will be no resting
   on laurels. The name of the game will be "innovate."

   Ultimately, the marketing implies that singles will meet their matches
   (and get out of the game). For the services, it's sort of "damned if
   you do, damned if you don't." They need success stories -- and to make
   sure that users don't burn out or get burned -- to survive.

   With the current emphasis evolving from speed dating and buffet-style
   trolling to one of true "matching" based on compatibility and a desire
   to find "The One," financial success may become a paradox. As long as
   love exists and the industry evolves, maybe there's only so far any of
   the services can go.

   So, if MatchNet decides to revive its scuttled IPO filing later -- or
   if the other privately held contenders decide to go public themselves
   -- my advice would be: Look out, investors; when it comes to this
   industry, you may have to kiss a lot of toads.

   Alyce Lomax does not own shares of any of the companies mentioned,
   though she'd like to point out that the Fool pulled a rather prescient
   April Fool's Day prank in 2002, before she worked there. Did she fall
   for it? Naaaaah. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Make Your Lender Tell the Truth

   By Dayana Yochim | More Articles
   August 24, 2004 | Comments (1)

   Occasionally, things slide. Like, for instance, this column, which was
   due in my editor's inbox yesterday. Thankfully this blunder will not
   turn up on my credit report. But other indiscretions -- such as that
   credit card bill that hid in the bottom of my purse for 30 days in June
   1998 -- can leave a mark. That one will finally be wiped from my record
   next year.

   There are two kinds of credit report blunders -- information that's
   outright inaccurate and boo-boos that reflect the errors of your ways.
   There's no denying self-inflicted credit record wounds (though you can
   try, and you might be successful if you catch the credit reporting
   agency on a good day). But what do you do when First Bank of Firstness
   is reporting lies to potential lenders?

   As I pointed out last week, there's a pretty good chance that your
   credit report is not a 100% accurate reflection of your money-handling
   history. The severity of the slipups can range from the rather innocent
   (such as misspelling your name) to the extreme (one Detroit man was
   notified by his lender that he was being reported as dead). Most
   inaccuracies fall in the rather mundane category of "late payments,"
   which you'll find described as 30, 60, or 90 days past due.

   When your punctuality is wrongly called into question, there's only one
   thing to do: Clear your good name. If you're lucky, it will take only
   one phone call and one letter to set the record straight.

   Dear Lender: You Are Wrong
   When you find inaccurately reported information on your credit report,
   you can dispute it with the credit reporting agency or go straight to
   your friendly misinformed lender. You'll probably be best served by
   dealing with the latter, because the bureaus report only what they are
   given by your creditors.

   Your fact-finding mission includes two steps:

   1. Call the creditor who's reporting incorrect information and get the
   full name, job title, department name, telephone number, and address of
   the person who is charged with handling your dispute. Be polite, if
   only to earn a few karma points.

   2. Gather proof. You'll need to verify your claim of inaccurate
   information. Proof is anything from canceled payment checks to past
   billing statements. If your statement filing system isn't up to snuff,
   you'll need to get past account statements to support your claim. Lucky
   for you, the Fair Credit Billing Act requires the creditor to keep your
   past statements on file so that you can access them. Yes, you'll
   probably have to pay for it. Call the billing or records department of
   your creditor and ask for what you need.

   Now it's time to compose your "Dear Lender" letter.

   If the information you are disputing is truly inaccurate or incomplete,
   almost all of the inaccuracies can be corrected with a single letter.
   Compose a brief note describing the mistake you've found and request
   that the item be corrected. Enclose copies of any supporting
   documentation. Use any leverage you might have as an ongoing customer
   of the offending business. Here's a sample letter based on one found at
   creditinsiders.com:

   Your Name
   Your Address
   Your City, State, Zip Code
   Social Security Number

   Complaint Department
   Name of Creditor
   Address
   City, State, Zip Code

   Dear [contact name]:

   I am writing to dispute the following information that you have been
   reporting to [name of credit reporting agency]. [List the
   inaccuracies.]

   This item is (inaccurate or incomplete) because [describe what is
   inaccurate or incomplete and why]. I am requesting that the item be
   deleted [or request another specific change] to correct the
   information.

   Enclosed are copies of [use this sentence if applicable and describe
   any enclosed documentation, such as payment records or court documents]
   supporting my position. Please reinvestigate this (these) matter(s) and
   (delete or correct) the disputed item(s) as soon as possible. I also
   request that you notify each of the consumer reporting agencies you
   report to that this particular notation is in dispute.

   Sincerely,

   Your name
   Your signature

   Enclosures: (List what you are enclosing)

   If your dispute results in a change to your credit report, the credit
   bureau will give you the written results and a free copy of your
   report. While this marks the end of most disputes, be aware that the
   information can show up again. That will occur only if the creditor
   verifies the disputed item's accuracy and completeness. If that
   happens, you'll receive notice from the credit bureau, and you can take
   it from there. Again.

   What if the error is not resolved within 30 days? It's time to break
   out the legal eagle dictionary and a little attitude. Make it clear
   that you know the Fair Credit Reporting Act laws and are serious about
   your wishes. (For some bedtime reading, print out the document and
   highlight the juicy parts.) This will require another phone call, and,
   again, please be civil. Call your lender and get the name of someone in
   its legal department. Send your letter to the company's lawyers and
   your original contact in the disputes department. Here's a sample
   lawyered-up note penned by a longtime Fool:

   Your Name
   Your Address
   Your City, State, Zip Code
   Social Security Number

   Name of Creditor
   Address
   City, State, Zip Code
   To [contact name]:

   I am formally requesting that you validate all tradeline notations you
   have submitted to the three major credit reporting agencies by [name of
   original creditor] for me, [your name], for account number XXXXXXXXX.

   Due to possible inaccuracies in these credit reporting agency reports,
   I must demand that the validation I hereby lawfully request be in the
   form of a notarized statement by a person with original knowledge of
   the debt as it was constituted and who can testify that the debt was
   incurred legally, was not subsequently disputed as a result of
   returned, faulty, or recalled consumer products, was not utilized as a
   profit-loss tax deduction during the period it may have been payable,
   and was not claimed as a loss with any insuring entity during the
   period it may have been payable. Please be advised that I am not
   requesting a verification that you have my mailing address; rather, I
   am requesting validation, i.e., competent evidence that I had some
   contractual obligation sans consumer protection encumbrance which
   incurred the original claims associated with this tradeline.

   I have enclosed two documents which will verify my address: a photocopy
   of a [your state] driver's license and a photocopy of a recent [name of
   utility or telephone company] statement.

   Please know that you have 30 days from the tracked and confirmed
   delivery of this lawful notice to either answer these demands or to
   remove the associated negative tradeline notations from the CRA
   reports. Any other action may constitute evidence of your intent to
   abridge one or more civil or other constitutional rights. Please be
   further advised that continued unsubstantiated reporting of possible
   inaccuracies to third parties may provide a basis for criminal
   complaints being filed in accordance with FDCPA, FCRA, and other
   federal statutes.

   I look forward to a timely and amicable resolution to this matter.

   Sincerely yours,

   Your Name
   Enclosures [list enclosures, same as first letter.]
   CC - [Legal contact]

   I haven't got a clue what half of that means, either. But apparently it
   gets the job done.

   If your creditors disagree with your claim, they will likely explain
   why the information is accurate. Either they will be correct in their
   explanation (and you just have a really bad memory), or they somehow
   misunderstood your dispute, in which case another letter may be
   necessary.

   Hopefully one of the letters to your original creditor, along with your
   proper documentation, will settle any disputes of inaccurate
   information. In the event they don't, however, you may need to actually
   pursue legal action. (Your state's attorney general's office can help
   you locate a lawyer who will advise you on taking a creditor to court.)

   If you are unsuccessful in removing information from your credit file
   and reach an impasse, you always have the legal right to attach a
   letter of explanation to your credit file. Be sure to cover all three
   of the major credit bureaus as well as the offending business. The
   business is obligated to include your letter in any future input to the
   credit bureaus. Verify that it does.

   And remember, it could be worse. At least your lender knows (and
   reports) you're alive.

Apple Is Rotten

   By Seth Jayson (TMF Bent) | More Articles
   October 7, 2004 | Comments (1)

   This week we're dueling over the prospects of one of our most popular
   stocks here at Fool.com: Apple Computer. Loved by many, hated by just
   as many, Apple separates Fool from Fool frequently in our discussion
   boards. We take the battle to the front page today with Fool
   contributor and Mac aficionado Tim Beyers defending the iEmpire while
   Fool Seth Jayson argues that Apple is rotten to the core. After you've
   read both sides, vote on which one has won your heart.

   Ladies and gentlemen, the Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL  ) is rotten. OK, let's
   qualify that. After all, this is to be a discussion -- for the most
   part -- about Apple the company, not Apple technology. Apple's stock is
   overripe. Stinking. Mealy, full of worms, and wholly unsuitable for
   public consumption. Why? Shortsighted enthusiasm.

   No doubt about it, Apple the brand is hot. Over the past couple of
   years, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a huge margin. There's
   a one-word reason: iPod. The world's best-known digital-music doodad
   has juiced Apple's sales over the past several quarters and made the
   company the latest shoeshine-boy stock. What's a shoeshine-boy stock?
   Something like Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD  ) before it found out that
   reality bites. It's the popular company, the one that gets free press
   coverage with every new retail outlet, the stock everyone's telling you
   to buy. And as Lynch and others have pointed out, when the
   wingtip-buffing ragamuffins recommend an equity, that's a pretty sure
   sign that the hot streak will be coming to an end.

   But the shoeshine-boy syndrome isn't the only symptom of Apple's
   upcoming malaise. There are others, clearly visible in the financials.
   Why no one seems to notice the obvious is another story, and,
   conveniently enough, that's the one we'll explore first.

   Think different, like me!
   "Think different?" I've always found this key slogan in Apple's
   marketing to be troubling, and not just because it shows that CEO Steve
   Jobs needs to brush up on his fifth-grade grammar. (Hey Stev-o, buy
   yourself an adverb!) It's creepy and ironic because Mac fans --
   especially the ones who write me -- are about as freethinking as the
   lovely ladies of Stepford. They're like a pack of Moonies telling a
   congregation of Snakehandlers, "You're brainwashed. Join us to free
   your mind."

   Americans have always preferred their rebellion in commercialized and
   socially acceptable packages -- witness GM's Hummer H2, Harley Davidson
   motorcycles, or the Mullet -- but wake up, people! Leaving a $300
   billion monopoly to support a $15 billion one does not constitute
   intellectual daring.

   In fact, it simply means you've got less consumer freedom, not more.
   Think I'm making this up? Ha! Count the PC vs. Mac software packages at
   your neighborhood Best Buy. Try using your iPod with competing
   software. Try using any non-Apple MP3 player with iTunes. This is more
   than a question of tech theology: Mac's legendary insularity has always
   been a huge anchor on growth.

   Apple's iTunes and iPod are the biggest things in digital music today,
   and Jobs and Co. are determined to screw it up. Why? They think
   different, all right. By refusing to play nicely with outfits such as
   RealNetworks (Nasdaq: RNWK  ) , Roxio (Nasdaq: ROXI  ) , and Loudeye
   (Nasdaq: LOUD  ) , Apple's not only passing up lucrative licensing
   opportunities but also missing the chance to rocket to the front of the
   digital music world forever.

   Taking measured steps toward dominating a market is how Microsoft
   (Nasdaq: MSFT  ) came to be 20 times bigger than Apple. As things
   stand, Apple's congenital narrow-mindedness makes it easy pickings for
   the dozens of dit-music firms out there who want to take a bite out of
   Cupertino. Just because none of them have come up with anything as
   nifty as the iPod doesn't mean they won't. Low-margin iTunes is already
   under threat.

   But surely Apple's management realizes this fatal error, right? Don't
   count on it.

   Hey, Emperor! Nice duds!
   The end result of the overdone enthusiasm for Apple is a major lack of
   accountability. I've worked with Macs for well more than a decade, and
   though they've gotten more stylish, they haven't necessarily gotten any
   better, especially compared with the competition.

   Consider the photo and design audience. For years Apple has been
   milking its reputation as the computer of choice for this constituency.
   There was a time when Macs had a lead that looked insurmountable.
   That's no longer the case.

   Every year I get to play with brand new Mac gear -- direct from Apple
   -- as the "tech guy" at a well-known photojournalism workshop. This
   year, as usual, I wasted entire days trying to coax the new Mac OS to
   make nice with a variety of printers. Plug and play? Try plug and pray.
   Color fidelity, WYSWYG? Not with top-of-the-line Power Macs and cinema
   displays, I guess. This year, incredibly, I ended up relying on a
   no-name Windows laptop purchased at Wal-Mart's Sam's Club to do the
   heavy lifting.

   I'm not surprised, because I've seen this for years. But here's the odd
   thing: Even though the diehard Mac fans (everyone there) were cursing
   the quality of the machines and the OS, they remain Mac fans. They've
   made a lifestyle choice, and they're sticking with it. But their
   sheepish acceptance of the frustrating state of affairs is another drag
   on Mac growth. There's no need to improve when all you hear is how
   great you already are.

   Stockholders should realize that when you're fighting for turf on the
   open market, style goes only so far. To judge by the public's lukewarm
   response to Mac computers over the past few years, Apple's not so
   efficient with the proselytizing. For 2002 and 2003, total Macintosh
   unit sales have been either flat or negative. So far this year, they're
   doing better, up 10%. Sound good? Dell's (Nasdaq: DELL  ) unit growth
   is 50% better, at 15%. And industry observers have recently started to
   wonder whether the late launch of the new iMac and limited availability
   of the new PowerMacs will rein in Apple's slimmer scale-up. Outside the
   iPod, Mac is definitely not a quick grower, so what's up with the stock
   price?

   Two-bit Apple
   Apple is one of those companies where investors are enthusiasts, and
   vice-versa. Sometimes, that's OK. But in this case, the result is a
   self-deluding, self-amplifying feedback loop. Earlier this year, there
   was reason to cheer the iPod's contribution to the top line. But these
   days, it's nearly impossible to hear through noisy enthusiasm.

   The cacophonous refrain these days is the claim -- so far
   unsubstantiated -- that the iPod will increase demand for the company's
   computers. Over the past few days, the Macintosh media have repeated
   this contention, pointing to a single analyst's pie-in-the-sky wish for
   an increase in Macintosh market share. Here's what was actually
   written: A .5% increase in market share is "not out of the question."

   Not out of the question?

   Listen, a visit to my back yard from people-probing Martians is also
   not out of the question, but that doesn't mean you should bet your
   investing dollars on the likelihood. How about looking at the numbers
   instead? Yes, let's.

   To start with the obvious, Apple's price to earnings ratio (P/E), we
   find a 73. Yikes! The forward P/E, based on estimates, clocks in at 43.
   Though it is a mistake to judge a company only by its P/E ratio, the
   fact that Apple's is more than twice its competitors' demands some
   explaining.

   Hey, Apple is growing, right? So, when we account for Apple's likely
   rate of expansion, is the stock's price more solid ground? Hardly. When
   you compare the P/E to expected growth, through the PEG ratio, Apple's
   stock looks even crazier. Apple's PEG is an insane 3.36.

   Yes, the PEG is a bit old-school, but it's still a good rule of thumb.
   When paying up for growth, you should start getting skeptical when the
   P/E exceeds the rate of growth. When they're in balance, the PEG sits
   around 1. You could argue that Apple's explosive earnings increase over
   the past year has put this metric out of whack, but even if you don't
   believe in absolutes, taking a look at Apple's peers provides a good
   dose of reality. Dell's PEG is 1.37. Hewlett-Packard's, 1.45. Even
   Google's 2.38 is an order of magnitude lower.

   OK, we're still talking about valuation shorthand here. Certainly there
   must be some other reason that people are paying such a premium for
   Apple. Could it be superior margins? Nope, Apple's operating margins of
   3% are pathetic by industry standards. Those are the kind of margins
   you see in cut-rate retail businesses -- 2% lower than Wal-Mart's! What
   that means is that Apple is going to have a tough time continuing to
   club earnings out of the park, even if it can scare up big sales gains.
   To see what a profitable tech firm should be achieving, look at Dell's
   8.5% operating margins, or Microsoft's 24%.

   C'mon, there must be something! How about major products in
   development? Nothing so far. In fact, one of the few analysts brave
   enough to put a "hold" on Apple recently was practically begging the
   firm to come up with anything new. A flash-RAM iPod, a set-top box, a
   media PC, anything. When the analysts start pleading for a reason to
   stay bullish on the Street's favorite pet rock, it's time for savvy
   shareholders to look for the exits.

   The final word
   Friends -- and by friends, I mean those of you out there furiously
   typing angry defenses of Apple -- open your eyes. Enthusiasm for a
   computer, pocket stereo, or cleverly marketed lifestyle choice is no
   reason for an investment. Apple's done well over the past two years,
   but the stock is now priced beyond perfection. For your $40 a stub, you
   should be getting an unstoppable business with huge growth potential.
   Instead, you're getting a slowing, sub-par nerd-niche operator with a
   shiny surface. To add insult to injury, 47% of the stockholders
   earnings so far this year are wiped when you consider the impact of
   stock options. Where's the payback for shareholders?

   They wax and polish the mealy apples at the supermarket in order to
   fool you into buying them. Don't fall for the same trick when you're
   buying stocks.

   Wall Street stocks gain as oil prices retreat from their highs
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-10-19 07:46:07

       NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (Xinhuanet) -- Wall Street stocks traded higher
   Monday as investors got a modest relief after the crude oil prices
   declined from their new highs above 55 dollars per barrel.

       The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.94 points, or 0.23
   percent, to 9,956.32 points. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 25.02
   points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,936.52 points. The Standard & Poor's 500
   index gained 5.82 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,114.02 points.

       On Monday, the Nymex crude oil futures fell 1.26 dollars to endat
   53.67 dollars after reaching 55.33 dollars before the session.
   Investors who had sold stocks for months as oil prices climbed reversed
   course and started buying as the price of crude declined.The good news
   about oil also helped investors overcome the disappointing sentiment
   over 3M Co.'s earnings, which missed market's expectations as the
   company lowered its full-year outlook.

       3M Co. fell 1.88 dollars to 76.10 dollars after a 17 percent rise
   in earnings still missed Wall Street forecasts and as the company
   lowered its full-year earnings outlook.

       Other decliners included toy makers Mattel Inc. and Hasbro
   Inc.Mattel Inc. declined 47 cents to 17.50 dollars, while Hasbro Inc.
   lost 1.20 dollars to 17.26 dollars after the two companies posted weak
   earnings for the third quarter.

       However, Pfizer Inc. rose 50 cents to 29 dollars after the
   drugmanufacturer said it would conduct additional scientific studies on
   its Celebrex arthritis drug, and Pfizer's rival Merck & Co. also rose
   40 cents to 30.90 dollars after the company withdrew itsVioxx drug from
   the market last month.

       On the NYSE, advancing stocks outnumbered decliners and the trading
   volume came to 1.71 billion shares. Enditem

        BEIJING, Nov. 9 (Xinhuanet) -- Microsoft announced on Monday it
   would pay $536 million to its smaller rival Novell to settle an
   antitrust suit and resolve a 10-year dispute with a computer trade
   group.

       Novell claimed that Microsoft used the Windows operating system's
   dominant market position to harm its Netware network software business.

       Microsoft also reached a deal with the Computer & Communications
   Industry Association (CCIA) under which the trade group agreed not to
   seek a review by the US Supreme Court in its challenge to a lower
   court's final judgment in the US government's antitrust case against
   Microsoft.

       The settlement will reduce the company's recently reported first
   fiscal quarter profit by 13 per cent to $2.53 billion, or 23 cents per
   share, Washington-based Microsoft said. Enditem

   US Fed boosts key rate to 2.25 percent [typk.jpg]
   www.chinaview.cn 2004-12-15 07:31:59

       WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 (Xinhuanet) -- US Federal Reserve decided
   Tuesday to raise the federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge
   each other on overnight loans, by one-quarter percentage point to 2.25
   percent from 2 percent.

   Clerks in the Euro Dollar pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange react
     to the U.S. Federal Reserve Banks decision to raise interest rates,
       December 14. The Fed raised U.S. interest rates on Tuesday by a
   quarter-percentage point for the fifth time this year and said it will
     gradually keep lifting them from rock-bottom levels as the economy
                                   grows.

   December 14. The Fed raised U.S. interest rates on Tuesday by a
   quarter-percentage point for the fifth time this year and said it will
   gradually keep lifting them from rock-bottom levels as the economy
   grows.  (Xinhua/Reuters)

       The decision was made by the central bank's policy-making body, the
   Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC), at its final regular meeting this
   year. This was the fifth consecutive rate increase since June 2004,
   when the key short-term interest rate stood at a 46-year low of one
   percent.

       The federal funds rate is the Fed's main tool for influencing
   economic activity. As a result of Tuesday's action, commercial banks
   were expected to increase their prime lending rate to 5.25 percent from
   5 percent.

       The prime lending rate, the benchmark for many short-term consumer
   and business loans, moves in lockstep with the federal funds rate.

       "The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of
   monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust
   underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to
   economic activity," the FOMC said in a statement after the meeting.

       Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier
   rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve
   gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well
   contained, said the statement.

       It said "the Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to
   the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the
   next few quarters to be roughly equal."

       "With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the
   Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace
   that is likely to be measured."

       Nonetheless, "the Committee will respond to changes in economic
   prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price
   stability," it said.

       In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a quarter
   percentage point increase in the discount rate to 3.25 percent,
   according to the statement.

       In June this year, the Fed ordered its first rate increase in four
   years, raising the federal funds rate to 1.25 percent from one percent.
   Since then, it has boosted rates five times with each move by a
   one-quarter point.

       The FOMC is scheduled to meet eight times in 2005. The first one is
   Feb.1-2. Enditem

       MOSCOW, Dec. 17 (Xinhuanet) -- Russia's Federal Property Fund said
   Friday it will go ahead with an auction of the embattled Yukos oil
   giant's major unit Yuganskneftegaz despite a US court decision to halt
   the sale, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

       "We are a specialized state agency and act according to Russian
   law," spokesman of the agency Alexander Komarov said.

       "We are selling Yugansk by order of a bailiff and so far we haven't
   received any order to cancel the auction. Therefore, we are still
   planning to continue," the spokesman said.

       Under the US court decision, the auction should be held off for 10
   days. A Moscow court source had said that the decision would have no
   legal consequence in Russia.

       "Russia does not have any accords with the United States that would
   allow one side even theoretically to influence such processes on the
   territory of the other," said an unnamed high-ranking official with the
   Moscow Arbitration Court, which is judging a number of cases concerning
   Yukos.

       The auction was ordered by the Russian authorities in July after
   the heavily indebted oil giant failed to pay 99.4 billion rubles (about
   3.6 billion US dollars) in unpaid tax for the year 2000 and other fees.

       Many critics see the judicial investigation of Yukos as a
   Kremlin-inspired onslaught against Yukos, which had sponsored political
   opponents against Russian President Vladimir Putin.

       The Russian leadership denies the allegation, saying that the case
   was part of the country's anti-corruption campaign. Enditem

   US court orders halt to auction of Yukos main unit

       WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 (Xinhuanet) -- A US bankruptcy judge on late
   Thursday issued a temporary injunction to block this weekend's sale of
   Yuganskneftegaz, the main production subsidiary of embattled Russian
   oil giant Yukos.

     &nbsp; "Participants in international commerce, in Russia, in the
   United States and elsewhere, need to have an expectation that whenthey
   invest in foreign enterprises they may do so without fear that their
   investments may be the subject of confiscatory action by agencies of
   the foreign government," US Bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark wrote in her
   ruling.

       Yukos, which said both the main business of the company and
   theCFO's office are in the United States, and thus they made the filing
   here, now has 10 business days to seek a permanent injunction.

       It welcomed the court's ruling, saying that although the Russian
   government may not halt the auction, it hoped the international banks
   will adhere to the ruling. The banks include Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro,
   BNP Paribas, Calyon, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and J.P. Morgan.

       The auction was ordered by the Russian authorities in July after
   the heavily indebted oil giant failed to pay 99.4 billion rubles (about
   3.6 billion dollars) in unpaid tax for 2000 and other fees.

       "Our hope would be the banks that were part of this would respect
   US law and maybe deny the funds for the sale," said Yukos spokesman
   Mike Lake.

       The company has called the filing its last try to avoid the auction
   of Yuganskneftegaz, ordered by the Russian government in the ongoing
   dispute with Yukos over 28 billion US dollars in back tax payments.

       Yukos has also asked Clark to order arbitration proceedings between
   Yukos and the Russian government to enable the company's reorganization
   and emergence from bankruptcy. Clark has yet to address that issue.

       The private holding Yukos accounts for 10 percent of Russia's oil
   output and 18 percent of its crude export.

       In October 2003, Yukos' former chief, Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
   wasarrested on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Enditem

                   Microsoft increases entertainment focus
                                 (Agencies)
                          Updated: 2004-10-13 13:46

             Microsoft Corp. unveiled the latest version of its
      entertainment-focused operating system Tuesday, seeking a broader
      audience on a wider array of computers and stoked by partnerships
               offering music, movies and even recorded books.

    Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, who showed off Windows XP Media Center
       Edition in Hollywood Tuesday, called the third version "a major
   milestone" but stressed it is still a long-term venture for Microsoft.

    Microsoft chairman and chief software architect Bill Gates listens to
    music as a display of the selections is shown on an HP display screen
   during a demonstration of the Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition
     2005 at the Digital Entertainment Anywhere launch event held in Los
    Angeles, October 12, 2004. Gates showcased a variety of new computer
      designs, portable media devices and digital content services from
    Microsoft's industry partners, demonstrating a breadth of choice for
       how people can now enjoy many types of entertainment. [Reuters]
   "This is something where you have to be willing to invest like we have
    over a number of years and really listen to the customers, build the
                 partnerships," he said prior to the event.

       Gates said the company plans to put more money and effort into
    marketing the new version of Media Center, particularly to mainstream
   users. "This is where we've decided to really raise the noise level up
                        quite dramatically," he said.

   Microsoft has offered versions of the Media Center system, which allows
    people to watch and record live television, listen to music and DVDs,
   and view digital photos, for about two years. More people are using PCs
                as entertainment hubs in their living rooms.

      Microsoft says it has sold about 1 million copies of the earlier
       versions. Analyst Rob Enderle said the higher price of high-end
    entertainment computers which can easily run to $2,000 had restricted
     sales mostly to gadget enthusiasts and premium entertainment fans.

   Microsoft Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates is joined by
      actress and singer Queen Latifah as he demonstrates the Microsoft
      Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 at the Digital Entertainment
   Anywhere launch event held in Los Angeles, October 12, 2004. [Reuters]
   Now, Enderle thinks improved technology and more widespread use of PCs
    for entertainment could boost demand. "You can start to see what it's
                going to be like when it grows up," he said.

          Microsoft is now seeing many entertainment companies_from
   video-on-demand provider Akimbo Systems to news radio service National
   Public Radio_ jump on the bandwagon. The availability of songs, videos
    and other forms of entertainment from such partnerships could attract
                                 more users.

   Analyst Joe Wilcox of Jupiter Research said more consumers already are
     using PCs as an entertainment hub in their living rooms. Data from
   Jupiter also shows that about half of all consumers would be interested
                   in watching TV shows on a PC, he said.

    The new system will support high-definition television by the end of
   the year, in addition to allowing users to watch and record up to three
          television shows at a time and to pause live television.

    Another potential advantage for consumers is that advanced copyright
    protection technology will make it easier to legally transfer music,
   videos and other data from Media Center PC to portable players and cell
                                   phones.

      Entertainment computer systems also may become more affordable as
        computer makers roll out versions with fewer functions. Such
      scaled-down computers could cost as little as $700 with the Media
    Center software, said Brad Brooks, a marketing director at Microsoft.

      Beginning Oct. 17, users will be able to buy previously announced
   "extenders" for about $300 to transfer music or videos stored on their
             Media Center PC to another television or computer.

     For around $80, the company will soon offer technology that allows
   Microsoft's Xbox (news - web sites) game console to serve as a conduit
                            for music and videos.

   That's one element of Microsoft's plan to interconnect many of its home
   entertainment technologies. Another element, its MSN Music online music
     service that launched in test form last month, officially went live
                                  Tuesday.

Former CA executives charged with fraud

   US regulators on Wednesday levelled fraud charges against three former
   executives of Computer Associates, including Sanjay Kumar, the US
   software company's former head.

   The company is also to widen its own investigation into past accounting
   malpractice in an effort to reclaim some of the $1bn (?560m) in bonuses
   that were paid in the late 1990s to Mr Kumar and two other men who
   built the US software company, according to a person close to the
   group.

   The fraud charges, which include accusations against CA, cap the most
   widespread case of alleged accounting fraud to emerge from the
   technology bubble.

   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, CA mistated $3.3bn
   of revenues between 1998 and 2001, $1.1bn more than it had already
   reported.

   CA on Wednesday agreed to pay $225m in restitution to shareholders and
   agreed to closer outside scrutiny of its accounting and corporate
   governance to avoid immediate criminal indictment. The Departmnet of
   Justice has deferred its prosecution of CA for 18 months, giving the
   company room to escape a criminal case provided it meets the terms of
   its deal with the federal prosecutors.

   The settlement ends a saga in which CA become a symbol of weak
   corporate governance and suspect accounting in the technology industry.
   For years CA fended off questions about its accounting, though it
   eventually agreed to an overhaul of its board that brought in
   independent directors and closer scrutiny of past practices.

   That led to the sacking or resignation of most of its senior
   management, including Mr Kumar, who resigned under pressure this year.

   As part of its agreement with regulators, CA said it will dig into its
   past accounting and try to recover bonuses paid to senior executives as
   a result of accounting abuses.

   This includes an investigation of the events surrounding the $1bn in
   bonuses that were paid in 1998 to Mr Kumar, CA founder Charles Wang and
   Russell Arztz, another senior executive.

   The bonuses provoked protests, and the three eventually to returned
   part of the money to settle a shareholder lawsuit.

   The SEC accused Mr Kumar, along with Stephen Richards, CA?s former head
   of sales, and Steven Woghin, former general counsel, of fraudulent
   accounting and obstructing investigators.

   To meet stock market expectations, CA kept its books open at the end of
   each quarter to include sales made after the periods had ended, the SEC
   said.

Why aren't Scots shopping at Morrisons?

     *
     *
     *
     *

   11:27 Friday 22 October 2004

TROUBLE IS brewing in the aisles of Scotland’s supermarkets. Products and
produce once easy to hand are either on distant shelves or have simply
disappeared altogether. Safeway, the supermarket located in almost every
leafy suburb, is growing into a monster called Morrisons at a national rate
of three stores per week, and shoppers are less than pleased.

   In March, the supermarket chain famed for its rotisserie chickens,
   pitted olives and decidedly middle-class clientele was embraced into
   the family bosom of Morrisons - a smaller, English-based chain whose
   style is decidedly cheap and cheerful - when Sir Ken Morrison, the
   company’s founder, paid 3 billion at the City’s check-out. The first
   Scottish shoppers knew about the change was the removal of Safeway’s
   distinctive white plastic bags, to be replaced by Morrisons’ clear bags
   complete with the firm’s utilitarian yellow and black logo.

   For customers who found the colours aesthetically displeasing, more
   distress ensued as they toured the aisles with their trollies. Across
   Scotland’s 111 Safeway stores, the product stock was cut by 30 per
   cent, from 30,000 lines to just 20,000 lines. Result? The customers
   walked. In May, Morrisons reported that despite cutting the price of
   7,500 products in all Safeway stores, sales were down 13.8 per cent.
   Yesterday the extent of customer dissatisfaction was apparent as the
   company announced that Safeway’s half-year profits had dropped from
   131.6 million to 121.6 million.

   The irony is that while sales in Safeway stores have dropped by 13 per
   cent, the stores that have been re-branded as Morrisons are reporting
   an increase in sales of up to 10 per cent. In Scotland, to date, only
   three stores have been re-branded, those in the Gyle centre in
   Edinburgh, Newlands in Glasgow and a store in Dumfries. Two newly-built
   Morrisons have also appeared in Kilmarnock and Falkirk. But while the
   chain insists that every store now employs more staff than it
   previously did, customers are still lamenting the reduction in the
   range of available products.

   "When Safeway first arrived in Britain it had a high-end value," says
   Peter York, a style analyst. "One tends to think of Safeway in the
   King’s Road and Kensington High Street in London, but it has been
   losing its upmarket credibility in recent years. I’m surprised if
   Safeway customers had any particular perception of what type of store
   Morrisons is - unless, of course, they read the business pages. But
   there is the feeling among some consumers that they don’t want to pay
   less if they are losing choice."

   This is the case at the Safeway/Morrison store located at the top of
   Byres Road in Glasgow, at the hub of the city’s fashionable west end.
   For decades it has served a generation of public figures from former
   first minister Donald Dewar to TV presenter Kirsty Wark, but now many
   customers are looking elsewhere for their ingredients. The question is:
   could Sir Ken Morrison, Safeway’s new owner, care less if he loses a
   few food snobs but gains a flood of new customers keen on price cuts?
   As a former market stall-owner, the answer is probably not.

   When Morrisons floated on the stock exchange in the late 1960s, there
   were just four stores. By the time it bought Safeway this year, there
   were 119, stretching from Carlisle to London, many with petrol stations
   and cafs selling hot pies made in Morrisons’ own factories using meat
   from animals from the Morrison abattoir. The "Morrisons Mission" has
   always been to deliver the very best for less. This is the same "pile
   it high, sell it cheap" strategy on which Sir Jack Cohen built Tesco.

   IN PERSON, Morrison doesn’t smoke, barely drinks and enjoys plain food,
   as well as the occasional luxury. He lives in a grand Jacobean mansion,
   drives a Bentley and takes holidays in the Caribbean. Yet, according to
   Joanna Blythman, author of Shopped: The Shocking Power of British
   Supermarkets, he may well have bitten off more than he could possibly
   chew. In her opinion, yesterday’s results are unsurprising: "I think
   that Morrisons is a family business and it’s run in an old-fashioned
   way. When Ken Morrison bought over the Safeway chain, I think they had
   big ideas of what might have happened. Morrisons was a small family
   store and Safeway was a huge brand and that has been the problem. If
   Morrisons thinks it can swallow Safeway and then just compete with the
   giants of Asda and Tesco and global players like Wal-Mart then it has
   another think coming. When it took over the stores it wasn’t happy with
   the sizes of them. They were different to what it were used to and have
   different systems of management."

   The most popular supermarket in Scotland is Tesco, which holds 25 per
   cent of the market share. Asda comes a close second with 24 per cent
   while Morrisons/Safeway trail third with 19 per cent. This is a
   position Morrison is anxious to improve on, and many in the industry
   believe he is capable of doing so.

   Stuart Feather, managing director of Feather Brooksbank, the Edinburgh
   advertising agency who used to work on the Morrisons account, is
   dismissive of the notion that the supermarkets are of a lower class
   than Safeway. "Morrisons has a strong image and it is one of
   no-nonsense with an importance put on price and value," he says. He
   also points to their television campaign, which is comprised of
   ten-second commercials that list reasons to shop at Morrisons: "They
   are short, sharp and get the right message across."

   In Feather’s opinion, the supermarket is going through a transitional
   period, but will remain a major player. "I think they are a very strong
   force, but they are careful. One thing they are not going to do is
   over-promise and then fail to deliver. They have been very successful
   in the style of their larger stores, which are laid out like a
   street-market with customers able to move from section to section. In
   Falkirk, where they recently opened a large store, the feedback has
   been very good. People have raved about the quality."

   The perception that Morrisons delivers value for money is backed up by
   a survey carried out by The Grocer, the industry’s trade magazine,
   which found that only 11 per cent of Safeway’s customers wished to
   retain the brand name after the store’s takeover by Morrisons. A
   quarter of all Safeway customers said the shopping experience had
   improved since the takeover, with most believing they are getting
   better value for money. However, the survey of 1,700 shoppers also
   showed that there was lingering loyalty towards Safeway among older
   shoppers and those previously unfamiliar with the Morrisons brand, such
   as the customers in Scotland.

   THE IRONY IS THAT no sooner will loyal Safeway shoppers begin to settle
   into the Morrisons style of business then more changes will take place
   in their weekly shop. As many as 50 of the smallest Safeway/Morrison
   stores in Scotland are currently sitting on the shelf and are expected
   to be purchased by Somerfield within the next few weeks. Small stores -
   ie those with less than 15,000 square feet of floorspace - are not
   beautiful in the eyes of Sir Ken Morrison, and he’s keen to re-coup 200
   million from their sale. For all those shoppers who despise the
   brightly-coloured bags, the sale will only be welcomed.

Bed-linen Row: WTO To Begin Hearing

   A team of senior government officials from the textile and the commerce
   ministries will leave for Geneva on Monday for the first oral hearing
   of the compliance panel set up by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to
   examine Indias allegation against the European Union (EU) on the cotton
   bed-linen case.

   The panel was set up in June following complaints from India that the
   EU had not brought its measures of determining dumping margins in line
   with the ruling of the dispute settlement panel passed in March, 01.

   The decision taken by the compliance panel will be significant as it
   can quash the EUs attempt for a re-imposition of the anti-dumping
   duties on exports from India. The hearing will take place on September
   10-11.

   Senior textile ministry officials have told FE that the compliance
   panel may call for a second hearing before passing its verdict.

   In March last year, the dispute settlement panel had passed a ruling
   asking the EU to withdraw anti-dumping duties of about 12 per cent
   imposed on exports of cotton bed-linen from India.

   According to the ruling, the EU had violated articles 15, 3.4, 2.4 and
   2.2.2 of the anti-dumping agreement. While article 15 relates to
   exploration of possibilities of constructive remedies before imposing
   dumping duties, article 3.4 mentions factors required for determining
   the extent of injury.

   US mobile network operator AT&T Wireless today launched Ogo, its first
   non-voice messaging device, pitched at the 'yoof' market - in
   particular those who only like to communicate by text.

   AT&T Wireless Ogo The $129 clamshell unit provides a QWERTY keypad
   ready for instant messaging using AOL, MSN or Yahoo! protocols and
   email from those three providers and any other POP 3 account. The
   device also supports SMS messaging.

   Above the keypad and eight-way navigation control is a 4000-colour
   display. It also contains a dual-band 850/1900MHz GSM/GPRS radio.

   Ogo measures 11.5 x 7.5 x 2.5cm when closed and weighs 136g. That
   includes the 850mAh battery, which provides up to 2.5 hours of usage
   time and up to 120 hours' stand-by time.

   The handset is based on IXI Mobile's IXI-Connect phone-oriented OS,
   which incorporates its own Personal Mobile Gateway (PMG) system. IXI
   Mobile's PMG technology is founded on provides highly compact router
   and server code, and is geared to allow devices to connect to the PMG
   and gain internet access.

   PMG implies the provision of local wireless networking services,
   primarily Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, but if Ogo offers Bluetooth support, AT&T
   Wireless isn't mentioning the fact - though it did confirm the
   inclusion of PMG technology.

   IXI-Mobile's pitch is that PMG will allow a wide range of devices to
   gain wireless Net access. Alas, few manufacturers appear to have yet
   offered PMG-compatible products. Samsung is one, launching a PMG phone
   last year, but others appear thin on the ground - to the extent that
   IXI-Mobile was forced this year to launch a subsidiary, neo, to develop
   and market reference designs.

   Indeed, its neoChat NC-10 clamshell IM/email/SMS device looks
   remarkably similar to AT&T Wireless' Ogo clamshell IM/email/SMS device,
   updated with a colour display and redesigned keyboard.

   Ogo goes on sale in the US today. While the price is $129, AT&T
   Wireless is providing $30 back if you mail in a voucher. The basic
   monthly plan, which provides unlimited instant messaging, email and
   SMS, costs $17.99. That supports a single IM account - others costs a
   further $3 a month each. ®

Asia growth to hit 7%, bank says

                                              story.chinahondapartsafp.jpg

   The ADB says it expects China to post 8.8 percent growth this year.

   (CNN) -- Developing Asia and the Pacific will grow at 7.0 percent in
   2004 on strong exports and buoyant intraregional trade, the Asian
   Development Bank says.

   That is equal to the fastest growth since the 1997-98 Asian financial
   crisis and is up from 6.5 percent last year.

   ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali told CNN Thursday that growth in the
   region was now "much more balanced".

   He said the combination of strong exports, a sharp increase in business
   investment and continuing robust domestic consumption was keeping Asia
   buoyant.

   But he noted that by 2005, the impact of U.S. interest rate rises would
   flow through to Asia, and export demand among some of the region's key
   markets would ease as rates and the rise in oil prices began to be
   felt.

   In an update released in Manila, the ADB said it was lifting its 2004
   growth outlook slightly from 6.8 percent to 7.0 percent.

   The ADB defines developing Asia and the Pacific as all of the region
   except the advanced economies of Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

   It said in most countries, growth had become more broad based, with a
   fast expanding external sector and robust domestic demand.

   It said business investment, which had been lagging since the Asian
   financial crisis, has revived due to higher capacity usage, surging
   export demand, low interest rates and recovering business confidence.

   The ADB said that despite strong growth and higher oil prices,
   inflation remains "relatively subdued" and was projected at 3.7 percent
   this year for the region as a whole.

   It predicted an easing of growth next year to 6.2 percent as this
   year's oil price pressures and interest rate rises begin to have an
   impact on the region.

   It is projecting growth this year of 8.8 percent for China, 8.1 percent
   for Singapore, 7.5 percent for Hong Kong and Vietnam, 6.8 percent for
   Malaysia, but just 4.8 percent for Indonesia.

   In South Asia, the ADB sees growth of 6.5 percent for India and 6.4
   percent for Pakistan. One of the best performers in the Pacific is
   expected to be Fiji, with a growth outlook this year of 4.1 percent.

   The ADB said risk to the outlook include imbalances in the United
   States, Japan and the European Union, which could start to drag down
   world growth as 2005 advances.

   "High oil prices, if sustained into 2005, could result in a faster
   deceleration in growth of major industrial economies," it noted.

   It said governments in Asia needed to consider increasing domestic
   consumption to support growth if external demand turned down.

Japan narrowly escapes recession

   0 0
   [clock.svg] Friday 26 January 2007 20.59
   Japan - Consumption weak Japan - Consumption weak

   Japan just missed falling into recession after revised third quarter
   figures overnight showed much lower than expected growth of 0.1%.

   The Cabinet Office said the figure for the three months to September
   resulted in annualised growth of 0.2%.

   Analysts had been expecting the revised figures to show a gain of
   0.3-0.4% on the quarter and 1.2-1.8% annualised, especially in view of
   strong corporate capital spending figures announced last week.

   The Cabinet Office also said that under a new system of compiling the
   data, the economy had actually contracted 0.1% in the second quarter
   after expanding 1.7% in the January-March quarter.

   A recession is broadly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative
   growth, meaning Japan's economy just scraped by and came very close to
   a halt in the third quarter.

   A key factor in the poor performance was private consumption, which was
   much weaker than expected, increasing only 0.2% in the third quarter.

$210M Fine In AOL Probe

   Time Warner Inc. agreed Wednesday to pay $210 million to settle
   criminal securities fraud charges brought by the Justice Department
   against the company's America Online unit. The media giant also is
   prepared to pay $300 million to end another probe by the Securities and
   Exchange Commission.
   Under terms of the Justice Department settlement, prosecution on
   charges of aiding and abetting securities fraud will be deferred for
   two years provided AOL and Time Warner cooperate in an ongoing
   investigation into whether AOL improperly helped smaller Internet
   companies artificially inflate their earnings.
   An independent monitor will be chosen to oversee AOL's compliance, and
   the company must agree to a number of changes in its internal
   practices, Deputy Attorney General James Comey said.
   The agreement "gives AOL a chance to make amends for its conduct and
   clean up its act, in return for a stiff penalty and far-reaching
   reforms," said Comey, who heads the Corporate Fraud Task Force.
   Although no Time Warner or America Online executives have been charged
   with wrongdoing, the agreement does not provide them with immunity.
   However, four executives of now-defunct Purchasepro.com, a Las Vegas
   software company that had a partnership with AOL, have agreed to plead
   guilty.
   Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., say the
   partnership allowed both companies to inflate falsely their earnings.
   Time Warner also has proposed a $300 million settlement with the
   Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a person familiar with
   the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The SEC has been investigating accounting irregularities at Dulles,
   Va.-based AOL. The probe is focused on the manner that Time Warner
   accounted for a $400 million payment from the German media company
   Bertelsmann AG and whether that was used to inflate America Online
   profits.
   Last month, Time Warner set aside $500 million to cover the cost of
   settling the SEC and Justice Department investigations.
   Of the $210 million called for in the Justice Department settlement,
   $60 million will go to the federal government in fines and about $150
   million will go into a compensation fund to pay for settlements of
   civil lawsuits or other government actions arising from the alleged
   fraud.
   Court documents say that Purchasepro paid AOL $70 million in March 2000
   in a partnership that Purchasepro expected would bring it customers and
   revenue through AOL's Netbusiness section. But when the partnership did
   not generate expected cash, AOL began buying Purchasepro products
   directly and then helped the company mislead auditors about how the
   revenue was actually earned.
   The arrangement allowed AOL to report about $45 million in additional
   revenue in late 2000 and early 2001, while Purchasepro reported about
   $30 million in false revenue during that time frame, officials said.

Nintendo Envy

   By Chris Mallon | More Articles
   August 26, 2004 | Comments (0)

   An offhand comment by Bill Gates in a German newsmagazine has fueled
   speculation that Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT  ) wants to add Nintendo (Pink
   Sheets: NTDOY) to its stable. Gates was quoted as saying, "If [former
   Nintendo President] Hiroshi Yamauchi calls, he will be directly
   transferred to me." Yamauchi owns a large stake in the company, and
   essentially Gates has informed the world he'll be first in line with an
   offer should Nintendo decide to sell.

   The software giant is obviously serious about gaming, and there's no
   doubt that Microsoft would gain tremendously by purchasing Nintendo,
   which has video game franchises that include some of the best-known
   characters in gaming history, such as Super Mario Brothers, Zelda, and
   Donkey Kong. Nintendo competes directly against Microsoft for the No. 2
   spot in video gaming, behind Sony (NYSE: SNE  ) , which has the
   franchise PlayStation console, the world's top-selling video game
   machine. A combined Microsoft/Nintendo would pose a formidable
   challenge to Sony's dominance.

   Microsoft has made other strategic moves in its gaming business
   recently, including position cuts at its sports game studio, in an
   attempt to solidify relations with Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS  ) ,
   which dominates the sports games market. The two companies just
   announced collaboration on an online global soccer tournament.

   Microsoft, along with Sony, believes in convergence, where all
   multimedia devices are controlled from one central unit. Sony has
   already made a play at this market with the PSX (available now in Japan
   and next year in the U.S.), and Microsoft will have a kit for the Xbox
   this year to connect the console to a Windows PC. Online gaming is the
   crucial first step toward convergence, and Nintendo may have put up
   serious roadblocks to both Microsoft and Sony's plans.

   A recently updated patent gives Nintendo exclusive rights to some key
   online gaming technologies, including voice communications, online
   hosting, and most significantly, a gaming system with hard drive and
   Internet access. And because the original patent dates back to 1999,
   the possibility that Xbox Live violates it has to make Microsoft just a
   bit nervous. Perhaps Gates is falling back on one of his favorite
   business tactics -- buying a competitor with a technology that
   threatens his own.

   Sadly for Bill, Nintendo isn't for sale, preferring to stay
   independent. In general, Japanese companies are resistant to takeover
   attempts, and Nintendo shareholders would probably consider it a
   disgrace selling to an American company, particularly Microsoft.
   Whether the speculation ends here or not is anyone's guess.

Options Explained

   By Motley Fool Staff | More Articles
   September 10, 2004 | Comments (1)

   Imagine you want to invest in Legal Beagles (ticker: WOOFF), a new
   company providing legal advice for house pets. You can buy shares the
   usual way -- or you can buy options.

   There are two main types of options: calls and puts. A call gives you
   the right to buy a set number of shares, at a set price, within a
   certain period of time (often just a few months). For this right, you
   pay a price premium. Puts are similar, but they give you the right to
   sell shares.

   If WOOFF is selling for $50 per share and you expect it to rise, you
   could buy "October $55" call options for it. Let's say you snap up call
   options and pay $6 each ($600 total) for options to buy 100 shares of
   WOOFF at $55 apiece. If, just before your options expire, WOOFF is
   selling for $65 per share, you can exercise your options and buy 100
   shares for $5,500. Then you can keep them or sell them for $6,500.

   If you sell, you make a $1,000 profit, right? Nope. You paid $600 for
   the options alone, remember? So, your profit is down to $400 -- less
   when you account for trading commissions.

   Options are often risky (though there are ways to reduce your risk with
   them). If WOOFF stays at $55 or falls, your $600 would be entirely
   lost. It has to top $61 per share -- $55 plus $6 -- by October for you
   to profit.

   Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer. They point
   out that, if you have only $1,000, you can only buy 20 shares of a $50
   stock. Alternatively, that $1,000 could buy many more options tied to
   hundreds of shares of stock. True enough. With options, though, timing
   is critical. If things don't go your way in a short time frame, your
   option will expire worthless.

   Most options expire unexercised and worthless, in fact. (Those most
   likely to profit from options are the ones who "write" or sell the
   options.) That's because options are really about buying time, not
   stocks. If you're sure that WOOFF's stock will rise, you're probably
   best off buying its stock. Then, if it doesn't behave as you expected
   it to, you can either sell the shares or hang on patiently.

   Options are not for beginning investors, and even advanced investors
   might consider steering clear. But some investors do find them
   worthwhile. If you're really interested, make sure you do a lot of
   homework before jumping in.

   Here are some articles on options:

       Fischer
     * Bearish Options Strategies and Bullish Options Strategies, by
       Whitney Tilson

Coming Soon: Mobile TV

   By Rich Duprey | More Articles
   September 14, 2004 | Comments (0)

   As if people driving and talking on their cell phones were not enough
   of a hazard, a consortium of cellular companies wants to develop
   standards to deliver video to your handset. Great. Now we can have a
   nation of distracted drivers who are talking on their phones while
   watching TV.

   Under the aegis of the Open Mobile Alliance, five of the world's top
   cell phone manufacturers will collaborate on the mobile-broadcast
   specifications. Nokia (NYSE: NOK  ) , Motorola (NYSE: MOT  ) , NEC
   (Nasdaq: NIPNY  ) , Siemens (NYSE: SI  ) , and Sony Ericsson (Nasdaq:
   ERICY  ) will seek to find a way to bring TV broadcasts to smartphones
   with color displays, local memory, and multimedia applications.

   It would not be the first foray into mobile TV. Sprint (NYSE: FON  )
   offers some limited content through its MobiTV service, including the
   Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, some sports stations, and a
   variety of news services. It recently upgraded the service to enable
   15-frame-per-second streaming video on a Samsung phone. Sprint also
   launched its PCS Vision Multimedia Services that provides streamed
   content.

   Mobile TV is not such a sure thing, though, even with the industry
   heavyweights the alliance has behind it. For instance, it is unclear
   whether people will want to watch their local football franchise on a
   tiny screen (being a Giants fan, it's hard enough to watch them at the
   stadium, let alone on a very small screen. But I digress.). There are
   also issues such as battery life, audio quality (90% of mobile phones
   don't offer stereo sound), and size. These are phones, after all, and
   generally you want to be able to slip them into your pocket or clip
   them to your belt.

   The reason the companies want to try, even if they need to invest
   hundreds of millions of dollars to improve their technology, is because
   of the potential boon the mobile information/entertainment market
   represents. According to wireless consulting and research firm
   Alexander Resources, the mobile "infotainment" market will be a $7.2
   billion industry by 2008.

   Japan and South Korea already have mobile TV service, and it's expected
   that by the end of 2005 it will be available in Europe.

   Undoubtedly people will be willing to pay to have streaming video on
   the cell phones. Heck, they pay to download ring tones to their phone.
   Yet, as with many things in life, just because we can do something
   doesn't necessarily mean we should.

   Distracted drivers already are a major cause of accidents on the
   nation's highways. The New England Journal of Medicine found cell
   phones contributed to a quadrupled risk of collision. Adding reruns of
   Friends to the mix can only worsen the situation.

   Still, the potential for the technology brings new meaning to the
   phrase "I want my MTV!"

   Fool contributor Rich Duprey long ago found MTV to be unwatchable. He
   does not own any of the stocks mentioned in this article.

Success Can Be Bitter, Apple

   By Seth Jayson (TMF Bent) | More Articles
   September 16, 2004 | Comments (0)

   The worm may have turned for Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL  ) . After years --
   decades really -- of instigating, exacerbating, or at least cheering
   every regulatory swipe at Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT  ) , the captains of
   Cupertino are finally reaping what they've sown: heat from the
   bureaucrats.

   A U.K. consumer protection agency, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), is
   reportedly investigating claims that Apple is unfairly charging U.K.
   customers a substantially higher price for iTunes downloads than it
   charges customers on the European continent. Brits pay 79p for each
   song. That comes out to about 1.20 euro, or 20% more than the 0.99-euro
   price that French and Germans must cough up.

   The nonprofit Consumers' Association filed a complaint with the OFT,
   "urging them to investigate what appears to be anti-competitive and
   discriminatory behaviour by iTunes against UK consumers."

   Wow -- that sounds familiar. Sounds a lot like the same behavior that
   Apple, along with RealNetworks (Nasdaq: RNWK  ) , assorted other
   also-rans and, oh, the entire European Union, has been criticizing. But
   only when it comes from Microsoft, or might possibly come from
   Microsoft, even though that firm has yet to build any presence, let
   alone a monopoly, in the music download scene. (In the U.S., its Media
   Player software actually provides direct links to competing services
   such as Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT  ) , Roxio's (Nasdaq: ROXI  ) Napster,
   and Yahoo's (Nasdaq: YHOO  ) soon-to-be acquired Music Match.)

   Getting back to Cupertino's woes, while I'm tempted to sit back, smirk,
   and ask, "How you like them Apples?" I'm going to have to take the side
   of reason, and Apple, and tell it like it is: You Brits are way off on
   this. I've been to London and paid up for a fish and chips. You can't
   tell me the 100% markup over Caldbeck prices is due to real costs. It's
   purely a question of demand.

   Ever taken economics 101? Here's a refresher. Apple charges the Brits
   what it thinks they will pay, and a certain number of people -- 5
   million in all of Europe, according to some reports -- either shell out
   or go elsewhere. If consumers don't like the price, they can vote with
   their pounds, and demand will fall. Unless...

   They happen to have purchased an iPod. The iPod, true to Steve Jobs'
   xenophobic vision, won't play the Microsoft-formatted files available
   from most of the competition. That means iPod owners are probably stuck
   downloading from iTunes (or turning to the recent and controversial
   "hack" from RealNetworks). Now that sounds like a harmful exploitation
   of a monopoly.

   Sure, music lovers could use iTunes to convert the WMA files and
   clutter up their hard drives with needless dupes. But remember, in the
   EU, offering consumers a technical remedy as simple as an installation
   CD is not enough to keep the regulators off your back.

   OK, enough playing devil's advocate. Fans of free commerce should be on
   Apple's side in this dispute. To the Brits on board, I say: If you
   don't like the price, stop paying it. I guarantee that if you stop
   buying, Apple will lower the price. To Apple, I say, charge what you
   think is fair, but watch your back. Now that you're a leader for once,
   the haters are going to set their sights on you, whether you deserve it
   or not.

   For related Foolishness:
     * Review the spat between Real and Apple.
     * Europe's got a problem with success.
     * See why the EU really is becoming a banana republic.

   Seth Jayson wonders whether this defense will convince the Appleheads
   to finally lay off with the angry email. At the time of publication, he
   had positions in no company mentioned. View his stock holdings and Fool

Is Unilever Taking a Bath?

   By Rich Duprey | More Articles
   September 20, 2004 | Comments (0)

   Pity the poor Europeans. When it rains they don't eat ice cream, then
   they feel blue and don't look after their personal hygiene as closely
   as they should. Or so one would think after hearing Unilever's (NYSE:
   UN  ) reasons for cutting its earnings growth forecasts by more than
   50%.

   The Anglo-Dutch maker of Lipton tea, Dove soap, and the Vermont
   institution of Ben & Jerry's ice cream said sales growth would be less
   than 5% for the year and not the 10% it had previously anticipated.
   Europe's cold, wet summer had caused "substantially lower sales" of ice
   cream, and dour consumer confidence reports had caused consumers to
   spend less on personal care products.

   Somehow, even when I get into a funk -- for instance, when stock of
   mine has a bad day, such as Friday, when shares of Hidden Gems pick
   Flamel (Nasdaq: FLML  ) got a 22% haircut after Bristol-Myers Squibb
   (NYSE: BMY  ) backed out of a deal with them -- I still manage to drag
   myself to the shower and wash up with soap and water.

   Last year, Fools Jeff Fischer and Rick Munarriz dueled over who was the
   better purveyor of ice cream, Ben & Jerry's or Nestle's Haagen-Dazs.
   Perhaps there was something to Rick's assertion that by sticking with
   plain vanilla, Haagen-Dazs firmed its base while Ben & Jerry's hurt
   itself by having to come up with new flavors every year.

   More prescient was Fool contributor Richard Gibbons' take that Unilever
   was in need of some juice. He noted that the conglomerate has been
   having trouble growing revenues lately so that despite a
   reasonable-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 20, it showed
   disconcerting limited growth in shareholder value.

   Even as Unilever has tried to concentrate its focus on fewer brands,
   consolidating the number from 1,500 to about 400 so as to invest more
   heavily in its star products, it still anticipates their growth to be
   less than it was a year ago. In 2000, the company launched a five-year
   "Path to Growth" strategy that was supposed to focus on its leading
   brands. These premier products make up 95% of Unilever's group sales,
   but they rose less than 0.5% in the first half of the year, and
   expectations are that they will not make up even their anemic 2003
   sales of 2.5%.

   With a year to go on its Path and no letup in pain for investors in
   sight, Unilever appears lost, and the only bath it might be taking is
   in its stock price.

   Fool contributor Rich Duprey showers twice a day. He owns shares of
   Flamel but not of any of the other stocks mentioned in this article.

Fresh Del Monte's Bad Blip

   By Jeff Hwang | More Articles
   September 30, 2004 | Comments (0)

   When it rains, it pours.

   Shares of Motley Fool Hidden Gems selection Fresh Del Monte Produce
   (NYSE: FDP  ) are down 6% to $25 after the company cut its full-year
   2004 earnings forecast by almost 20%. The laundry list of reasons cited
   for the weaker outlook included weak banana pricing, lower melon
   profitability in the U.S., difficult growing conditions in Costa Rica,
   and the recent hurricanes affecting tomato crops in Florida.

   As a result, the producer and marketer of fruits and vegetables now
   expects full-year earnings to come in at $2.05 to $2.15 per share,
   rather than $2.55 to $2.65.

   According to CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, the company had factored in
   soft banana pricing, but that pricing has been even weaker than
   expected. He also said that while the fresh-cut and pineapple
   businesses continue to perform, margins are coming in weaker than
   expected in the company's other businesses.

   At first glance, the surprising thing would be that the stock is down
   only 6%. But the advantage to owning cheaper stocks is downside
   protection, and Fresh Del Monte generally qualifies as a cheaper stock
   at 12 times this year's revised earnings forecast. The stock is also
   trading at less than seven times last year's earnings of $3.65 per
   share.

   The clues as to why the stock is priced this way seem pretty apparent.
   Just glancing over fellow Fool W.D. Crotty's earnings coverage over the
   past few quarters, you get the idea that Fresh Del Monte's earnings are
   anything but predictable.

   At least in the short term, the stock market tends to reward some
   amount of predictability on top of actual production of cash flow. The
   counterpoint is that, going over Tom Gardner's review in the August
   2004 edition of Hidden Gems, I gather that he believes the company's
   continued product diversification and acquisitions -- such as the $340
   million agreement with Del Monte Foods Europe over the summer (see
   Producing a Great Acquisition) -- will help smooth out cash flow growth
   in the future.

   In the long run, what matters is that you think you've got the right
   price. If you follow Tom's reasoning, then you can regard today's
   earnings guidance revision as what poker players call a bad beat: a
   statistical improbability that produces a short-term hiccup in what
   will be a profitable long-term result.

Far and Away, a Worthy Telecom

   By Nathan Parmelee | More Articles
   October 4, 2004 | Comments (0)

   It's not every day I'm willing to take a look at a telecom company.
   It's an industry with pretty poor dynamics, and the antics of Qwest
   (NYSE: Q  ) and Global Crossing (Nasdaq: GBLCE  ) certainly don't help
   matters. But, like everyone, I have my moments of weakness.

   Last week, while running one of my favorite screens for value and
   income, I came across a telecom that pays a hefty dividend and for a
   number of reasons struck me as unique. You might say I've even had a
   bit of a change of heart.

   Before delving into some of the unique aspects of Taiwan's Chunghwa
   Telecom (NYSE: CHT  ) , I should note that many consider an investment
   in Taiwan, China, or anywhere outside of the U.S. to be taking on undue
   risk. To a certain extent I can understand this view, because
   securities regulations outside of the U.S. can be quite different and
   do require at least some investment of time to understand. That said, I
   think folks who read Chunghwa's Securities and Exchange Commission
   filings and compare them with, say, Nortel's (NYSE: NT  ) will find
   Chunghwa's filings rather refreshing.

   If you're already inclined to research Chunghwa further, you should
   know up front that the company's largest and controlling shareholder is
   the Ministry of Transportation & Communications (MOTC). In other words,
   Chunghwa is majority-owned by the state. To a certain extent, this
   limits Chunghwa's ability to react quickly in a competitive
   environment, but given the recent history of the telecom industry, this
   is not necessarily a bad thing.

   In addition, the company bylaws preclude issuing additional shares. Let
   me say that again just to make sure nobody misses it. Chunghwa is not
   allowed to dilute your ownership. Hallelujah!

   Now, before you send me email about how I'm just another
   anti-stock-option monger, understand that I'm not against stock options
   in theory. I'm just not thrilled with how they're accounted for.
   Investors in Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO  ) , Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM  ) , and
   others take note. There's a telecom investment out there that has you
   waking up in the morning owning the same percentage of the company as
   you did the day before.

   Still, there is one thing about Chunghwa that I like even more than the
   lack of dilution. It's the requirement that above and beyond certain
   requirements -- such as legal reserves and debt repayment -- the
   company must return excess capital to shareholders. Hence a beefy
   dividend yield that exceeds 7% at today's prices. Income investors will
   no doubt find that intriguing.

   With year-over-year revenue growth of just 2%, it's not likely that
   Chunghwa will be turning up in David Gardner's high-growth Motley Fool
   Rule Breakers. However, Chunghwa is doing a great job transitioning
   away from land lines and long distance service (cash cows) and toward
   growth areas such as wireless and data. All things considered, I'm
   hard-pressed to find a more attractive opportunity in the world of
   telecom.

A Marvelous 2005 and 2006

   By W.D. Crotty | More Articles
   October 28, 2004 | Comments (0)

   Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation Marvel Enterprises (NYSE:
   MVL  ) is well on its way to having $200 million cash, and no debt, by
   the end of the year. Today, the company announced that third-quarter
   net sales rose 60%, operating income was up 44%, and net income was
   down 46%.

   The net income drop was caused by Uncle Sam. Marvel has exhausted its
   tax credits, and the result of being a tax-paying corporate citizen was
   a $45.8 million "tax swing" -- more like a high-impact uppercut to the
   financial chin but good news for America.

   The softness in the net income increase is tied to the quarter's higher
   reliance on toy sales rather than the higher margin licensing of the
   company's stable of 5,000 characters.

   Income increased in all three divisions (licensing, publishing, and
   toys). Operating income, though, decreased for toys because of higher
   advertising and promotional spending before the competitive holiday
   season.

   What investors were waiting to see was the company's 2005 guidance. The
   Sony (NYSE: SNE  ) film Spider-Man spiked 2004 movie and toy revenue
   and earnings. But 2005 has an Achilles heel -- a sharp increase in
   development expenses for 2006 projects.

   Three feature films will produce revenue in 2005: Blade: Trinity, being
   released by fellow Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation Time Warner
   (NYSE: TWX  ) in December; and Elektra and Fantastic Four, both from
   Fox (NYSE: FOX  ) . Six feature films, four direct-to-video original
   animated features for a partnership with Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF  ) , and
   a Fantastic Four-based animated TV series will be in production for
   2006.

   As expected, without Spider-Man's U.S. release, 2005 revenue is
   expected to drop $110 million from the up-to-$500 million expected for
   2004. Surprisingly, 2004's net income of up to $111 million will be
   surpassed and come in at $126 million. The 2005 results won't include a
   $12 million charge for the early retirement of debt and Spider-Man's
   international box-office receipts and worldwide DVD income.

   In the past, Marvel has been conservative with its earnings forecasts.
   But it is worth noting that as its characters have established
   themselves as financial superheroes, and the company has become as cash
   rich as supervillains, it has been able to negotiate better contracts.
   Still, there is substantial risk in making any projections for a movie
   and toy business.

   Wall Street liked today's news and sent the stock up 10%. Long-term
   investors will relish the company's earnings multiple of 16, growing
   financial muscle, and powerful 2006 lineup.

Save Energy and Dollars at Home

   By Selena Maranjian | More Articles
   November 5, 2004 | Comments (0)

   Believe it or not, your friends at electric utility companies across
   the nation are offering you some ways to pay them less. Via their trade
   group, the Edison Electric Institute, they've compiled a list of local
   programs available.

   In their own words, the programs for residential customers offer:
     * Cash rebates given as incentives for purchasing or upgrading
       energy-efficient lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration, and
       water heaters.
     * Direct load control programs, where you allow your electric company
       to cycle off or shut down big energy-using appliances and equipment
       for certain periods of time. These programs are especially useful
       in the summer months on air conditioners, water heaters, and pool
       pumps.
     * Low-interest loans to help you afford high-efficiency equipment.
     * New construction programs, offering incentives and training to
       encourage energy-saving designs and the use of higher efficiency
       equipment.
     * In-home or online energy audits, providing an analysis of your
       energy use and specific recommendations for energy savings.
     * Personal energy management systems, providing automated meter
       reading with real-time information on energy usage and costs and
       allowing you to make informed energy use decisions before your
       bills arrive.

   Meanwhile, here are some tips on saving energy and money via your
   appliances:
     * Check and clean or replace air conditioning filters every month.
       Clean the outside condenser coil once a year. Reduce your usage by
       10-20% by caulking and weather-stripping your doors and windows.
       Make sure your attic is ventilated and your home sufficiently
       insulated.
     * Keep your refrigerator between 37° and 40°F and your freezer at
       least as cold as 0°F and not much colder. Keep your refrigerator
       filled to capacity, but don't overcrowd to the point where doors
       cannot be closed or air cannot circulate. Vacuum the condenser
       coils (underneath or behind the unit) every three months or so. Do
       not put uncovered liquids in the refrigerator. The liquids give off
       vapors that add to the compressor workload. Allow hot food to cool
       off before putting it in the refrigerator.
     * Reduce your refrigeration electricity usage by 40% by replacing a
       12-year-old or older unit with a new unit. An Energy Star unit will
       lower usage even more.
     * Microwave ovens use 90% less energy to cook with than conventional
       ovens. Convection ovens use a small fan to circulate hot air around
       the oven. This speeds up cooking time by about 30% and saves the
       same in energy. Combination ovens use microwave technology and
       halogen lamps to cut cooking time and energy use by 66-75%.

Boeing Wields a New Laser

   By Rich Smith | More Articles

   According to a Pentagon announcement issued Friday, last week Boeing
   (NYSE: BA  ) successfully completed a test of one of the coolest
   weapons ever designed (not their exact words). Specifically, it is a
   Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (which you'll no doubt notice comes really
   close to spelling "COOL" in acronym form) manufactured by Northrop
   Grumman (NYSE: NOC  ) and mounted on a modified Boeing 747 jet.

   The combined weapons system, unimaginatively termed the "Airborne
   Laser" system, is part of President Bush's 21st-century update of
   President Reagan's Star Wars missile defense program. If further tests
   go well -- and this code-named "First Light" test was just an
   intermediary step, in which the weapon was not even airborne and was
   fired for just a fraction of a second -- the Airborne Laser would be
   used to fly patrol near "countries of interest." There it would keep
   lookout for ballistic missile launches and, seeing one, shoot the
   missile down at the most vulnerable point in the missile's trajectory
   -- as it struggles slowly skyward against gravity, moving in a straight
   line.

   It's worth pointing out that, Star Wars-inspired or no, the Airborne
   Laser bears as little resemblance to Han Solo's blaster as, well, a
   circa-1960s IBM (NYSE: IBM  ) room-sized computer bears to a circa-2004
   Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL  ) Macintosh. For one thing, the Airborne Laser is
   a heck of a lot bigger, being composed of six linked modules, each the
   size of an SUV. It's also a lot less focused because of its laser beam
   refracting through the air over a distance of hundreds of miles and
   ending up, by the time it reaches its target, in a "pinpoint" the size
   of a basketball.

   So clearly there's still room for improvement in the system -- and
   that's probably fine with Boeing. Last week's successful test gives the
   Airborne Laser a chance to continue proving itself and Boeing and
   Northrop a chance to continue improving their product. It also gives
   them a good shot at continuing to receive funding out of the nearly
   $500 million allocated by Congress to the program for fiscal 2005.

   And if the program is ultimately successful? Why, that's the best part
   of all for sci-fi-loving investors. Because, you see, Boeing and
   Northrop are also teaming up to bid to build the successor to NASA's
   space shuttle. First laser guns, and now spaceships? Give 'em a few
   decades, folks, and mark my words -- these guys will build us an X-Wing
   yet.

Who Stole My Checking Account?!

   By Elizabeth Brokamp | More Articles
   November 19, 2004 | Comments (0)

   Think Internet fraud is something that only happens to other people?
   You might be unpleasantly surprised. I know I was. A couple of months
   ago, my SunTrust (NYSE: STI  ) checking account was drained of nearly
   $3,000 in a matter of a few days. But I can't blame SunTrust. The
   security failure was mine alone.

   How does a woman with two graduate degrees and what she hoped was good
   sense fall for a scam? The thieves had crafted an email (supposedly
   from SunTrust), indicating that the bank was concerned about some
   recent activity on my account. My job, according to the email, was to
   confirm my account number and change my password to prevent any further
   possibility of fraud.

   Once I "confirmed" the information, my transaction history began to
   look like something out of Roman Holiday -- someone in Italy was having
   a grand time with my money.

   I had always assumed that I would be able to spot Internet fraud a mile
   away, expecting emails characterized by amateurish design, riddled with
   misspellings, and rife with promises like "Send us $500 and receive
   water from the REEL fountain of youth." I did not, I am embarrassed to
